<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>Well, thanks so much for being here today for Build Day. Build Day&#x27;s really all about turning great ideas into great products, and so when we stepped back and asked what that might mean, we thought, well, no better company to talk to than Vercel, who&#x27;s very much at the forefront of making that possible, and Guillermo, in particular, who, of course, is the genius behind Next.js and Vercel in parallel. So, lots of good conversation to be had around open source- Good to be here, thank you. -And business. I think earlier this year</p>
<p>you guys announced 200 million ARR and a doubling of users year over year. For those of you who are reasoning about sort of scale and what might be possible, I heard 4.3 million downloads a week of your AI SDK alone. Yeah, it&#x27;s hard to keep count of downloads &#x27;cause they&#x27;re growing so fast. Good problem to have. But, yeah, the business has been growing really fast, and, as many others I think here, it was born in the cloud and it was born on Stripe. Amazing, and, you know, I think with many of today&#x27;s startups,</p>
<p>rather than reasoning about year-over-year growth, we&#x27;re increasingly reasoning about month-over-month growth or even week-over-week growth- Day. Day. Day? You could ship something today that makes a huge difference. Always elevating ambitions, amazing. Well, thank you for being here. I thought we could start maybe a bit with your background. Born in Buenos Aires, taught yourself how to code? True story? That&#x27;s right, yeah. Curious about kind of your early journey and what brought you to the US. You know, there are a lot of parallels between what I set out to do with Vercel in my early days because teaching myself to code and speak English was quite the challenge, but-</p>
<p>You taught yourself English? English was not spoken at home? The funny story, no. In fact, my parents were really interested in it &#x27;cause, in Argentina, like, the country was always divided between like capitalism and socialism. And my parents were very much like engineers themselves, industrial and chemical engineers, and they had a lot of admiration for great engineering. And they knew that the cutting edge would be in Silicon Valley in the United States, but you needed to know English in order to get there. And so I was interested in software engineering, and I noticed that a lot of the programming manuals,</p>
<p>documentation, readmes, were in English. So I basically had a bootstrapping process to do. And I tell people these days that, you know, AI is sort of a before and after because, if I go back in time and I&#x27;m trying to teach myself how to code, I can do it in my native language, and I can do it at every step. I can just ask the LLM to teach me. Like, literally, one of the things with LLMs is like, &quot;Explain quantum mechanics like I&#x27;m five.&quot; I could have done that. I could have- When you were five. You could have done that when you were five, yeah. So I didn&#x27;t have that. The next best thing was the internet, and the next, next best thing was open source.</p>
<p>So, for me, one of the discontinuities in my learning journey was when I started getting to know the open-source communities, contributing to open source, spending a lot of time connected with strangers on the internet, as one does, and learning together. And so I started contributing to a lot of web frameworks. One of the earliest was called MooTools. It was a JavaScript library, and that was actually very formative. You know, if I think of my resume, my resume was a bunch of the open-source projects that I contributed to. And the web itself was for me sort of the vehicle</p>
<p>that allowed me to basically leave Argentina and become a worldwide figure in programming because the instant that I was able to use the web to very quickly ship things, fork something and put it out into URL, now you have a worldwide audience, right? These hyperlinks can travel at the speed of, you know, thought pretty much. So fast-forward to Vercel and had the same inspiration. If you wanna start a company, if you wanna start a digital business, if you wanna ship your next big idea, I need to make it extremely easy.</p>
<p>I need to remove all of the friction. And, funny enough when I was here in Silicon Valley, I had already sold my first business to WordPress, I noticed that, you know, the cloud was all the rage. I always encourage people to think about platform shifts very closely. Clearly now we have a platform shift towards AI. Like 10 years ago when I started Vercel, the platform shift was towards the cloud. I looked at the cloud, and it was so hard, even though I had like 10 years of engineering experience under my belt. And so Vercel set out to remove all friction, from idea to global cloud application.</p>
<p>And so you&#x27;re kind of developing Next.js and Vercel, one open source, one is a business, in parallel. I&#x27;m curious like hard trade-offs along the way when you had to make a call, one versus the other. Yeah, where there was no trade-offs was in my vision. I wanna make the web easy, and so when I was thinking about it from first principles, something that you guys love to do here at Stripe, okay, I sat down, and I needed two halves of this equation. I needed the tooling, compilers, programming language, runtime framework,</p>
<p>and then I needed the cloud infrastructure. And so interestingly enough, I noticed an asymmetry in the market. I noticed an unmet need because most of the platform providers were leaving the framework side for you to figure out. So AWS and Google Cloud and whatever, like, here&#x27;s a bunch of like virtual machines and clusters and networking solutions. Right, you do the rest. It&#x27;s like the meme of draw the rest of the owl. They were like, &quot;Here&#x27;s some primitives. You figure it out how to build an application.&quot; And so I looked at it from first principles. I was like, &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s strange,&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;cause as I&#x27;m in the act of drawing this proverbial owl, I&#x27;m realizing I need tooling. And so that&#x27;s where the idea of Next.js came from. It&#x27;s like, hey, I wanna create an application that is of the sophistication, performance, and flexibility of the giants of the internet &#x27;cause I always caveat my little storytelling with, look, there were ways to publish to the internet really easily. You could have, you know, go to Squarespace or Wix or Tumblr. Like, there were ways to get something online,</p>
<p>but my aspiration was that you would be born- much like Stripe-like, your business is born on Vercel. It never graduates because we give you infinite scale and infinite power. And so I solved the Next.js side, made it open source, and then I also needed to solve the other equation with half of the equation, which is, all right, how do you host and scale this? And I also set a really high bar for myself. I wanted to make it universally performant. I wanted to make it such that without even being an expert in optimization or infrastructure, you could deploy something that scales</p>
<p>and performs excellently. And so those were the two things. One is more on the business side, and the other one is sort of our presentation to the world. Our cover letter to the world is start with Next.js or any other open-source frameworks that we contribute to. I mean, awesome that they were so hyper-complementary, right, additive. Were there hard trade-offs you made? I mean, even in your own time- Yes. Like where you spent your own time and energy? Yeah, it&#x27;s funny because I had to overcome a few bad, I guess, intuitions in order to get there. One intuition that I had at the beginning is:</p>
<p>in order to create the world&#x27;s best and most successful startup, I have to make everybody happy, like every single person. I feel like that&#x27;s just a life lesson. In order to be the best, yeah, you don&#x27;t have to make everyone happy. You have to be somewhat disagreeable. Yeah, so who did you agree to disagree with? So, interesting, and this is why like the story like seems so simple now that I tell it, it&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, wow, like, genius. Of course, you created the framework and the infrastructure.&quot; In the beginning, the infrastructure was so generic that I was trying to appeal to everybody. You liked Java.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, I can&#x27;t let Emily down. I&#x27;ll do some Java over here. Oh, and you like Next? Oh, okay, I&#x27;ll do some Next. Oh, and you...&quot; And so I really was just beginning to straddle myself like really thin. And so the principle that I&#x27;ve now extracted from this that I&#x27;m very happy to share with the world, because it can save you some pain, is your ambition for a venture-backed business that&#x27;ll reach global scale should be pretty much unbounded. Like, we&#x27;re here today. We&#x27;re gonna colonize Mars someday, sometime in the future. So that&#x27;s the like long-term aspiration and ambition. But you also have to meet it with realism</p>
<p>because, if you&#x27;re just pure unmitigated ambition, you&#x27;re gonna be so up in the clouds- not the actual cloud, but the, like, metaphorical cloud- that you&#x27;re not gonna get anything done. You might get into a situation being jack of all trades, master of none-extremely dangerous situation to be in. You might get into the situation of what some call it like, you know, having a million mediocre customers versus 1,000 customers that really love you. And so what was obvious in retrospect, and we did end up doing is, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;ll start by dominating a niche.&quot;</p>
<p>So the niche was- which is funny because I think a lot of things that we believe are niches turn out not to be- &#x27;cause we&#x27;ve had $250 million of revenue from a niche, which is front end. First chapter of Vercel was front end, hosting the front-end side of websites and web applications, and then CDN and security services. Our next step, which has come way later than I would&#x27;ve expected, is back-end: agents and the AI cloud, and all those things. In many ways, you have to earn the privilege to expand that product lineup</p>
<p>or that customer base in order to get to the ultimate ambition of your business. Actually, we&#x27;re seeing that in a lot of the companies that are being built now. What feels like a niche with like a global user base- and especially sort of like ability to reach markets that are well beyond our own-are not niches at all. They&#x27;re like very, very large markets. Okay, but you had to make hard trade-offs at the start. 100%. Had to shoot for the stars and then decide like which planet you were gonna land on first. 100%. You talked about like, you know, the new frontier is AI, and we&#x27;ve talked a bunch about open source versus closed source. I&#x27;m curious in the context of AI</p>
<p>how you think about open-source models versus proprietary models, both in terms of like what the industry is building, but also in terms of like how developers should adopt the two. One of the things that I believe is that once your business reaches product market fit, you can&#x27;t get too satisfied, right? Because the world will expect you to do more. Your customers will want you to do more. You&#x27;ll have the people and funding to do more. So you can, you know, expand into other adjacencies. And one of the rules for when do I expand into my next chapter- there&#x27;s a bunch of rules that I have or principles.</p>
<p>One is what I call brand permission, meaning if Vercel tomorrow launched a washer and dryer product, even if it&#x27;s slick and black and beautiful, you&#x27;d be like, &quot;That&#x27;s a little strange. I was expecting them to launch maybe like an AI coding tool.&quot; Like your brand doesn&#x27;t yet give you permission to launch a washer-dryer. And also you want to expand into adjacencies to your core competence. So, if you do payments, you can handle billing next. Or, if you do payments, you can handle fraud next and things like that.</p>
<p>And so, for us, with our new chapter of becoming the AI cloud, what we realized is that there is a lot of demand for the same things that we did in the past. People want simple frameworks, tools, and solutions for creating agents. There&#x27;s like a new protagonist in this story. I call it, first chapter of the internet was about pages or pixels. In fact, if you&#x27;ve used Next.js, you know that the very first thing we asked you to do was create a pages directory and toss your files in there. It&#x27;s like very much PHP-inspired.</p>
<p>The next chapter- Pages and pixels replaced by? Agents. And so agents might not even have a face, so to speak, intelligence that is sort of permeating everything you do, meeting you in every conversation, in every platform integrated into Slack, integrated into Zoom, integrated into, you know, parsing your documents while you&#x27;re doing other work. And so this is a completely different paradigm of the type of software that we&#x27;ve all been building. And this is why it&#x27;s exciting to start a business today because that feels to me like a platform shift,</p>
<p>and what&#x27;s interesting about platform shifts is that the old thing doesn&#x27;t disappear. So it&#x27;s not that tomorrow there&#x27;ll be no pixels or we&#x27;ll get to a point where there is no pixels. Much like today, we still have AM and FM radio, so the older technology is still there, and it&#x27;ll have- I think in the case of the web, pages and URLs and links are gonna continue to have a ton of relevance. But clearly there&#x27;s a new type of software people wanna build, and there&#x27;s a new opportunity then to provide the infrastructure and framework. So just like there was Next.js, we created the AI SDK. You called out it has 4.2 million downloads a week.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s actually gonna surpass Next.js. Next.js now feels old compared to like this new hotness. It&#x27;s like my new love interest. No, but they&#x27;re complementary. There&#x27;s like a foundations cloud, and there&#x27;s an AI cloud that you can build on top. And so whenever you have an idea for an agent or an assistant, you will naturally gravitate towards a platform that speaks your language, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re building now. Yeah, so you guys are really at the forefront of helping developers build with AI. We partnered with you to make Stripe sandboxes native inside Vercel. And I&#x27;m curious sort of how you thought</p>
<p>about integrating payments within your stack and why it felt sort of worthwhile to you. Yeah, maybe for some context, my original ambition transcended Next or Vercel or the cloud. It was, okay, if I have a great idea, how can I convert it into a productive software entity or business or whatever? And so my tool or my inclination was, look, JavaScript, I mentioned when I was a kid, I worked really hard to learn English, but I also worked really hard to learn JavaScript.</p>
<p>And what I really liked about JavaScript was it felt like the English of the programming universe. Of course, there&#x27;s lots of languages. Spanish is not too bad, but English, if you just learn English, think about how much you can accomplish. It&#x27;s awesome. Same with JavaScript. So JavaScript can run on the server side, client side, edge, build time. It can be used to provision infrastructure. And now our bet is it&#x27;s gonna be the main language of orchestrating AI services, making API calls to models, creating agents and workflows, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that was the inclination, is like, &quot;enable the world, broadly.&quot; Now, a little bit of a detour has been, well, kind of like ironically, perhaps, English is becoming the next hot programming language. So we created this tool v0 where it feels like a self-disruption. JavaScript allowed us to enable tens of millions of people to create, but that&#x27;s still a very small number. How many people can express ideas? So I&#x27;ll give you actually an actual proxy that I use.</p>
<p>Slack and Teams have approximately combined half a billion monthly active users. What do those people do when they open Slack? They, generally speaking, talk about building software or building some kind of business, and they go back and forth. &quot;Hey, Emily, how much money did we make yesterday?&quot; And she&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, what do you mean by money? Like, tell me exactly what MRR metric you want.&quot; It&#x27;s like, &quot;Okay, see you tomorrow.&quot; But we go back and forth in some conversation around building a business. Imagine if we could take those words and actually more directly and concretely build software.</p>
<p>That was the original idea of v0. And so for us, it means that we can take that pool of people that are in the creator sort of category from like 20 million to 500 million. And so we recently integrated Stripe because obviously what you learn when people start building software is that they wanna monetize it. So we made an integration such that every person that puts a prompt into v0 or creates an application into Vercel has a seamless integration with Stripe where you don&#x27;t even need to set up the environment.</p>
<p>You just get this sandbox provisioned. And it even surprised me, but it quickly became our third-most popular integration in the entire platform. It should not be surprising because anytime you build something, you need that flywheel of: is this actually working, and do people want it? And the best thing you can do is sell that thing and get feedback from the market. So it&#x27;s been amazing because I think, jointly, we&#x27;re enabling not just the people that know how to code or are proficient in coding, but now the next generation of, whether you call them vibe coders or not,</p>
<p>but it goes back to that original mission of enabling everyone to ship. Any sort of surprising businesses that you&#x27;ve seen spin up with sandboxes like that you didn&#x27;t expect, you know, just from going through? Well, there&#x27;s a lot of people that are building, like, ideas. They might have a main job, and then they&#x27;re like building sort of their, like, startup, their dreams on the side. I feel like I&#x27;ve seen an amplification of this, where, you know, for me, when I was at my previous company, I was dreaming of the company I was gonna create next.</p>
<p>But I think the barrier- But you weren&#x27;t building it yet. The barrier felt too high. It was too hard. That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s right. And so I think there are a lot of people now that, you know, one thing that&#x27;s been really surprising is younger people. So obviously, I had this story-my personal story-of like, I had to learn quite a bit in order to actually become someone that could sell something online, just integrating all the services, programming languages, et cetera. I&#x27;ve been hearing from people that are professional engineers that tell me, &quot;Look, my siblings, they&#x27;re like 12, 13 years old, and they&#x27;re already selling products online.&quot;</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s also been really surprising. The other one that&#x27;s even more surprising, perhaps, is within enterprises, the same sort of inclinations are in play where people have ideas, but they don&#x27;t have the resources to execute. And so giving them a tool that can enable fast prototyping... One that was maybe not related to payments specifically but was bewildering to me is we heard about a company that went from v0 to patent filed just through like prototyping, trying it out,</p>
<p>going back and forth with customers, visualizing the idea, et cetera. Like, okay, this actually is a meaningful evolution of our business. Without a tool that allowed them to move this fast, they need to like get engineering resources. They need to do all these things. So there might be a renaissance of, you know, it seemed like the only way that a enterprise scale could innovate is by acquiring a startup or by some people leaving and starting a startup where like they were free to innovate and use tools and move really fast. I think there&#x27;s a version of this that&#x27;s gonna happen within existing companies,</p>
<p>and it&#x27;s been exciting to play a role there. I can&#x27;t get out of my head this vision of like a five-year-old Guillermo, doesn&#x27;t speak English yet, in Buenos Aires, sitting at a v0, you know, computer. What would you build? So it&#x27;s happening already, right? So one thing I&#x27;ve been struck by is people send us like the really cool things they build with v0. They share the chats in our community, et cetera. And it&#x27;s been amazing to see that a lot of these chats are not in English. Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, like, the LLMs just don&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>Is it as performant in non-English? So this is the other thing that&#x27;s been shocking. So I&#x27;ve only had limited exposure, so I haven&#x27;t done a rigorous analysis, but from my vibe-ometer, Spanish is amazing. So that young Guillermo maybe would not speak English today &#x27;cause he continued- Wouldn&#x27;t have needed to, yeah. building in Spanish. But the other thing that&#x27;s fascinating is this is not a one-way door, right? A lot of people are starting with v0 and they&#x27;re becoming proficient engineers later. A lot of people ask me like, &quot;Do you believe</p>
<p>that this tool replaces the engineering role?&quot; I don&#x27;t think so, and I already have enough evidence from seeing people telling me, like, &quot;I spent three months in v0. It opened my mind to the different kinds of special skills that it could develop later. And now I do this, and I connect to Git, and I use other tools. And I&#x27;m going towards that journey of proficiency.&quot; I don&#x27;t think people should necessarily stop at prompting. In fact, this is how I quote, unquote, &quot;code&quot; today. Whenever I have an idea, it&#x27;s actually way more practical for me to put it into v0</p>
<p>and send a prototype to my team than try to express the same idea either in Slack or text messages or whatever. Or, you know, sometimes the friction to coding and creating an environment, it&#x27;s just too high. And so I think these tools will continue to coexist in order to help people dream up really big things. Okay, so your own developer experience- Vercel&#x27;s obviously known for an incredible developer experience. AI is changing what it means to be a developer. What do you think good developer experience is gonna look like a year out, two years out, three years out?</p>
<p>Yeah, one thing that&#x27;s definitely changed in how we operate internally is that we talk of the LLM as our customer. So it used to be that I designed Next.js only for people, and the persona that I would imagine in my head is, all right, there&#x27;s this developer. Maybe they&#x27;ve had some exposure to PHP. Maybe they know some HTML. How can I relate to them? In fact, and I haven&#x27;t shared this too broadly, but the very first version of Next.js looked a lot like a templating language &#x27;cause I really badly wanted to merge the world of React,</p>
<p>which seemed a little divorced from the mainstream of programming at the time, and I wanted to make it super relatable. I wanted to make it like MySpace codes. I wanted to make it like, &quot;Oh, it just looks like HTML with some JavaScript logic on top.&quot; Or even Shopify Liquid looks a little bit like this. And so my customer was that developer. And, whenever I design something, I try to think of a very broad range of skillset. This has been sort of like a personal mantra that I have. I call it progressive disclosure of complexity, which is actually something that&#x27;s really hard to do.</p>
<p>How many years old is Stripe? I mean, it depends when you count from but like slightly over a decade. Okay, so in ten years, a company will add more and more complexity commensurate to the customers that come in and the deals that they make. So, if Stripe is supporting Shopify, the needs of Shopify are way more advanced than the needs of a one-person shop. So, how do you maintain the simplicity of the early days, when it was mostly used by one-person shops, ten years in? And so my personal rule is, one, it&#x27;s possible.</p>
<p>It requires a ton of work, but the rule is progressive disclosure of complexity or sophistication, meaning you still should present yourself where you meet the needs and complexity and experience of that customer that comes in through the door. And then over time, if needed, you reveal your more complex self. And so I think there&#x27;s a version of that happening now where, in order for me to make a product that is good for one person or a one-person team or we now host two of the top 20 websites on the internet by traffic,</p>
<p>I need to be very, very cognizant of how do I expose the complexity to the end user. But, again, that end user is no longer just a human. We think of the agent and how is the agent gonna reason through this. Little example from literally last night. One of our framework builders that works on what do we call agentic developer experience, he said, &quot;Look, what happens when agents use Next.js is that they will boot up lots of dead servers and kill them and boot up lots of dead servers and kill them.&quot;</p>
<p>And this is not a behavior that a human does. A human boots up one. They go to work to their tech center, that&#x27;s it. And, in some ways, agents are better because they try lots of things really quickly, and if you give them rope, they&#x27;ll do a lot of stuff in parallel. And so what we realized is that in one error message in Next.js, we had to include the process ID in order to give agent context of what process to kill in order to recover the port that the previous process was using. This tiny amount of information- hashtag and then identifier of the process-</p>
<p>is enough to boost the developer experience, not for people, maybe actually marginally for people &#x27;cause like what I would do if I was an engineer is like, oh, I would run PS and then grab my Next and then find the process and whatever. Like, not a huge difference for people can make a gigantic difference for agents. And so, as developer tools continue to advance, they will continue to cater to this LLM that calls tools and commands rather than people. The people will still be behind the agent instructing it. The other metaphor that I use is that, you know,</p>
<p>instead of thinking of yourself as a junior engineer that joins a company, you&#x27;re basically like a junior engineering manager that joins a company, and what you&#x27;re managing is a fleet of agents. I like successively revealing complexity. I&#x27;m wondering if that works in personal life as well. Yeah, I meet you and we start talking about something basic, shared, and then we can end up talking about like colonizing Mars. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let&#x27;s talk about business models. Business models in the AI era are different, unique, complex. I&#x27;m curious how you&#x27;ve thought</p>
<p>about Vercel&#x27;s own monetization strategy, business model, and kind of what you&#x27;re seeing in the market with all the businesses being built on v0. Yeah, when you engineer platforms, some of the early decisions that you make can be highly regrettable in the future. One of them is how you structure. I think a lot of people that have built products might relate to this, for example, how you structure users, teams, organizations, workspaces, roles, et cetera. You make some decisions, and then you wake up five years later,</p>
<p>and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, I wish I&#x27;d done it differently.&quot; And I think there&#x27;s a version of this with pricing models. So if young, five-year-old Guillermo in Argentina was asking me today like, &quot;What advice do you have for like how I should structure my pricing?&quot; I would say- I feel like that&#x27;s a question you might have asked. Yeah, totally, especially because I would be chatting with the LLM, and the LLM would be like, &quot;Yeah, you have to think about this.&quot; But so, for a couple rules of thumb. So one is optimizing for high-iteration velocity, not just of your product, but your pricing and packaging and the way you bill. Like, it&#x27;s gonna undergo constant change. Another one is optimizing for transparency.</p>
<p>One of the big weapons that Vercel has today relative to old incumbents is that you can buy anything off the shelf, and then we transparently tell you how much it costs down to a very specific unit, request, data transfer unit, token of AI. And the world has very much evolved to this way of buying, where you have a session with an agent like v0, and then we tell you like, this part of the conversation literally costs you this many credits because you used up this much of intelligence. So, we very much live in a world where everything is on tap.</p>
<p>Intelligence is on tap and power. I think of cloud computing as power. I almost think of what Vercel does as a utility. You want us to scale to infinite concurrency. So, for example, we host all of the prediction markets. We host Polymarket, Kalshi, and a bunch of the crypto ones. Today they&#x27;re probably having a massive day. Why? Because everyone&#x27;s hitting refresh on the New York election. I&#x27;ll probably do it when I leave this room. Hey, I could see you&#x27;re antsy. You wanna know what&#x27;s happening. And so Vercel is basically letting you draw</p>
<p>as much power as you need. And we do it in a way that they didn&#x27;t need to call &#x27;em and say, &quot;Hey, there&#x27;s an election coming up. Can you just give me a little bit more power, bro?&quot; No, it&#x27;s like on demand, and that means that we need to optimize for a system of enormous transparency, real-time accounting. So you can go to Vercel and-at any time, in real time-see, all right, how many requests, how many compute microseconds. Same for the build process. So, if you have 100 engineers or one engineer, we can provision one build unit or 100 build units. Your team grows.</p>
<p>You can draw more compute. The same is happening with tokens, right? There&#x27;s some engineers at your company that will be having very long sessions with the agents. There&#x27;s some that are gonna be more parallel. There&#x27;s some people that, you know, frankly, as much as I am agent-pilled, I have some engineers working in some frontier domains where AI gives them no returns today, people working on very advanced compiler or cloud infrastructure that there&#x27;s just not enough data or whatever. And so you need this very fluid model of accounting, billing, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so what I would be thinking today when you think about your pricing model and how you monetize is- especially if there is an intelligence component or a power component- how do you do some of that real-time transparency back to your customer? But also, the SaaS models are still very relevant. There&#x27;s a lot that is rightfully metered by seat or by project or by some other kind of unit. So, where Vercel exists today is kind of a hybrid world of this very much on demand and also for some things that are more related</p>
<p>to collaboration, other aspects of building software, more traditional like you would pay for GitHub or Figma or others. And, of course, Stripe has evolved to meet this level of complexity. Yeah, we do. We see a lot of this hybrid billing model, right? You want the sweet, sweet ARR, but you also don&#x27;t wanna charge the same amount to the person who&#x27;s using, you know, in browser base like a couple hours a month as the person who&#x27;s using thousands of hours a month. And, I&#x27;ll tell you, sometimes entrepreneurs can get into a little bit of a cold-start problem because if you do everything on demand, then you might have 100,000 customers that pay you like 3 cents a month.</p>
<p>And you have fixed platform costs. You have platform costs because you had to like get something up and running in order to just be online and serve your user base. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m actually, number one, I&#x27;m a fan of extreme experimentation. I think no one really knows the answer to these hard problems, and so you have to get out there and try many things. But the other one is that I think I&#x27;m quite open-minded about like more of the hybrid ways, and obviously it&#x27;s great that, you know, you have a lot of the infrastructure already built. So doing it for yourself I do not recommend. It&#x27;s quite hard.</p>
<p>I wanna jump back to something you said earlier about like the web today is built on pages. Pages aren&#x27;t going anywhere, but there&#x27;s kind of a new dominant interface that&#x27;s popping up. We didn&#x27;t really talk about... We talked a little bit about what that&#x27;s gonna demand from the infrastructure layer. We didn&#x27;t really talk about what that&#x27;s gonna demand in terms of new protocols, and I&#x27;m curious sort of what&#x27;s top of mind for you. Yeah, one thing I mentioned briefly is if the programming language of tomorrow is human, that means that you&#x27;ll likely be integrated into a lot of the places where the conversations are already happening. So, if you and I are chatting on WhatsApp,</p>
<p>then we might create a group with a bot that is there in WhatsApp, or if we&#x27;re in Slack, same thing. So, the interface that has been the poster child of this first era of AI is conversation, in talking to these agents, in prompting, and I expect that to continue. What&#x27;s also true is that a lot of these platforms already exist. So there&#x27;s already ChatGPT. There&#x27;s already Grok. There is already v0. There&#x27;s already Cursor.</p>
<p>And so paying attention to the protocols that allow you to meet customers where they are. Literally, this morning I was getting a really nice- I was telling you about it- pitch about a data AI company. And the founder&#x27;s making the case that one of the key interfaces for his product is gonna be the MCP server because a lot of companies are building their own AI interfaces. I meet a lot of enterprises that have basically their own internal ChatGPTs. We have one at Vercel. You guys have one. Shopify has one. And so your product</p>
<p>might not have a pixel interface, per se. You might just come to the company and say, &quot;Hey, Stripe, if you connect to our MCP server over here, you&#x27;re gonna get this value from us.&quot; So, I&#x27;m paying a lot of attention to MCP. We have a lot of customers in e-comm. Black Friday is gonna be a huge day for us, also for Stripe, of course. And a lot of the questions that I get are, &quot;How do I survive and thrive in an age of agentic browsers?&quot; Meaning, you know, the customers tells it like, &quot;Get me this beautiful black sweater.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a beautiful black sweater. Do you think agent commerce is overrated or underrated? I thought you were gonna ask me, &quot;Where do you get it?&quot; No, I don&#x27;t need one, but it looks- I don&#x27;t think agent commerce is overrated because I think, at least for myself, I always get the same things, the same black shirts 200 times a year, and so there is a kind of purchase that you make that is very predictable. Again, context is king, always has been, even more so now within in the age of AI. That little example that I gave you of like we improved the Next.js error message by five characters,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, like, the world works way better- the same is true for how you bring context. That&#x27;s just a way of doing context engineering. The concept that we put into the agent determines the quality of the outcome. For commerce, I think if you have really good context in like what my preferences are and my history of purchases, there&#x27;s a lot that you can automate. I expect it to play a role even in the world of pixels because what a lot of merchants- the dragon that they&#x27;ve been chasing and have never quite gotten to- is that you open favoriteshop.com, and it knows exactly what you want</p>
<p>instead of a generic static page. This is literally why Vercel like... A lot of our business, why it&#x27;s so successful, is we helped people not ship static pages and dynamically render and personalize. But I think a lot of these pages and interfaces are gonna be LLM-backed. So, imagine behind the scenes of producing a page, there&#x27;s an LLM with a lot of context. And imagine that the tool calls that it can make is the orchestration of your UI components. So, all of a sudden when I go to, you know, keith.com, the LLM is producing the page.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the mental model that I have. Now, some people are gonna go to keith.com. Some people are gonna go to chatgpt.com. And so you need both. You need the protocol to integrate it into big chat, and you also need to, yourself as a business but also the way that you should think about it, is empowering the businesses that also wanna maintain their own interfaces with the customer. And with this new customer that&#x27;s the LLM, both at the same time? Yeah, the customer might be an LLM. The customer might be a traditional user. The way that I think about it is when I go to the airport, and I walk past my favorite store, I might still be inclined</p>
<p>to have a human-centric experience. So I walk in and I explore, and ideally I would want that to be hyper-personalized and tailored to me. Another interface will be the agent browser, meaning I tell it like, &quot;Get me my black sweater again,&quot; and it just goes off and gets it. And then the other interface will just be purely the agent that you&#x27;re not directly interfacing with but some other agent. So this is kind of the agent-to-agent model. There&#x27;s an e-commerce agent over here, but I&#x27;m interfacing with some other agent that in order to fulfill its purpose, it needs to buy something. We did a little demo.</p>
<p>I mean, this sounds like science fiction, but we did a little demo of this with Stripe, where imagine that you&#x27;re coding, and you&#x27;re talking to a coding agent, and you tell it, &quot;Deploy.&quot; And the agent-you haven&#x27;t made a deployment decision yet- the agent says, &quot;Well, in order to deploy it, I&#x27;m gonna use Vercel &#x27;cause it&#x27;s the best.&quot; How does that agent successfully procure a Vercel account and pay for it, so that what it gives you is actually the outcome that you wanted? You wanted a live URL or you wanted a deployment, and it just fulfilled the commercial transaction</p>
<p>as an implementation detail. Obviously, you will want oversight. You want your payment methods to be, you know, persisted. You want fraud prevention. You want all the good things of buying, but think of it as like my assistant is doing the purchase. I mean, there&#x27;s disproportionate talk of agentic commerce in the B2C context, but I think the B2B is far under-discussed, and procurement could look very different a year from now. Amazing, that is all we have time for today, and a huge thank you to Guillermo for the insights shared. I know I&#x27;m walking away with a lot</p>
<p>and hope you all are too. - Thank you all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Checkout introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, this is a walkthrough of Stripe Checkout, a pre-built payment page that helps you quickly accept online payments. Whether you&#x27;re selling products, subscriptions, or services, Checkout makes it easy to convert more customers with a payment experience that&#x27;s optimized for conversion, security, and ease of use. In this video, we&#x27;ll cover how Stripe Checkout works, how to choose between Stripe hosted and embedded Checkout, how to add features that boost your conversion rates, and developer resources. Let&#x27;s</p>
<h2>Understanding Checkout</h2>
<p>get started. Stripe Checkout is a pre-built payment form that&#x27;s designed to convert more customers and reduce development time. Stripe offers two ways to integrate checkout, hosted and embedded. With hosted checkout, [music] customers complete payment on a page hosted by Stripe. Just redirect your customer to the checkout URL and Stripe handles the rest, including security compliance and optimized payment flows. [music] This is the simplest option with minimal code required. With embedded checkout, the payment form appears directly on your website, giving you more control</p>
<p>over the customer experience.</p>
<h2>Optimizing for conversion</h2>
<p>Whether you use hosted or embedded, Checkout uses AI models to dynamically surface the most relevant payment methods based on many onsession signals [music] such as popularity among other customers, as well as showing prices in their local currency. Checkout also handles tax collection, supports subscriptions, and can be customized with your branding.</p>
<h2>Developer resources</h2>
<p>Let&#x27;s walk through how to start integrating with Checkout. All Checkout integrations use the Checkout Sessions API to create payment pages. If you want to use Stripe Hosted Checkout, add an endpoint on your server that creates a checkout session on your website. Add a button that calls your server endpoint and redirects your customers to the Stripe hosted payment page. Your customers complete payment on Stripe secure page and are then redirected back to your site. For embedded checkout, which appears directly on your website, you&#x27;ll use the</p>
<p>checkout sessions API to also create an embedded form. [music] If you don&#x27;t want to start from scratch, you have two options. Quick starts located in Stripe docs are full working code samples of checkout integrations [music] in various front-end and backend languages. Simply select your preferred language [music] and follow the step-by-step guide that combines both server and client implementation. Then download a full sample app or install the Stripe VS Code extension to get step-by-step help from our AI assistant as you add the integration to your codebase.</p>
<p>Or you can start with sample projects that demonstrate checkout in real world scenarios. These samples include complete [music] applications for both hosted and embedded checkout with source code available on GitHub that you can clone and customize. Whichever way you choose to get started, Stripe provides developer tools such as the Stripe CLI and Workbench. These tools help you test the [music] complete payment flow, including successful payments and handling postpayment events. That&#x27;s an overview of Stripe Checkout, a powerful, flexible way to accept</p>
<p>payments online. Create an account or log in to get started.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Introducing Stripe Payment Links</h2>
<p>Hello, this is a walkthrough of Stripe payment links. A simple way to start accepting online payments in minutes without writing code. Choose payment links if you want to sell online without a website or accept payments in person via QR code. In this video, we&#x27;ll cover how to create a payment link, how to share it with customers or embed it with a buy button on your website, and how to configure your checkout experience with multiple payment methods.</p>
<h2>Creating a payment link</h2>
<p>To get started, log into your Stripe dashboard. From the dashboard sidebar, click payments, then select payment links. Then on the payment links page, click new to get started. You can choose between selling products or subscriptions at a fixed price or allow customers to choose what they pay. For this example, let&#x27;s sell a product at a fixed price. Select products or subscriptions. You can add an existing product from your catalog or create a new one. To create a new product, click plus add new product. Enter the product</p>
<p>details, including any images and descriptions, and set your price. You can offer one-time purchases or recurring subscriptions. For subscriptions, you can set billing intervals like monthly or yearly and offer free trials. You can also automatically calculate and collect the right amount of tax with Stripe Tax. Once you&#x27;ve configured your product, click create link to generate your payment link. After creating your</p>
<h2>Sharing your payment link</h2>
<p>payment link, you can share it multiple ways. Copy the link to share via email, messaging apps, text to pay, or social media. You can also generate a QR code that customers can scan with their phone. To use your own domain, go to business settings in the dashboard and add a custom domain for your payment links.</p>
<h2>Adding a buy button to your website</h2>
<p>If you have a website, you can embed a buy button or card widget on your site using your payment links. After creating your link, click buy button to customize its design and generate the code to paste into your site. When customers click the button, they&#x27;ll see your Stripe hosted checkout page. Payment links automatically support over</p>
<h2>Configuring your checkout experience</h2>
<p>75 payment methods, helping you convert more customers globally. Payment links also support Link, a wallet built by Stripe. Link allows returning customers to pay with a single click using their stored payment information. The payment link uses AI models to dynamically surface the most relevant payment methods based on many on session signals such as popularity among other customers. For example, customers in Germany will see options like SEPA debit while customers in South Korea might see options like Samsung Pay. You can</p>
<p>configure payment methods from the dashboard. That&#x27;s how you can use Stripe payment links to sell online without writing code. Create an account or log in to get started.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Introducing Stripe Billing</h2>
<p>Hello, this is a walkthrough of Stripe billing, a solution that helps you launch any revenue model quickly. Use billing if you offer subscriptions, bill on usage, or need to generate invoices. In this video, we&#x27;ll cover how to set up subscriptions and usage based pricing, how to create and send professional invoices, and how to try to recover revenue from failed payments using Stripe Billings recovery tools. This video is forformational purposes only and shows one example of a configuration. Your configuration might require additional steps depending on</p>
<p>your region and local regulations. Let&#x27;s get started. Stripe billing lets you</p>
<h2>Create and manage subscriptions</h2>
<p>create and manage subscriptions for your products or services. Billing supports over 15 pricing models from simple flat rate or per seed subscriptions build at regular intervals to more complex hybrid and metered pricing. To create a subscription, you&#x27;ll need two key components: products and prices. A product is what you&#x27;re selling, like a basic or premium plan. A price defines how much your product costs, the billing interval, like monthly or yearly, and the currency. A single product can have multiple prices for different billing</p>
<p>intervals or currencies. After saving a product and price, create the subscription in the dashboard or by calling the subscriptions API. Once you&#x27;ve set up your subscriptions, [music] you can use tools like trials and coupons to help drive growth. For example, you can offer free trials to let customers try before they buy. You can choose whether to require a payment method at the start of the trial and if so, whether the trial automatically converts to a paid subscription or cancels at the end. You can offer</p>
<h2>Setting up &amp; managing usage-based billing</h2>
<p>pricing that reflects your customers actual usage of your product with usagebased billing, a flexible alternative to subscription pricing models. With usage based billing, you charge customers based on their consumption of your product or service. This is ideal for services like AI models and applications, cloud storage, or infrastructure services. To implement usage based billing, begin by defining a product with a metered price. For example, you might charge a certain amount per gigabyte AI token or API call.</p>
<p>During each billing period, your system reports the customer&#x27;s usage to Stripe through the Stripe API with meter events, which is capable of processing up to 200,000 events per second. Then, Stripe automatically calculates the amount due based on the reported usage and your pricing model. Customers pay only for what they use. You bill for the exact value delivered.</p>
<h2>Create, customize, and send invoices</h2>
<p>Stripe invoicing lets you create, customize, and send invoices. Invoices can be automatically generated for subscriptions, or you can create one-off invoices for individual purchases at an additional cost. To create an invoice, go to the invoices section in your dashboard and select create invoice. You can add line items, apply discounts, and include taxes. Stripe also lets you customize the appearance of your invoices with your logo and brand colors. When you&#x27;re ready, you can send the invoice via email or share a link that lets customers pay online. Stripe</p>
<p>helps you get paid faster by tracking invoice status, retrying failed payments, and sending payment reminders. Revenue recovery tools can help reduce</p>
<h2>Managing revenue recovery tools</h2>
<p>and recover failed recurring payments so your business can collect more revenue. With billing&#x27;s revenue recovery features, businesses on Stripe recover $12 on average for every $1 spent on billing. Smart retries uses AI to retry failed payments at times when they&#x27;re most likely to succeed. You can set up automated email reminders to notify customers when payments fail, when their invoice is unpaid, or when their trial is ending or renewal is approaching. We&#x27;ll even automatically update your customers saved card details when their issuing bank replaces a physical card. This helps ensure uninterrupted</p>
<p>payments.</p>
<h2>Getting started with Stripe Billing</h2>
<p>Stripe billing can be managed through the dashboard for many common setups. For more customized integrations like automating subscriptions or reporting usage for metered billing, you&#x27;ll use the Stripe API. Stripe docs have what you need to integrate billing, including comprehensive documentation, client libraries in various languages and quick start guides. That&#x27;s an overview of Stripe billing, a powerful system for managing subscriptions, usage based plans, invoices, and revenue recovery.

      <title>Companies applying emerging technologies to lesser known frontiers</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnzbIL-huR4</link>
      <description>Our users are bringing new technology, standards, and opportunity to every industry. We spoke with Lucid Bots, who save lives by building cleaning robots, or Archistar, who are using AI to speed up property planning applications by 50%, or Katalyst, who build fitness techwear that intensifies your training 6x. We also spoke to pioneers in their industries like Playdate, Atomic Industries, Light, Sorcerer, and Masquerade, who are innovating in some of the lesser known frontiers.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnzbIL-huR4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnzbIL-huR4</a></p>
<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>In the year 2025 Playdate is very different than anything else that exists out there. Video game hardware projects? Kind of uncharted territory. Rocketry and aerospace engineering became a thing. Why did we not elevate manufacturing to that same plane of existence? The skill that we needed to actually make things is almost completely depleted. What we&#x27;re trying to do here is actually preserve very precious trade skill and ultimately scale it. There&#x27;s not a lot of software being developed around power and utilities. We&#x27;re hoping to build the tools and the critical infrastructure</p>
<p>that the entire grid needs in order to operate in this new world. This is a unique product that doesn&#x27;t really fit into any existing category. In 20 minutes you&#x27;re getting a workout that&#x27;s like two hours of an intense gym workout. It&#x27;s doing the workout to my body and that&#x27;s really different from anything I&#x27;ve seen over the last 40 years. When people talk about permitting, it sounds simple. Design your building. Get your permit. Proceed. In reality, that permitting process can take longer than actually building the house. We built the Archistar platform to generate building designs</p>
<p>that comply with the local city rules. And that has never happened before. Every four days somebody passes away cleaning a building in the United States. So we started with building a drone that can clean buildings. We&#x27;ve had to solve problems that others haven&#x27;t addressed. How do we get a drone to fly with stability in the most complicated environments where most drones quite simply can&#x27;t? Weather forecasting was one of the first fundamental problems that humans have tried to solve with technology. The ways in which we collect that data hasn’t changed much since the eighties. Masquerade is an original show inspired by Phantom of the Opera</p>
<p>but in a way you&#x27;ve never experienced it before. We invented technology for this show. The way the microphones are triggered across six floors, across six casts, the cueing of all the music. It&#x27;s so madly technical, and yet it&#x27;s all designed to feel like it&#x27;s just happening. About 80% of the world lacks accurate weather information. In El Salvador, a one-day forecast is about as accurate as a seven-day forecast in Florida. We can launch the Sorcerer weather balloon from San Francisco and navigate them to pretty much anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>They float for months collecting thousands of times more data. This is the first time in history that something like this has been possible. I can&#x27;t really think of anyone that has tried a new platform with its own SDK and its own everything. There&#x27;s something super special about putting that game on a thing that you&#x27;re holding in your hands. It&#x27;s like, oh my God, I made a console game. Price of power is incredibly volatile. Power prices will put cryptocurrency to shame. Explaining to customers is really difficult. Talking to devices is very simple. We can talk to an EV</p>
<p>or talk to a home battery tell it when to use power, when not to. We&#x27;re shifting power consumption to when it&#x27;s abundant, cheap, and renewable. Classically we&#x27;re very trapped in a mindset where manufacturing is just cost optimization for everything. I can save a penny here, a nickel here. And ultimately nobody is thinking about, if I could just make my entire product 10 times faster how much is that worth? We&#x27;re here in the LA office to help the recovery for the wildfires. There are 12,000 homes that were burnt. What Archistar is doing</p>
<p>with technology is getting those permits out the door. So that we can build faster. It is saving applicants 50% of the time to get a permit through. Not being in the Broadway arena was critical to the innovation that we were allowed to even entertain in our minds. You are literally like this in our show. You are literally a foot away from these Broadway singers pouring out their hearts right next to you. This is truly frontier technology. We&#x27;re tethered by a hose to the ground. So every foot I go up in height is a</p>
<p>different weight profile. I need to be able to counteract high flow rates, pressures up to 4,000 PSI. You can go into an EMS studio and you&#x27;ll see people standing in a squat attached by a wire to a very complicated-looking control panel. What we&#x27;ve done with Katalyst is we&#x27;ve incorporated that all into a self-contained suit with an impulse pack that connects wirelessly to an app for home consumers.

      <title>Tacit: Fingal Ferguson, Master Knifemaker</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD1bI4LGobw</link>
      <description>In this episode of Tacit, we follow Fingal Ferguson, a fifth-generation farmer and master knifemaker in West Cork, Ireland. Fingal divides his time between the farm and the forge, where he handcrafts knives prized by chefs around the world. His work reflects a form of expertise that cannot be fully written down or automated. You can study metallurgy or knife design on paper, but knowing when steel is ready to move or how a blade should feel in the hand comes only through years of practice and close attention to materials.

Fingal’s craft is an example of tacit knowledge: expertise that develops through repetition and proximity to other makers. In an era of AI-generated output, his knives show what machines still struggle to replicate: judgment shaped by experience, care, and embodied understanding. Tacit is a series about that kind of mastery, and why it matters.

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>The biggest honor there is as a knife maker is to actually see some guy who bought your knife. And you see years later you go back there and you see the worn used handle and the blade from sharpening. Out of all the knives there it was one being used. And that&#x27;s a beat your chest moment. The Fergusons make</p>
<p>Gubbeen cheese in the townland of Gubbeen in West Cork in Ireland. My name is Fingal Ferguson. I&#x27;m the fifth generation on the farm. On my father&#x27;s side a long line of farmers. And my mom&#x27;s side is probably more of an interested one of more worldliness. Dad has a security and amazing steadfast way of being so efficient and logical in such a casual way. And mom was so creative</p>
<p>and quite brilliant and such a strong character. My sister Clovis I jokingly refer to her as the white witch of Gubbeen. She can heal you through food. I have kids. I want them to be proud of where they grew up and what they do. And you know one of the Fergusons being me also happens to make knives. As a butcher</p>
<p>through this whole process I always worked with a knife. This physical object this thing that basically wasn&#x27;t eaten and didn&#x27;t disappear. All my friends through the cheese and through everything else, they were chefs. The tool of the trade to all of these people that I had come to love was the knife. Knife making in general is a very simple process that actually you can complicate and simplify as much as you want.</p>
<p>You have to find the metal. You have to make it hard. And you have to make it into the shape and put a handle on it. And there&#x27;s no such thing as the best knife steel in the world. There&#x27;s just the best knife steel for that one job. You&#x27;re gonna forge out a thickness into this steel. There&#x27;s a point where the steel is softened. It&#x27;s annealed. It&#x27;s in this point where you can bend and you can straighten it and you can do all these things to it. When you violently change the temperature of a piece of steel and shooting it up to 1080 degrees centigrade and then crash it back down to sort</p>
<p>of room temperature in three seconds, it&#x27;s so hard that it&#x27;s actually brittle. It&#x27;s fragile. So at this stage you now have a blade that isn&#x27;t finished, but it has been transformed. Muscle memory is I think, to me, a knife maker&#x27;s tool of instinct. What I mean by that is you&#x27;re on the grinder. You&#x27;re holding something in your hand. You close your eyes and you almost will automatically put it back in the same place, at the same angle, at the same pitch, at the same yaw.</p>
<p>The whole thing. You&#x27;re looking at the shadow that&#x27;s being cast from the light that&#x27;s behind you against the product. And using that shadow as a guide to see how close or how far you are from the platens. It&#x27;s a subconscious means of sort of knowing things and that helps you through the longevity of a process where you can disappear into that. Hello? Sorry there&#x27;s actually a crisis</p>
<p>going on at the moment. Is there any way you could courier it to us and let us know the cost of that? Or should I arrange a collection? I suppose. I feel very connected to to the chaordic word. To some people that could be an insult. To me it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a sign of winging it moving forward. And maybe probably moving faster than you should be. Hot, hot, hot. That is not</p>
<p>normally how it happens. The knives don&#x27;t go off. They don&#x27;t go stagnant or stale. So I need to basically know that I can stop here and go and prioritize the farm and anything else that needs my attention. And I do that willingly. You can see that there&#x27;s a family relationship that leads me to a certain shape of the blade. I find that</p>
<p>your first impulse the first thing that comes to your mind usually 90% of the time is the one you should go with. The first instincts are very powerful. These are some lovely Damascus blades. I have some high-carbon steel ones here. These knives are worthy of a little accent a little twist. This is the spine of a Spinosaurus. I&#x27;ve got pieces of mammoth ivory. That little piece of it can slip in between the bolster and the handle. There is an element of personal choice. You&#x27;re going to shape the handle.</p>
<p>This is all about ergonomics. There&#x27;s a balance and there&#x27;s a weight and there&#x27;s a feel. There&#x27;s a thickness you can feel in the fingertips. This step is something very unique to myself that I&#x27;m proud of because it&#x27;s both functional but also visually appealing. At the very end when you feel like it&#x27;s finished really you&#x27;re probably still at 80%. You have to go over it. You have to look at it closely. Find those imperfections. Test it. The fact that it can</p>
<p>cut paper is one thing. What&#x27;s really interesting is actually the sound it&#x27;s making while you&#x27;re cutting it. So there is a point of maybe tear, if that&#x27;s amplified. It&#x27;s one element of what you&#x27;re listening for. Or sometimes if there&#x27;s just one little part of the edge that isn&#x27;t quite right, you can hear it. And I think I can see a bit there that maybe I&#x27;d nearly touch up. So that&#x27;s one of the knives.</p>
<p>And then this is a knife I haven&#x27;t fully sharpened yet, properly. Are you hearing a difference? Slightly. And also one of the things that&#x27;s kind of important and a nice test as well is the push cut. If I&#x27;m going to push on the exact same place as opposed to the pull, a pull cut. So all of these elements are are telling me something. So it&#x27;s a tool. It&#x27;s also fun and it</p>
<p>makes an incredible mess. Beauty to me wasn&#x27;t somebody wearing a wonderful outfit very elegant and beautiful in respects of the eye of the beholder. Beauty also came from a wildness and originality and seeing beauty in something very simple and them wanting to master that. If I was to be asked</p>
<p>if I&#x27;d mastered knife making, I hope not. It&#x27;s lovely to see an evolution. And I&#x27;m very curious to see how that evolution will be in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tacit: Christophe Laudamiel, Master Perfumer</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwyOvhRIpu4</link>
      <description>In this episode of Tacit, we spend time with Christophe Laudamiel, master perfumer at Osmo, and the creator behind some of the most recognizable fragrances of the past few decades, including Polo Blue, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce, and Tom Ford’s Amber Absolute.

Perfumery is a field built almost entirely on tacit knowledge. While formulas and chemical structures can be written down, knowing how a material behaves in heat, how it changes over time, or how a composition will settle on skin cannot be learned from text alone. That knowledge develops over many years and thousands of small judgments, many of them unconscious, shaped by experience and repetition.

Christophe’s work shows how mastery emerges through sustained engagement with complex systems. Tacit is a series about that kind of mastery, and why it matters.

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>I want you to make me a fragrance that evokes fear. So fear. I think I would do something very electric like before the storm. We can do that in perfumery. We have molecules to do that. And even certain naturals like chamomile blue has this uncomfortable feeling of a very raw rubber, even. And, uh I think I would put some wet stones, like in a dungeon or in a medieval torture room.</p>
<p>Not that I know that, but- And, uh what would I put? I would put something a little dry a little mossy maybe. Certainly musty and something very unpleasant. So a clash. So in perfumery, how would I do a clash? Maybe patchouli with very wet or very dry notes. So you have the wetness, mossiness from the stones, like in an old cemetery, and then you would have</p>
<p>something very dry. And it&#x27;s very unsettling actually for people. And we can do both. Oh look, this is the store. Do you like the store? Yeah. And look, what is this? I&#x27;m Christophe Laudamiel. I&#x27;m a master perfumer. For me, I&#x27;m actually better with things that have a lot of personality and things that people want to make a mark on the market.</p>
<p>I make signature scents. I&#x27;m the creator, or one of the major co-creators, of Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford Amber Absolute, Fierce by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, and some others.</p>
<p>From a very young age I was always exposed to a lot, a lot, a lot of scents. Whether it&#x27;s in the tropical forest, in the mountains there, or in the mountains of the alps, or in the dormant volcanoes where I was born actually. My aunt and my uncle, they were working in the Michelin testing facilities. And you know that&#x27;s where you run the cars over and over again. I loved the labs. And in the lab, everything has to be perfect. It&#x27;s like a car. Because if in a car you&#x27;re not perfect. You go off the road,</p>
<p>and you kill yourself. Michelin at the time was equipping Formula One cars. And after that Michelin equipped the space shuttle, the American space shuttle. So for me, I could see how when you do the best then you get to some really cool project that&#x27;s also that. And then you pioneer things because by doing new things, it brings another one, and then it brings another one. One thing that&#x27;s been in my mind from the beginning, I wanted to create the Pixar of perfumery. I&#x27;ve always strived for</p>
<p>people to understand that perfumery is just like any other art. You have to do your own imagination. Just like in front of a picture. When I smell something, I see myself somewhere. If you want to create for other people then it&#x27;s how to make something that triggers the emotion you want to trigger in that person. You don&#x27;t learn in the school that.</p>
<p>You learn in projects on the job. You have to learn psychology, basically. It&#x27;s like a perfume psychology. I bring you a little carrot. What do you think? Mais oui? Look. I need to smell this now. You see? Look. It’s very nice. Oh, this stinks. Look. You like this one? You like this one? Or which one you like? Oh, this one is good. What about this one? No, this one is not good. And this one is not good either. Only the one in the middle.</p>
<p>Yeah. Very nice. Mais oui! Someone just wants the smell of jasmine when the bush is blooming on the west coast of California. When you extract a flower it never smells like the real flower. Like jasmine absolute doesn&#x27;t smell like jasmine on the branch. So you have to reconstitute the feeling of the natural jasmine. I don&#x27;t want it to be too direct. I want the greenness of the leaves.</p>
<p>And I want the- maybe a little bit the woodiness of the bush. You see? So maybe if we have a little. Do you see here? There you see nothing. But there&#x27;s nothing to see because the particles are mini, mini, mini. And then you smell like that. So this is nice but I think it&#x27;s still not green enough. So what I&#x27;m going to do, because we see too much of floral, we see the fruitiness of the jasmine. Yeah. And so then I&#x27;m going to rewrite the formula. So I can write on the computer or I&#x27;m going to write like that.</p>
<p>So I need to make number 16. Sometimes I don&#x27;t know. And it&#x27;s when I write it that I start to decide what I want. So ethyl benzoate, 10% instead of pure. Now I&#x27;m going to dilute it 10 times. But if I start to think, to think, to think, to think. It&#x27;s still thinking. But now let me think. This space here is like</p>
<p>my private painter studio. You know, you can have your big studio where you do all your biggest pieces of art and then you have your private thing like on the weekend. I&#x27;ve had this for many, many years now. Actually I established it in 2010 in another location, and I kept it with me. You see? I have all my medals from kung fu. And then more medals here from kung fu. Yeah, I like all this. And here I have my bed in my lab.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s very important because I don&#x27;t make a difference between private life and perfumery life. When you are an artist, that&#x27;s how it is. You know? And this is a scent spray that&#x27;s from a friend in Los Angeles, a perfumer in Los Angeles. It is very eucalyptus rosemary. But I love scent. And I love to use them in different ways. I don&#x27;t spray before going to bed because it makes me think too much. Whether on my skin or on the pillow, I would never spray. Because then I start thinking of the fragrance, how it should be built, how I built it,</p>
<p>how, no. It&#x27;s a nightmare for me. I cannot sleep. Okay, 104, 525. I do have to fight against ingredients very regularly to make the fragrance smell the way I would like it to smell. Voilà. Okay. And then plus 45.1- I always say chemistry is non-linear logic and perfumery is non-linear logic. We should put a bit of</p>
<p>tocopherol in there. Do we have tocopherol? No. A molecule has 4,000 parameters to describe a molecule. Do you understand? Just one. You have a hundred in the fragrance. So people that are logical go crazy. In perfumery you put something you put twice as much and it&#x27;s still not twice as strong. Plus there are so many parameters. So people get lost. You have to know which ones are going to be the most important that are going to make a difference. So there was once when you and a collaborator discovered an unwanted wet dog note.</p>
<p>Yes. In a composition. Yes. Oh, that was a nightmare. When there&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t like in a fragrance, how do you go ingredient by ingredient? So for instance, what we do, we would take the formula, like we have this one. So this one has probably 30 or 40 ingredients. We line them up here on the bench and then I re-smell them one by one. So you smell them and then you say, okay, could this have a little facet of that. And then you smell. You smell, you say, could that have another facet that&#x27;s missing and then together they do that? But I&#x27;m going to see now that I have wet dog in my mind.</p>
<p>And the other day here at Osmo it was the I say the kitchen rag the dirty sponge. Oh, this smells. When that shows up, it&#x27;s horror. It&#x27;s horror. And I cannot think of one ingredient in here that smells of wet dog or one that smells of the kitchen rag. And then, well, actually I can think of one, but it was not in there! So then when you don&#x27;t find it in the ingredients or in a combination of ingredients in your mind, then you reweigh the fragrance. All the green notes and all</p>
<p>the woody notes separately to try to isolate the culprit or the culprits. The perfume industry&#x27;s relationship with innovation is very poor. The last revolution is the pump. Okay, which came in the seventies. Tell me the innovation in advertising, advertising, fragrance for her, fragrance for him and voilà. And then the pump. Why don&#x27;t you have perfumery in the news? Why don&#x27;t you have perfumery reviews</p>
<p>in the Wall Street Journal when something comes out? Because they&#x27;re lacking innovation and they&#x27;re lacking disclosure. They&#x27;re lacking transparency. So journalists cannot talk about something that is so secret and you cannot verify. And when you scratch there&#x27;s not so much innovation. Something around it. Yeah, texture or maybe some tulips around. Yeah voilà, tulips around. All around, yeah voilà. Fantastic. I love that smell. I want the public to know that when you buy a bottle for $300 most of the time it is not</p>
<p>because the ingredients inside are expensive. No, this is not because of the amount of fragrance in the bottle. It is not because you have to pay the harvesters in Madagascar or in Egypt. The charm on the bottle is more expensive than the juice inside. When you create for these brands you get some interesting ones. But it&#x27;s rare. I want to do exciting projects. And I want to showcase the artistry of perfumery. For this, you have to create jobs in the industry that don&#x27;t exist.</p>
<p>So when Osmo asked me one day if I wanted to join as a master perfumer, I said yes right away. Osmo is this new fragrance design studio using AI and perfumers to create new styles of perfumery. We could not have been here a hundred years ago because we didn&#x27;t have the science. We didn&#x27;t have the knowledge. Now the computer screens about 300 million molecules. We are going to screen about seven billions. To do that it would take one perfumer 66,000 years.</p>
<p>With the AI you get new fragrance structures. And there is always something interesting in those structures. This is what you are doing in the lab that when I pass by I was like oof! I get dizzy. Actually, this started when we asked the OI to screen already a hundred million molecules. And the 301 came up. So when I smelled 301 it was actually very oceanic, very fresh. And I said, okay, we should dig around that molecule more because we need new oceanic notes. And then the chemist and the OI working together</p>
<p>sent to our table this 3 9 1 3 0 6 that smells of melon. I don&#x27;t care how the OI thinks, I see the OI as another colleague that thinks differently from me. What also is really important which is unique at Osmo. I don&#x27;t know one chemistry lab next to a master perfumer&#x27;s lab in the world. Where&#x27;s the- Yeah, this one. Oh my god. This is so nice. This is crazy. You don&#x27;t need to go to perfumery school to know how to do melon anymore.</p>
<p>If you take that, it&#x27;s a photoshop. Click the melon. Cut and paste, melon. You see this in real time. This is fascinating. You know some people when they feel they have done big things or they feel they&#x27;re there. Me, I still feel like a student at university. It&#x27;s like just one step. And I don&#x27;t know where the road is going. Make me a scent that evokes optimism.</p>
<p>Optimism. So I would have something super bright, super yuzu, citrus, lemon but twisted. I love the smell of lime, which is underrepresented in perfumery. And optimism it means the base is also very strong. But the base would come into the fragrance. So like strong woods or spices. Some spices I see them as very emphatic and very energetic and very warm also. For me, optimism, there&#x27;s a big, big hug that takes you somewhere</p>
<p>and opens your mind. So also abstract notes like floral ozone, like nitriles, like things like that, that brings you in the outer space. And you don&#x27;t want to think of the past and it makes you think towards the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ben Thompson from Stratechery on AI ads, the end of SaaS, and the future of media</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUSWtLu2RCE</link>
      <description>Ben Thompson, the internet’s premier tech analyst, joins John for a wide-ranging conversation on the mechanics of the internet economy. They discuss the origins of Stratechery and the "1,000 true fans" model, why Taiwan is the most convenient place to live (and the best Uber Eats market), and why the public markets are wrong to think SaaS is "canceled." Ben also explains why the US failure to control the TikTok algorithm is a disaster, why he’s a "crypto defender" in an age of infinite AI content, and gives John some very direct feedback on Stripe’s ACH implementation.

<h2>&lt;Untitled Chapter 1&gt;</h2>
<p>Ben Thompson is the founder and author of Strategy, the newsletter that everyone in tech reads to make sense of what&#x27;s happening. He&#x27;s also heirly to the premium newsletter model that&#x27;s become very popular in media nowadays. For many years, he ran Strategy as a solo founder in Taiwan. Cheers. Good to see you. Cheers.</p>
<h2>Visiting Taiwan</h2>
<p>&gt;&gt; It feels like people in San Francisco have not properly discovered Taiwan as a tourist destination. Like, do you agree with that characterization? What&#x27;s your recommendation? People always ask me about Asia and the way the way I always characterize Taiwan is there&#x27;s lots of great places to visit in Asia &gt;&gt; and I would also put Japan on the list. But I, you know, I like to think I went to Japan before it was cool. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Nothing against Japan. It&#x27;s just &gt;&gt; Well, the whole thing with Japan is going to Japan pre-smartphone was a completely different experience than going there post smartphone. &gt;&gt; Like you think, oh, the subway system&#x27;s amazing, the trains. Try navigating that with no smartphone and nothing&#x27;s in</p>
<p>English. Like like Japan used to be very low on English. Uh it&#x27;s still lower than places like Taiwan. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s surprisingly low. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Japan it just has the the way to visit Japan is you just walk like don&#x27;t go to like set destinations. &gt;&gt; Um where but the way I would talk about this is places to visit but the best place to live is undoubtedly Taiwan. &gt;&gt; The one word everyone says for Taiwan sounds not that impressive but the word is convenient. &gt;&gt; Like it is the most convenient place to live. So part of that is actually &gt;&gt; 7-Eleven has really good food.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s actually downstream from the Japanese cuz Taiwan was a Japanese colony for the first uh 50 years of the 20th century. And it&#x27;s laid out a lot like why is it great to walk around Tokyo? Cuz Tokyo is all mixed use, right? That&#x27;s how Taipei is as well. You have these big blocks where the exterior will be commercial and the interior of these big blocks is all residential and the first floor is all like small shops or restaurants, things like that. So, wherever you live, you basically have access to everything all around you. But the the I think the downside as a</p>
<p>tourist is it&#x27;s kind of an ugly city. Like Taiwan&#x27;s kind of notorious for just these dumpy, dilapidated buildings and you go inside and they&#x27;re like palatial on the inside. Like Taipei is very very rich. It&#x27;s like in the top 10 I think as like number of billionaires in the world or something like that. All downstream from building out China, things like that. It&#x27;s a very beautiful country. from Taipei, 30 minutes to the ocean, 30 minutes to the mountains, East Coast is amazing. &gt;&gt; But if people listening to this are visiting, like I feel like one thing they should do is it&#x27;s a mistake to try and use Yelp or anything like that too</p>
<p>much cuz like you should maybe just try and go to a night market and follow your belly and see see what looks good and like a lot of excellent street food. And so that&#x27;ll be one thing is to don&#x27;t try to over plan. Well, here&#x27;s a problem though where tech tech has made it worse, I would argue as a tourist, which is uh Taiwan is arguably the greatest Uber Eats market ever &gt;&gt; because there there&#x27;s amazing options. It&#x27;s all delivered by scooter, so it&#x27;s always like 10 minutes to get to get dinner and things along those lines. I think you were going to ask me about difficulties moving to the States. Not having access to that is definitely one</p>
<p>of them. But the problem is that it&#x27;s such a huge market now that I think there are fewer and fewer restaurants &gt;&gt; in that a lot of these places actually just straight up close their storefronts are just ghost kitchens basically &gt;&gt; and all they do is just make Uber Eats orders all day. &gt;&gt; I see. So I mean famously yeah the um the restaurant economy in places like Taipei would have been really good but it&#x27;s gotten worse because people are eating in more with Uber Eats and stuff like that. &gt;&gt; I think so. I think so. As far as the like walking around and just like stuff on No, there&#x27;s still plenty of places. But there are like a number of</p>
<p>restaurants I used to always take in the wall beef noodles or something like oh you can&#x27;t actually go eat there anymore but there are still Uber Eats. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a bummer. It&#x27;s like a separate problem. The the San Francisco problem at restaurants is that nobody drinks anymore and so the restaurants can&#x27;t you know uh they&#x27;ve lost a major. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s so bad you you had to get a your own office. &gt;&gt; Exactly. We&#x27;re trying just firsthand to uh uh to to fix it. &gt;&gt; Be the change you want to see in the world. Should people visit places beyond Taipei or they &gt;&gt; Oh, for sure. Yeah. No, Taipei is great. It&#x27;s great to walk around. Uh, Taipei 101, uh, which is obviously very much in</p>
<p>the news these days with with the the scaling, &gt;&gt; but you can go up the elevator on the &gt;&gt; You go up there because there&#x27;s a massive ball at the top, &gt;&gt; the mass temper. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Which is amazing. It&#x27;s like like I if you&#x27;re into like engineering, uh, that&#x27;s actually a very underrated thing. National Palace Museum is amazing. &gt;&gt; But the whole the East Coast in particular is is incredible. You like you drive there is a train but the driving you can drive like you&#x27;re driving on the coast like &gt;&gt; coast of Hawaii kind of. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Uh the problem there&#x27;s an incredible gorge called Turokco Gorge &gt;&gt; that was really Yeah. messed up by an</p>
<p>earthquake a couple years ago. So I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even reopened yet, but I used to take people to that all the time cuz it&#x27;s it&#x27;s world class. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It is impressive that they said we&#x27;re going to build the tallest skyscraper in the world in like a very frequent earthquake region. So &gt;&gt; yeah, it&#x27;s a big skyscraper. It worked out well for the Netflix. &gt;&gt; Yes. So you&#x27;ve talked a lot over the</p>
<h2>Aggregation and AI</h2>
<p>years about aggregation theory and really popularized this idea where pre-in often power would live with the supply whereas on the internet because of the different you know marginal cost dynamics and things like that. Uh power will rest with the demand aggregators. And so Booking.com is a much bigger company than any hotel chain, you know, something like that. &gt;&gt; And Booking.com is the particularly interesting one because they aggregate all the hotels, but they are also aggregated by Google. &gt;&gt; So they&#x27;re like Google&#x27;s biggest</p>
<p>customer even as they&#x27;re also on the other side. &gt;&gt; I feel like Booking.com is a very underappreciated success story in tech. you know, they&#x27;re a European company, kind of much quieter in a lot of ways, but like if you invested a dollar in Booking.com and a dollar in Google 20 years ago, you made much more money as a Booking.com shareholder. And I think people don&#x27;t uh appreciate that fact. It&#x27;s a very well-run business. &gt;&gt; Um, but where I was going with this is how does aggregation theory apply to AI? How does one need to update the framework? TBD to a certain extent. I mean this is part of the huge probably</p>
<p>the the the one of the most angsty debates that I have internally generally which is open AAI&#x27;s sort of welfare going forward. I put forward a few years ago that actually OpenAI could stop making models and be one of the most valuable companies in the world just because of chat GPT. That&#x27;s their most that&#x27;s their most valuable asset. And part of the problem issue that they have is that was definitely the case in 2023 and 2024. Um, but they never, you have to actually build the business model around that.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ve, you know, I think fairly famously, at least based on all the tweets that I got when they announced that they&#x27;re going to launch ads, I&#x27;ve been losing my mind about this fact for a long time. And I think this is interesting. I&#x27;d actually be curious your view of this, which is there&#x27;s this mindset in the valley of this skepticism of advertising and people have sort of like internalized that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s bad and evil. Do do you do you sense that? Do you feel that? &gt;&gt; I agree. There&#x27;s kind of a knee-jerk skepticism of ads and like look, you know, when I I&#x27;m a YouTube Premium</p>
<p>subscriber. When I see someone uh you know, uh watch a video without premium gas. It&#x27;s like what are you what are you doing with your life? And so like I get the knee-jerk reaction and at Stripe at some level as kind of the the anti-advertising company and like we&#x27;re the opposite uh uh form of monetization, but I don&#x27;t know. I have no particular um issue. I think it&#x27;s like a very efficient form of monetization. It makes a lot of sense for certain products. Um and so I think it&#x27;s just different strokes for you&#x27;re I think you&#x27;re with Stripe.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re you&#x27;re on the you&#x27;re on the skepticism side. I think ads are amazing and uh and you know I&#x27;m talking my book a little bit. Trae trajectory has gotten tremendous traction just by not hating ads even though I&#x27;m not an ad model myself. &gt;&gt; Exactly. But you&#x27;re a paid model. &gt;&gt; Uh well it&#x27;s actually it&#x27;s funny. I actually think I got a lot of traction over the years by talking about ads when no one else was despite the fact it&#x27;s the most important business model in tech. &gt;&gt; And I look back and all my early writing about ads was terrible. I had no idea what I but I just by virtue of talking about it was it was helpful. Uh the the reality of advertising is</p>
<p>number one people if you&#x27;re making a product in the world like strategy is very fortunate like it is definitely a new model or a new internet native model in that I have subscribers in like 200 countries right like I&#x27;m literally the whole world is my market uh and Stripe obviously helps helps make that possible &gt;&gt; a few in the Vatican you know they&#x27;re following along with &gt;&gt; I could go check you know I I would put the odds are very high that I do have at least one one subscriber to the Vatican. Um, and but where I benefited from is I was a massive beneficiary of social</p>
<p>media, particularly Twitter. &gt;&gt; And that back in the early days, good days of Twitter, if you want to say whatever it was, uh, there was currency in sharing smart links. &gt;&gt; And so if I was a regular provider of links that people felt made them smart, so they would share them and talk about them and be sort of back and forth. And so that solved my customer acquisition issue. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh the reality though is most because the other thing about about content actually is a point I issue to come back to &gt;&gt; is it&#x27;s a something to talk about. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s something it&#x27;s commonality sort of</p>
<p>sort of between us that we can both read the same thing. We can both have opinions on it, sort of react to it. the sort of product that I buy on Instagram is not what I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not going to like post about it or talk about it, but it could be tremendously beneficial. And they in theory have this those these small businesses or whatever they might be um or Chinese suppliers or whatever, they have the same opportunity which is sell to everyone in the world. They just need a way to tell people about it. As someone who buys way too many products off of Instagram, and by the way, one of</p>
<p>the great things about moving back to the US &gt;&gt; is the Instagram ads are unbelievable. Like, I thought they were pretty good in Taiwan. They&#x27;re so much better in the US. Like, oh, this is the best part of living in the richest country in the world. &gt;&gt; Advertising. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s amazing. Like, I&#x27;m like, what what&#x27;s this native content? Give me more ads. Um, which by the way, Facebook is very happy to do over the last 6 months. Um, lots of ads these days. But, uh, I get stuff that I never would have thought of. I didn&#x27;t even know about. And it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s amazing and it&#x27;s a real benefit to me as a consumer who subscribes who for sure subscribes to YouTube premium and looks down on people</p>
<p>who don&#x27;t but finding things that I didn&#x27;t know about that make my life better. So, as a user, I&#x27;m benefiting. As a rich user, I&#x27;m benefiting. As the world is six billion people, most of whom do not have the disposable income that I have, much less you have, much less anyone else in San Francisco has, they get the same experience I do. and something for AI like when you think about particularly when it&#x27;s so costly to provide and the free product is so much worse than the paid product &gt;&gt; of course it&#x27;s a win for them to be able</p>
<p>to get access like so to have a mission of believe that AI makes the world better &gt;&gt; and to not embrace ads no I I agree with ads being an efficient form of monetization what do you think is the right way for consumer AI apps to do ads like uh you know chat just announced that they&#x27;re doing ads and they&#x27;re doing well. No, they&#x27;re doing them as the very separate experience to the answer. &gt;&gt; No, this is why it&#x27;s so bad. This is why I&#x27;m so frustrated with them. So, what they&#x27;re doing is the bare minimum easiest solution &gt;&gt; like banner ads basically. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s banner ads, but it&#x27;s based on the</p>
<p>context of the conversation. &gt;&gt; And the problem is that like they release like their ad principles, right? Which is our ads do not influence your answer. If you&#x27;re using the easiest possible way to target ads, which is based on the context of the conversation, we&#x27;re going to show you a roughly relevant ad. Number one, your market&#x27;s way smaller because you have to hope someone starts a conversation that matches the inventory you have. Number two, you&#x27;re getting into a my t-shirt answers questions that my t-shirt is raising sort of situation where if the ad is clearly connected to the answer, you&#x27;re going to raise suspicion in the</p>
<p>users&#x27;s minds about about what sort of the connection is. So I I would prefer if the ads had nothing to do with the answer. The way you get there is you build a meta style understanding of the user and show them stuff that&#x27;s relevant to them. Like in Instagram, the best Instagram ads don&#x27;t have anything to do with the stuff I&#x27;m surfing. It&#x27;s from Meta&#x27;s understanding me broadly. &gt;&gt; So are you saying that like the AI ads should be more like Facebook ads than Google ads? And you know, right now the focus is on doing targeted ads that are</p>
<p>related to the prompt, whereas instead it should all be profiling the user and who this person is and what their interests are. &gt;&gt; Yes, I think that would be better. It would it would present less conflict of interest, less uncertainty amongst the user, and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a model that I think I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not the world&#x27;s biggest fan of search ads precisely for the reason why they work so well. I think there&#x27;s a lot of confusion between organic, no, they&#x27;re cannibalization. Like why is it that I have to buy my own name in search ads, right? because someone else will like go go in there and you&#x27;re getting a harvesting a click on the ad that would have been there sort of organically which is fine it</p>
<p>works the search is providing a lot of value but the the the challenge obviously is they only have one space for inventory which is in chat GPT well sorry is the defense of Google ads that um everyone complains about the branded search and yeah you&#x27;re paying for cannibalization but Google pays so much attention to search quality that the sponsored listings themselves have a uh a ranking of them, like a relevance ranking of them. And so it&#x27;s really just like the yellow pages where, you know,</p>
<p>you need to pay to be listed in the yellow pages. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s fine. I I I I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not I don&#x27;t again I&#x27;m the ad lover here. Uh I just think that meta ads are more broadly valuable because they&#x27;re showing me stuff I didn&#x27;t know that I wanted. &gt;&gt; But if the AI apps are to generate a profile of you, does that profile include the content of all your conversations? This is the thing. Isn&#x27;t that the same? &gt;&gt; So, this is the thing. So, Deus is out there saying, &quot;Wow, I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re adding ads. We&#x27;re not going to do that.&quot; Which is hilarious because the entire Gemini Deep Mine apparatus, what is it funded by?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah. It&#x27;s a Google ad machine. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s funded by ads. And that actually is probably the ideal model. So, it&#x27;s actually very funny. I was actually in New York City last year. Um, I was meeting actually I was meeting with someone in the office in in the shared office or across the hallway was like a was a hedge fund or someone and they came over and he&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, long time reader. Um, you&#x27;re responsible for our worst decision ever.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, &quot;What?&quot; He&#x27;s like, &quot;Putting money in Twitter.&quot; I&#x27;m like, &quot;I&#x27;ve never said to put money in Twitter.&quot; Like, that&#x27;s always been a terrible company. Like, I I stopped covering them because it was</p>
<p>such a bad business. And uh, and I&#x27;m like, &quot;Oh, no. I remember what it was. It was when they bought Mopub.&quot; And my theory, my problem with Twitter advertising has always been that it especially was very textual. I think text doesn&#x27;t work as this a problem for the all this applies to the chat clients. Text isn&#x27;t the best interface for ads. Obviously, visuals are are generally better. And there&#x27;s also a posture. &gt;&gt; If I&#x27;m on Twitter, I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m ready to do battle. I&#x27;m locked in. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m searching for information. If I&#x27;m on Instagram, the whole point of like seeing an ad is I don&#x27;t really care what I&#x27;m seeing right now. I&#x27;m wasting time.</p>
<p>you&#x27;re actually in a much better posture I think to absorb just like TV like you&#x27;re sort of absorbing can absorb the ad &gt;&gt; and Twitter is like bad for that. So but but Twitter because it&#x27;s an interest based network at least in theory it should be able to understand a lot about you above and beyond theoretically having pixels and and SDKs sort of all over the web. And so my theory with the MOPub acquisition I thought it was a great acquisition &gt;&gt; because like oh they can harness signal from Twitter and manifest it in other apps through this sort of Mopub Mopub network. Now Twitter was incompetent so</p>
<p>they did nothing with Mopub gave it to Apple who&#x27;s now written Mopub to like like the top of the world &gt;&gt; but that was sort of my thesis and I think that could apply to to AI as well. I think the ideal outcome for Google is they never put ads in Gemini, but they understand so much about you because of what you do in Gemini that they can then manifest that through ads on YouTube, through ads on Google, through ads on their other properties. And the challenge for Open Eye is they only have one place to put inventory which is which is in JPT. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you&#x27;re saying that Google</p>
<p>could use uh Gemini to just improve the targeting of the ads across the Google properties and then maybe if you want to have ads in Gemini, uh &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think you need to ever put ads in Gemini, &gt;&gt; but but just if you did, you would also have the profile that Google has for sure &gt;&gt; of you from across the web and you could &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you don&#x27;t need to have ads that are like making the user feel weird because why are you showing the ads about what I&#x27;m asking about? &gt;&gt; Okay. But in the scenario you&#x27;re just describing for Google, wouldn&#x27;t that have the same just like the, you know, meta is listen to your microphone conspiracy theories where when the targeting is too good, people get</p>
<p>concerned like wouldn&#x27;t you get similar issues? &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s a madeup concern. &gt;&gt; No, it is. But sure, but like people people have it and wouldn&#x27;t you have a similar issue where if you&#x27;re using the Gemini data to make better ads, won&#x27;t ultimately the targeting be too good and people will find it weird? I mean, I think that that&#x27;s a bridge that every tech company would be happy to cross if they came to it. &gt;&gt; I see. It&#x27;s a thing that people say when you have very good target. &gt;&gt; I think there&#x27;s a lot of like I honestly I think a lot of the the there&#x27;s a real stated versus revealed preference about a lot of this stuff. The reality is is</p>
<p>people like even the US think oh you could pay for Facebook or you could show people would rather see the ads. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think most people don&#x27;t care in this &gt;&gt; a lot of tech and this sort of ties into the skepticism of ads. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s sort of an elite town. There&#x27;s a wheat regulators. Everyone&#x27;s thinking about these very theoretical things. &gt;&gt; Isn&#x27;t it a bit of the challenge banner blindness where Instagram advertising works so well because it&#x27;s a picture feed and it&#x27;s showing you pictures. &gt;&gt; I think some of the pictures are like commercials. &gt;&gt; So this is where Facebook &gt;&gt; with an AI app you&#x27;re like looking for</p>
<p>an answer and you don&#x27;t want to look at the banner. No, it&#x27;s a huge concern and this is one of the great ironies of MetaF Facebook is the extent to which they of course Mark and everyone hates Apple for lots of I think very justifiable reasons but Apple saved Facebook from itself like back in the day remember Facebook platform and there&#x27;s like Facebook payments and all this sort of thing and Mark has always wanted to build a platform and if you&#x27;re just an app on a own. You can&#x27;t build a platform. And the</p>
<p>problem is that I think being an advertising based model is generally incompatible with being a platform. The whole point of a platform is you&#x27;re letting something else shine, something else bring to the surface. You&#x27;re just un you&#x27;re you&#x27;re the support structure for something to take over. So an operating system is not about the ideally it&#x27;s the application on top of it that that you&#x27;re using. When Facebook was forced to not be a platform but just be an app, suddenly they could be fully lean into being an advertising thing. And think about a Facebook ad. Even back in the day was a feed ad or a story ad.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Literally your entire device &gt;&gt; is all an ad. &gt;&gt; And somehow it&#x27;s not a banner, it&#x27;s a little thing on the edge. They literally have achieved permission from users &gt;&gt; to take over your entire device to show you a full screen ad &gt;&gt; every 5 seconds. It&#x27;s amazing. Yeah. And they they were forced into it by Apple. &gt;&gt; Do you Okay, this reminds me of and I want to come back to the eye um dynamics, but this reminds me of a view I&#x27;ve had that I&#x27;m curious for your thoughts on, which is often when tech companies become really big, they become</p>
<p>really big just because the core idea works better than even the founders could have realized. And so Meta is a really uh big company because they uh have a feed and the feed got really big and they like were very smart along the way where they bought Instagram and they&#x27;re like incredibly targeted good monetization but it turns out people spent a lot of time and many people you know the P times Q of that with the feed and they monetized it very well and that&#x27;s what got really big and same with Nvidia. It just turns out that the GPU market got really big and they</p>
<p>sell a lot of GPUs and so maybe founders because they&#x27;re often like high-powered individuals who want to have lots of new ideas, they&#x27;re often thinking about the next thing or like what the second act or the third act is and everyone wants to in invent AWS. But I&#x27;m curious what you would say to the idea that just &gt;&gt; generally it&#x27;s making the core thing really big and there&#x27;s more orders of magnitude at the top than you thought. Yes, I think that&#x27;s always the case. And I think that sometimes people end up making something that they didn&#x27;t want to make and they continually push back.</p>
<p>I think Meta is the perfect example. I I my impression is Mark&#x27;s not very interested in ads. He&#x27;s had very good people along the way that have helped him build these ad products. I think Meta has suffered from that because he has not been front and center fighting for actually ads are good. They are societal good. They get they are the driver of all the consumer surplus that tech throws off. Like the president uses the same search engine as the guy on the street or the same AI or sort of</p>
<p>whatever it might be. That&#x27;s because of ads and the uh &gt;&gt; probably not. The president probably used like a palunteer search engine or something. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s probably worse. Um Google Google has left a lot to be fair. Um there&#x27;s so much junk online, but the um does Donald Trump ever search? I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s a good question. But uh but he&#x27;s not made that case. And I think Meta has suffered because of the failure to make that case. And then you get things like we&#x27;re going to do the metaverse. We&#x27;re going to do XYZ. It&#x27;s always coming back. We be a platform. Be a platform. And Meta is an entertainment company. I wrote this like years ago</p>
<p>about the like I think this is actually it was simultaneously a good call and a bad call. Do you remember that Paul Krugman quote uh the internet&#x27;s not going to be very big or the fact machine because people don&#x27;t have much interesting to say? &gt;&gt; I actually defend that quote &gt;&gt; and because it&#x27;s actually true. Most people actually don&#x27;t have that much interesting to say. And the I brought up that quote around 2015 by saying this is a fundamental limiter on Meta&#x27;s long-term potential. As long as they think of themselves as a</p>
<p>social media company, they&#x27;re going to run into a problem with their feeds becoming insufficiently interesting over time. Now, &gt;&gt; uh, the move from kind of peer content to, um, &gt;&gt; well, so that was that was a, if I might say so myself, a very brilliant insight. The bad insight was my prescription, which was they needed to do more with professional content makers, like more funding of like the Buzzfeeds of the world and share revenue, all that. &gt;&gt; Userenerated content. &gt;&gt; The actual answer is what Tik Tok did, which is &gt;&gt; Tik Tok is not a social network at all.</p>
<p>It is a &gt;&gt; harvesting and YouTube, you know, the same sort of idea. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like personalized TV. Yeah, &gt;&gt; what actually matters and this is a key thing people get hung up on relative numbers and what matters is absolute numbers. So it is better to have.1% of your content is good if your content is like in the billions or trillions as opposed to oh 10% of our content is good but you only have a 100 pieces of content. That&#x27;s actually worse even if you have a better hit rate. And so spurring lots of creation, writing the algorithms to to capture the good stuff,</p>
<p>put it up there, that actually solves the Paul Groomman fax machine problem. &gt;&gt; And Facebook was blindsided by that. They were so stuck on their identity of being a social network that they let Tik Tok take this huge chunk. It was their blind spot. Speaking of Tik Tok, I feel</p>
<h2>TikTok/Bytedance</h2>
<p>like you don&#x27;t write about Bite Dance that much, and I&#x27;m curious just what your thoughts are on Bite Dance from here and the Tik Tok sale and everything. &gt;&gt; I mean, what a what a what a mess. Uh, I had to make a decision a long time ago. I I wrote about Chinese companies more previously and I think there&#x27;s &gt;&gt; uh it&#x27;s too number one, I have to decide what what I&#x27;m going to be able to cover and what I&#x27;m not. Uh, I&#x27;m not in China. I was in I was in Taiwan. it is a different internet and there was too much sort of uncertainty and unknowns just in general about a lot of Chinese</p>
<p>companies. I would write about them occasionally in the context of US tech companies. So I think I wrote about like WeChat and what it meant for the iPhone&#x27;s relative competitive position in China, how it&#x27;s different than sort of other countries. I think that sort of held up pretty well. Wrote about Tik Tok in the context I mean more about Tik Tok I think uh in the context particularly this context of meta. Um, Tik Tok came up around the same time as the uh was was it Quibby, &gt;&gt; which Quibby was the example of that. Quibby was like it was actually right that there was room for a mobile entertainment product. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was totally wrong about the content acquisition strategy. So even if they</p>
<p>had hit rate was higher, their total volume was way too small. I follow them but not super closely. It&#x27;s just a hard market to understand and the uh &gt;&gt; like Tik Tok&#x27;s very relevant to the US market. So Tik Tok Tik Tok I so I wrote the Tik Tok war basically making the case that the problem with Tik Tok and back then everyone was talking about user data. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Who cares? Like the the whole user data thing people have this view of like the East German Stazzy and like folders like going through people&#x27;s datas like these</p>
<p>are like vector databases with like numbers that no human can parse. like they&#x27;re they&#x27;re it&#x27;s really quite anodine. It&#x27;s just related to target ads and um I was very skeptical about that being a forcing function in terms of forcing divesture or whatever it might be. The issue I had was the algorithm and I noticed I think it was when the Hong Kong protests happened and Daryl my then GM of the Houston Rockets tweeted like free Hong Kong or something like that and</p>
<p>there&#x27;s a huge meltdown the NBA games have canled and I noticed that on Tik Tok and this was from I tested it from Taiwan and via VPN from the US. Uh, if you search for every single NBA team, you got NBA clips. Except for Rockets, you got nothing. &gt;&gt; Oh, that&#x27;s funny. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m like, &gt;&gt; they got demonetized. &gt;&gt; There is there is a thumb on the scale here. And I started talking about it then and my I did support the ban of Tik Tok or the force sort of divesture from China &gt;&gt; because it seems fairly insane to have a primarily information source controlled</p>
<p>by your chief geopolitical adversary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. saying like there&#x27;s rules over TV station ownership and it&#x27;s like not wildly different &gt;&gt; and so I I you know everything&#x27;s a trade-off of course I&#x27;m pretty well known for being a pretty stark defender of free speech and against censorship and my issue wasn&#x27;t Tik Tok per se was &gt;&gt; tech the reality of China is &gt;&gt; the founder of Tik Tok of bite dance is long gone &gt;&gt; because he got called to the carpet for bite dance showing a little too much of what people liked which is mostly like hot girls dancing</p>
<p>and being insufficiently like showing the right things that the party wanted. It&#x27;s in China&#x27;s like the reality is China has the price of doing business is they get you know they&#x27;re on somewhere on the the control structure they can tell you what to do and this just seemed like a very foolish thing to tolerate. Uh unfortunately um the US political process or fortunately maybe the reality is is the US process and system is such a mess. Can anyone really truly impact it over time? Uh the way that it shows</p>
<p>up messily is we somehow do pass the law banning Tik Tok and it didn&#x27;t get banned and now it is sold but China still controls the algorithm. So I think it&#x27;s a big disaster. It&#x27;s also like what what can I say about it? I said my piece. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, we ended up in the worst possible case, which is we violated property rights and we did all this stuff that&#x27;s ridiculous and we probably bartered XYZ for ABC and we didn&#x27;t get the most important thing which is control the algorithm. &gt;&gt; Has that not happened as part of the sale? &gt;&gt; No, back then still controls the algorithm. &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t know that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good job by us. &gt;&gt; That does seem like it was the point of the spin out. &gt;&gt; Well, the data was always the was always the most uh salient political point. And so when I wrote about it, that was my point. like I don&#x27;t care about the data. The issue is the algorithm &gt;&gt; and um unfortunately that did not care. Maybe I should have wrote about more but anything like all the politics stuff there was a period &gt;&gt; I mean thank god for AI there was a period I wrote like when I wrote aggregation theory a couple weeks later I wrote like something about regulation. I&#x27;m like this is going to drive a bunch of regulatory issues and antitrust things and and all these bits and</p>
<p>pieces. when that actually happened, the late end of the last decade. Of course, I was writing about it. I was watching congressional hearings, all sort of thing. And that is the close I came to quitting and burning out. &gt;&gt; I think burnout&#x27;s not a function of how much work you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s doing work you don&#x27;t enjoy. &gt;&gt; And at one point, I&#x27;m like, either I quit or I stop covering congressional hearings. &gt;&gt; So, I decided to stop covering congressional hearings. Uh, I only wrote about antitrust stuff was super prominent and I&#x27;ve been much happier ever since. And maybe that&#x27;s part of the price of just not writing about that is</p>
<p>maybe I should have pushed on the Tik Tok thing more. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s interesting. &gt;&gt; I said my piece. So &gt;&gt; yeah. Is strategy very widely read in DC? &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, it is. Uh sometimes it&#x27;s gratifying. Uh it&#x27;s great when you get called and asked for your opinion. Um or you know you get certain responses or you see impact. It&#x27;s less gratifying when you get yelled at and people are are mad at you. But fortunately, the key thing to succeeding on the internet is something I have in spades, which is a very high level of disagreeableness. So,</p>
<p>you can yell me all you want. I&#x27;m not going to change my mind. &gt;&gt; Okay. But getting back to aggregation</p>
<h2>Aggregation and AI redux</h2>
<p>theory as it pertains to AI. Like a simplistic view you could have is that the AI apps are the new aggregators and so a huge amount of economic value will acrue to them and that&#x27;s it. You could also say that that&#x27;s too simplistic in a bunch of ways because one of like we&#x27;re saying the you know booking.com you expect it to return you hotels that you should book uh but you expect a little less of a commercial incentive from the AI apps and this is like a little more of an abstract technology where it&#x27;s actually not trivial to insert all of</p>
<p>the you know commercial uh incentives in the right way and any you come up with various objections and so do you &gt;&gt; well I think the ad model is is is probably the way to start &gt;&gt; which is I just talked about before sort of the lean in versus lean back. ads are very tied into human psychology and like what you&#x27;re sort of tapping into and people&#x27;s response to that and how do you make something creative and in the short term &gt;&gt; you know technology often makes old business models even more powerful &gt;&gt; before it kills them &gt;&gt; right so you have something like uh you know suddenly you&#x27;re a newspaper I used</p>
<p>to be limited to my geographic area right &gt;&gt; now I can reach the whole world &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; oh wait a few years later everyone can reach the whole world yes &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m in pure competition I&#x27;m screwed. And that is certainly a concern about this model. If you get to a world of say agent commerce and the agents are just buying the right thing like and this is I think this is also something that has driven a lot of tech skepticism of ads. &gt;&gt; People in tech tend to be fairly nerdy, fairly obsessed. Uh they&#x27;re doing a ton of research to find sort of the exact</p>
<p>right thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. Why would anyone tell me what to buy when I&#x27;ve, you know, researched it for two hours? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But and so like ads have no effect on me. Well, what if that sort of obsessive deep dive approach is now trivally available to everyone because AI is the one actually doing it? &gt;&gt; Now where where do ads sort of function? And I think this is definitely a bit of a be careful what you wish for scenario &gt;&gt; because what this entails is of course more transparency,</p>
<p>more details, more understanding sounds good. What it actually entails is sort of perfect competition which is a very sort of brutal game that can just wipe out entire categories. That&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s basically what happened to newspapers uh in many respects. So that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s number one. Number two, in a world of this sort of world, you&#x27;re sort of by definition anchoring on whatever specifications or whatever can be measured, can be put down. And you had the old sort of Steve Jobs adage about feeds and speeds versus</p>
<p>like the feel of something where the intersection of liver what the what the does that mean? And it&#x27;s just like well uh what it actually means is there&#x27;s things that can&#x27;t be measured and that don&#x27;t go on an Excel spreadsheet and everyone you talk to acknowledges this say yes there&#x27;s things that can&#x27;t be measured and the way it actually plays out in practice is only the things that measured sort of matter. I think this has happened to a this a huge problem with sports analytics is a great example of this where there I think basketball is my favorite sport. There&#x27;s a lot that goes into basketball and winning that is somewhat hard to wrap your hands around.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Like baseball&#x27;s very measurable. I do think there&#x27;s aspects about clutchness and stuff that I&#x27;m I&#x27;m that I don&#x27;t know that are properly measured. But around basketball for sure, the interaction and way teams play together and how your effort on or your involvement on offense can affect defense or sort of back and forth and and you see again and again like to take my you know I like Daryl my um I think there&#x27;s a reason his teams haven&#x27;t won. they&#x27;ve overoptimized at the expense of some of these these other issues and if you can&#x27;t measure them they tend to</p>
<p>get devalued and in a world of AI mediated everything how many things that can&#x27;t get measured fall by the wayside because we end up with it&#x27;s very utilitarian sort of goods that have no soul to them. um sort of a silly sort of thing to worry about in some respects. It&#x27;s like or it sounds silly, but I&#x27;m a human and I anticipate liking and preferring the humanity of things of all sorts in the long run. But you could say</p>
<p>that um like e-commerce aggregators like Amazon and lots of others have led to you know fairly anonymous manufacturers of lots of everyday goods uh the kind of Amazon basics type stuff and a much lower price point than they you know were at previously at still perfectly good quality. Isn&#x27;t that Isn&#x27;t that fine? This is where you throw my ad argument in my face, which is like actually it brings up the base level for everyone.</p>
<p>Like your basic consumer, the access of items they have to in the like &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s no soul in an Amazon basics and that&#x27;s fine. &gt;&gt; Everyone thinks back to like, oh, my washing machine was so much better in the 1960s. And it&#x27;s like, yes, that&#x27;s true. And also far fewer people had wash machines. &gt;&gt; And so I&#x27;m now like making the opposite argument sort of I will leave and you can have a one person. &gt;&gt; Switch back and forth. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. You can change sides of the booth. Um you mentioned agent</p>
<h2>Agentic commerce</h2>
<p>commerce where you know we obviously are are big into that and had our announcement uh with OpenAI um uh back in October. Where do you think that goes? Like how do you see agent commerce playing out? &gt;&gt; I mean the the contrast between uh your own open announcement and sort of Google&#x27;s announcement I think is is pretty interesting and speaks to what the companies are driving for. Openai wants to be the place you do everything. They want to be like the aggregator. I think a critic would say people compare them to Netscape. I think the better analogy if you&#x27;re an open AI skeptic would be AOL uh where they want to be</p>
<p>sort of like the interface for everything that you might do and it goes through their channels and Google just as they were relative to AOL is like actually we want to we want to make equip everyone knowing that if everyone is capable we are the greatest beneficiaries because we still marshall sort of the the sort of front-end demand sort of in that regard. Now, how does that actually manifest in terms of commerce? The funny thing about tech is I don&#x27;t think it will manifest in terms of uh airplane tickets, which is everyone&#x27;s example like everyone can</p>
<p>never think of a better example than that. Uh but what what is the AI going to buy? What is it going to get? I don&#x27;t know. I think I would like to think people will want to have agency in their buying decisions. But then again, I you know, we have like assistants whether it be like, you know, for work or whatever it might be and they make buying decisions that we&#x27;re necessarily not involved in. And that I think is a good predictor precursor of what people will ideally like, do I really need to know? Actually, I have very strong paper towel ideas. That was going to be my that was</p>
<p>going to be my but once I once that&#x27;s set, &gt;&gt; can that be sort of monitored and done? Um, so I don&#x27;t know. I think this is a very unsatisfying answer other than to say it has big implications on things like advertising and on things like like is that going to be a viable business model going forward. Uh what margins are going to be available? Is there going to be perfect competition? Things along those lines. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me try this on you for agent of commerce and I&#x27;m curious to have you critique it which is sort of how I see things playing out. I think some skepticism is triggered by people pitching a very</p>
<p>far-end state with a lot of agentic autonomy. And so it&#x27;s like please book me a honeymoon in Japan and all the activities or like no one actually does things that way. Whereas actually you should go from the bottoms up in some very basic building blocks where um step one is just replacing filling out web forms. That&#x27;s an activity that sucks. No one likes it. And so imagine you find the winter jacket you like and you copy the URL into chat GBT and just say please buy this for me. And that&#x27;s a much better experience than going</p>
<p>clicking around a site you&#x27;ve never been to before. And so there&#x27;s just the agents doing kind of tool use on your behalf and everyone can create that. Maybe it clarifies there&#x27;s multiple colors. Which one do you like? Uh but it&#x27;s just replacing filling out form fields. This is by the way one thing that I am very a lot of people are skeptical of this but I I am very optimistic about which is I call like just in time UI &gt;&gt; exactly the the like &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s a better UI. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. Okay. So that&#x27;s like level one is a better UI for for kind of doing an action you want to know. Okay. Then level two is better discovery in search.</p>
<p>It is crazy that we&#x27;ve gotten this far in e-commerce with keyword-based search. like keyword-based search works really well when you&#x27;re buying a book that you know the name of. It&#x27;s like I want to go by this particular title. &gt;&gt; Um for a winter jacket, it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know, I want it&#x27;s like a puffer, like what&#x27;s it called? And so instead, you want to be able to say I&#x27;m looking for a jacket, this kind of I&#x27;m going to this place, it&#x27;s going to be this cold. Uh you know, I like these kinds of things, whatever. And so step two is just better search and the ability to search with parameters that like no</p>
<p>existing search UI lets you specify the temperature of the place you&#x27;re going to actually get you know a jacket of appropriate warmth. But that&#x27;s obviously with a jacket one of the core things and so better search UI is kind of level two from our point of view &gt;&gt; right which I think is already sort of manifesting. &gt;&gt; Exactly. you&#x27;re already and like in the early usage of the kind of chat GBT buying experience I think that&#x27;s one of those like super cool features and then level three which we haven&#x27;t really seen play out yet is this idea again of a persistent profile of the user &gt;&gt; that anticipates their needs &gt;&gt; exactly it&#x27;s like I want to be able to</p>
<p>just pin things I like as I go along or maybe you know if I can share my browser history or maybe if I can just like you know share a Pinterest board of just like these are some styles I like give me a good winter jacket for the cold based on that here are photos of me uh you know based on uh this and so starting &gt;&gt; well I have even better I have even better idea imagine if you were using chat GPT and it&#x27;s circa October 1st and there is an ad for a great winter jacket that is perfectly suited to me because they&#x27;ve been understanding my interests they understand the context of where I</p>
<p>am not searching for winter jackets because I don&#x27;t plan well it&#x27;s going to get cold and then I&#x27;m searching winter jacket I&#x27;m &gt;&gt; but what if it could anticipate that and show me an ad at the right time when I need to see it. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe that&#x27;s level four is like the uh &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been wanting them to build. This is my whole myth before. Like this is like this is why they&#x27;re so late. They they should be shipping that this year. You&#x27;re only shipping that this year if you started your ad product two or three years ago. This is doable today. &gt;&gt; This is what meta ads are. You need to be on more you need to watch more reels. I &gt;&gt; like like just the I&#x27;ve bought more ski equipment this year that I don&#x27;t need</p>
<p>just because it just shows up. I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m moving back to Wisconsin so I I&#x27;m buying stuff for the house. And I get, oh, those ski hangers. I bet those would be great. That sounds very useful. They&#x27;re still in a box. I would actually put them up. But &gt;&gt; yeah, so there&#x27;s a limit to kind of with just um kind of banner ad type experiences to what you can do where I think the search thing is is very powerful. But yeah, I&#x27;m curious what you think of kind of step one just the very act of checking out uh and then or level one, the very act of checking out, level two, better search, and then level three defining your own embedding space of</p>
<p>preferences. No, I I I completely agree with that approach. I just think you underrate the extent to which level three has already been built. &gt;&gt; Actually, one of the thing that that um Mark Zuckerberg said on a couple earnings calls ago that I thought was very astute &gt;&gt; is uh we get hung up on technological definitions for like what is an agent? And he&#x27;s like actually the largest and most successful agent in the world today is Facebook advertising &gt;&gt; which is exactly right. Facebook advertising, people have it in their head that you go and you put in like demographics and your targeting and stuff.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, no, it&#x27;s very autopilot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What you do is you go in and you say, uh, this acquiring a customer for this is worth $10 to me. I&#x27;ll spend up to $10 and they will deliver you a customer for $10. Yes. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;ll their margin will actually increase because they will make sure they deliver it at exactly $10. They can do it for more and they actually make more money. You get exactly what you asked for. Uh it&#x27;s I think the extent to how powerful this already works. They&#x27;re just stuck on the 50% of my ads work don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know which ones. &gt;&gt; No on Facebook &gt;&gt; they all work.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I feel like a bunch of new very big successful companies will be created in AI powered e-commerce. It just feels like a different enough product space. But what what you&#x27;re talking about retailers, merchants or dis or a &gt;&gt; I was talking about discovery and um kind of the demand side though also probably retailers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I certainly think I I think that the the part that I think would be new which is a bit which you maybe talking about is this real anticipatory aspect which is right now what is amazing about to go back to meta ads is</p>
<p>it helps merchants who have a very specialized product find customers that they never would have found otherwise but there is the inverse of I need a very specialized product how do I find what it is which I think you were referring to before &gt;&gt; but to what extent can that not just being in the moment. I need this specific I remember I needed a uh a server a piece for my a rack to mount like this router cuz I had like an extra I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole new thing or whatever. I had this extra router and of course there&#x27;s some guy in Australia that does 3D prints that perfectly matches this on Etsy or something and it</p>
<p>was great. I found this random guy I&#x27;m sure he made a bunch of money selling me a $40 piece that cost him $2 to make. Good for him. Uh but what if an AI should be capable of anticipating that need? &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s not I oh I have a need let me go find it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like I know you&#x27;re going to need this and let me acquire it. And that would be very powerful. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; In his excellent newsletter strategy Ben often argues that whoever controls the customer relationship shapes the entire ecosystem. And in mobile apps, there&#x27;s</p>
<p>always been this interesting tension here with inapp purchases where historically app developers had an intermediated relationship with their customer through app store policies. Over the past year, that layer has started to open up. Mobile developers can choose what they use for inapp payments. Developers now have more freedom. But with that freedom comes new challenges. App Store payments were previously handling a whole bunch of different tasks like payments, tax, fraud, disputes, all bundled together. Stripe manage payments is built for this new world, handling all that operational complexity for you with Stripe as the</p>
<p>merchant of record. And with our new app to web flow, customers can check out in seconds in an experience that feels native. It converts like inapp payments, but it runs on Stripe.</p>
<h2>Is SaaS canceled?</h2>
<p>The public markets indicate as of January 2026 that SAS is canled. Are they right? I think it&#x27;s probably a mix. Uh the I think the one of the brilliance of American business is actually this is one of my theories about why the Europeans are so gung-ho about data privacy and regulation is because they so often interact with European companies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, like I was in Paris a couple years a</p>
<p>couple years ago and of course going on a tourist trip going to going to the Lou going to the museum or wherever it is like or not whatever it was seeing a bunch of museums. &gt;&gt; They all have their own homegrown registration systems &gt;&gt; and they&#x27;re collecting so much data &gt;&gt; and they&#x27;re like it&#x27;s like yeah what&#x27;s your age? What&#x27;s your pet? What color is like it&#x27;s like why do you need to know all this information? They&#x27;re all non-standard forms. they need this is where you need AI to fill all this sort of thing in like what like there&#x27;s like this theoretical idea in their head if we capture this data it could be useful so</p>
<p>they built these homegrown things in like the 2000s that are horribly insecure and I use them I&#x27;m like where&#x27;s the regulator can someone put this is ridiculous so I get I get the mindset &gt;&gt; US companies don&#x27;t do that like US companies are so good I think one of the big strengths of of US business culture is understanding and I think about this personally. This is what I give life advice. What&#x27;s the number one mistake people make uh when they&#x27;re young in particular? They focus on their weaknesses. Like I have to amiliate my weakness. Like no, what you do is you</p>
<p>double down on your strength. You get richly rewarded for that and then you hire someone to take care of your weaknesses, right? Like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a big believer in the getting things done system. Like great book, Getting Things Done. Even if you don&#x27;t use the system, the book is really good. Lots of great insights. There&#x27;s this whole thing like tickler files and like all these sorts of things. It&#x27;s an amazing system. I&#x27;m completely incapable of managing the system on my own. So there&#x27;s a Mac app called Omnif Focus that is completely built around the system that I don&#x27;t have a license for. My assistant has a license for and I text him stuff and his job is to maintain my getting things</p>
<p>done file because I can&#x27;t do it. What I what do I do? Actually my wife is very very optimized around I write three pieces a week. I do an interview and I do three podcasts and all my focus and energy needs to be on that. And if I do that, that will make a lot of money and I can pay to fix all my problems sort of elsewhere. And I think American business does this very well. They don&#x27;t waste time and energy on stuff they&#x27;re not good at. They double down on what they&#x27;re good at and they&#x27;re focused on the upside, not on their cost centers. &gt;&gt; Probably a result of the very large market in the US.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think so. And just the the competition, it would be in a very large uh common market. So you you like you you don&#x27;t have your like you go back to like newspapers, they have lots of homegrown stuff. Like if you&#x27;re a publication on like online, if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re like me on the internet, &gt;&gt; I get paid to comment on the big tech companies. It&#x27;s probably the most competitive market on earth, right? Like lots of people have takes on the big tech companies. Uh and so you have to be super focused given that that speaks to the enduring value of just paying someone to manage these these business functions from a software perspective.</p>
<p>Now, there&#x27;s a lot of SA like there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a lot of SAS applications. Not sure they&#x27;re all sort of strictly necessary and and worth the price. Uh I like to think people talk tech. I would say there&#x27;s a big six. &gt;&gt; The six was Silicon Valley Inc. which is basically this cookie cutter &gt;&gt; VC goes to this founder addressing this specific business case with the SAS business model. Everyone likes to they get to talk about changing the world. It&#x27;s actually the most predictable thing yet. That&#x27;s why VC returns compressed, but because they&#x27;re also very predictable in terms of like the sort of</p>
<p>engine going. &gt;&gt; A big problem there is they&#x27;re all seat based. Like anyone&#x27;s seat based that some of that just there&#x27;s going to be probably fewer seats. Uh and then if the replacement is more smallcale, uh ideally there&#x27;s lots of, you know, the internet in general has writing or content is a good example. There used to be sort of you want to be in the big pond and everyone in the big pond sort of ate. If you if you had a job at Kday Nast and one of their magazines, like you lived life well, even if you wrote like four four</p>
<p>magazines today, if you want to be a writer, I give advice to people that that want to be content producers all the time. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m like, look, you don&#x27;t want to be you don&#x27;t want to be in a pond with me, right? Uh Bill Simmons is like the like first internet sports writer and you don&#x27;t want to be doing a Bill Simmons impression on the internet because he got there first. And what what you want to do is you want to make your own pond. The internet enables the creation of a million different ponds. So you to get to define your own pond, be the only biggest fish in that pond. That&#x27;s how you succeed. To the extent AI makes that I think this</p>
<p>is the upside case is AI makes that possible for more than just content for all sorts of businesses to be lots of smaller scale individual entrepreneurs or small teams all of whom don&#x27;t really fit in the Salesforce driven seatbased model for a lot of these companies. So there might be a big return to self-s serve um you know the uh or maybe they&#x27;ll just roll their own because their their needs aren&#x27;t that large. &gt;&gt; Um so that&#x27;s more a larger structural change but the problem is it&#x27;s fine to say</p>
<p>businesses will be okay as they are. If you&#x27;re eliminating the growth that&#x27;s the big problem I think that that&#x27;s the biggest issue for all the compression &gt;&gt; by headcount growth &gt;&gt; just growth in general. like what&#x27;s if if these are just stable businesses with astronomical stockbased compensation &gt;&gt; that is predicated on we&#x27;re going to be very large &gt;&gt; I can see two critiques you might have uh of uh kind of the software space and why everything&#x27;s traded down one is we&#x27;re you know everyone&#x27;s just going to use cloud code to rebuild their own</p>
<p>version in house and so uh the software mode is less and the second is actually just that many of these products price on a per seat basis and so if you&#x27;re growing Headcount less on the first shrinking. Exactly. Yeah. On the first like anthropic just installed workday famously. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So I don&#x27;t think um I don&#x27;t think uh you know we&#x27;re cla &gt;&gt; systems of record are are are is that that&#x27;s the category. &gt;&gt; People do not seem to be um you know we see this with tribul as well like I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s cla coding one of those systems of record anytime soon. Now we use workday. I don&#x27;t know what to</p>
<p>make of the second criticism, but again, it just feels like for a very broad and deep system of record, it&#x27;s kind of hard to make the argument that the business is somehow impaired versus a year or two ago, &gt;&gt; right? But but I think but I think that that&#x27;s my point though is people saying they&#x27;re going to zero are wrong. But if the assumption is you&#x27;re fine &gt;&gt; Mhm. But you&#x27;re not going to be growing indefinitely. Like that shift from thought of as being a growth company to being a stable &gt;&gt; I see</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; that&#x27;s a haircut and again it&#x27;s combined with these whole compensation structures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You&#x27;re now valued on EPS rather than revenue or something. So yeah. Um</p>
<h2>Stratechery</h2>
<p>can we talk about your business and check? &gt;&gt; Sure. So you were very early to the I mean the sovereign writer um concept. Uh I think you were one of the first premium newsletters. &gt;&gt; Uh I think so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well well so there&#x27;s two predecessors to talk about. One is just on Wall Street in general. There&#x27;s a long history of faxed out newsletters and things on like grants. &gt;&gt; Uh the difference there is those were very expensive and a very small addressable market. So, uh, the</p>
<p>difference for Shaki is it&#x27;s much cheaper and the market&#x27;s much larger. &gt;&gt; Uh, the other person that deserves a call out, which I think was the first person to do it before me. Otherwise, I think I was the first, &gt;&gt; was Andrew Sullivan, who did uh &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t realize he had a paid news. &gt;&gt; He did for like a year. &gt;&gt; The problem is he did it all wrong. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re doing it wrong. &gt;&gt; Uh, he was like he would turn out like 50 posts a day, right? just about a gazillion different things. He totally burned out and like all this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But um that was happened to be a great fit for the advertising model back in the day cuz you would always go back there just always be new stuff and I&#x27;m sure he had a gazill I&#x27;m sure he drove a gazillion impressions for the Atlantic especially when he was with them. He went independent. He was pretty successful. I think he he did like around a million dollars or something like that. But it was a this very leaky pay wall. It&#x27;s like after like 35 posts then you&#x27;ll hit like a payw wall and there&#x27;s a bit where you&#x27;re like you&#x27;re punishing your your worst users. It&#x27;s very easy to get around. Um, and so, but he was actually very inspirational in how I thought about the model in that he was hailed as a failure because he like</p>
<p>burnt out and then quit. But I&#x27;m like, he made a million dollars, right? It&#x27;s pretty good. Uh, I wanted from the and just think about the psychology of this. When I started Trajectory, he had a gazillion ideas of things to write about and I limited myself to writing a max of two times a week. And the reason is I had the subscription model in mind and when I added the model I didn&#x27;t want it to be I&#x27;m taking stuff away and now you have to pay. I&#x27;m like you like this so much if you pay you can get more and so I always wanted to be you&#x27;re paying to</p>
<p>get more sort of sort of aspect &gt;&gt; and I think that probably mattered more at the beginning especially because the model was new. Uh, you know, I had I had my metric I looked at was people who visited Shakri on days I didn&#x27;t post &gt;&gt; because they were people that were going there hoping I had posted that day and they were leaving disappointed. &gt;&gt; And so in this case, usually previously a payw wall would disappoint people that they hit it. &gt;&gt; In this case, the payw wall would &gt;&gt; leave their disappointment cuz they they they could now get what they wanted. And so I&#x27;m like, if I can capture X percentage of these visitors, it&#x27;ll be</p>
<p>very good. um one day goal, one week goal, one month goal, failed to reach all of them. Uh what happened was I I I actually thought it was not going to work. I was going to have to go back to like teaching English or something like that. Uh the but it sort of grew and grew and grew and at 6 months actually hit my one year goal which was 1,000 subscribers, thousand true fans, you know, was $100,000 run rate and I posted a little &gt;&gt; take you how long to get to a thousand subs? &gt;&gt; Six months. &gt;&gt; Okay. And I posted a little note saying, &quot;Hey, you know, model works. Reach, you know, my goal is a thousand for a year.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve already reached it.&quot; And this is the only step change in subscribers I&#x27;ve ever had. In the next 24 hours, I got 250 new subscribers. 25% increase. What they were was I had identified those people who wanted to be subscribers. They just didn&#x27;t trust that it was going to work. I was going to go out of business and take their money. And so once they realized I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, then they all they all signed up. And those people signed. So I actually had my my metrics were right, but I didn&#x27;t properly calculate the uncertainty and people&#x27;s fear of</p>
<p>losing their money. Uh so I&#x27;m very grateful that now people just sign up for stuff all the time, right? Uh you know, &gt;&gt; I of course I&#x27;ll probably, you know, go to my grade being most wellknown for Shakery, but I am equally proud of the model and that lots of people make a living doing this. How far do you think this model can go? Like again it the the defining characteristic to me seems like the unbundling like you know maybe 30 years ago you would have been writing for a publication whereas now it&#x27;s unbundling. It&#x27;s the direct relationship with your subscribers. It&#x27;s direct</p>
<p>monetization and generally paid. I mean there might be some ad supporting component as well paid. Obviously, kind of Substack has proven that this is a very broad applicability, but how far do you think this goes versus traditional media bundling &gt;&gt; there? I think there&#x27;s a couple interesting angles to this. Uh number one, I think people including people in tech seriously underrate how large the internet is. And like some of the biggest push back I got when I announced like the check your paid product was from &gt;&gt; VCs. I won&#x27;t say who. It&#x27;s like love you Ben &gt;&gt; just doesn&#x27;t not going to work on the</p>
<p>internet. Um the uh so and my bit about ponds before I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ve scratched the limit of how many ponds &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; can be sort of built in the world and you can sort of occupy and and the other part of this the critical piece of this and AI is actually an important factor here is the key to the model is your costs. So you need just as technology enables you to reach everyone you need to leverage technology to keep your costs very very low. And so for the first several years, for sure it was</p>
<p>just me. So as long as I could feed my family, &gt;&gt; I was I I I was fine. And this is this is the problem for the traditional like media companies. Their cost structures were were not internet cost structures. They were they were predicated on on much higher revenue. And there, you know, and this is it&#x27;s interesting to think about and talk about this because a lot of this it is like not really applicable. It&#x27;s like before I write about ads a lot and I&#x27;m not an ad business. In this case, I write about VC highcalable companies, but my actual business is very sort of boutique and</p>
<p>small and artisan in that. Yeah, that&#x27;s right. In that regard, and this is a super important point is managing your costs. &gt;&gt; If you manage your costs appropriately, then the possibilities, but that also means there&#x27;s some things that don&#x27;t work with this model. &gt;&gt; Like your traditional &gt;&gt; classic investigative journalism six-month sort of piece. Yeah. it it did it&#x27;s not well supported by this. &gt;&gt; What did support that was the bundle &gt;&gt; having lots of different writers in one publication altogether and the thing I worry about I wonder</p>
<p>about is bundles are good for everyone involved and no one wants to be a part of it. So TV is the classic example. Why did we have a TV bundle? Because you had like so in I think it started in Pennsylvania. So you have like a television station in Philadelphia and you have the Alagany Mountains and you have a bunch of towns there that want to get the signal from Philadelphia but they can&#x27;t get a good signal. So they band together. They put up a big tower to get the signal. They run actual cable from that tower to all their houses. And all of cable television started in small</p>
<p>town rural America to get TV from the big cities. And Ted Turner comes along like I could just broadcast directly to these towers. this would be amazing and you get the model and suddenly every but you had a for geographic forcing function and you ended up with all these companies with the best business model in the world. They everyone paid them whether they watched you or not and they made a ton of money &gt;&gt; and what happened the moment they could do something different. &gt;&gt; Let me I could also go directly I could I could stream directly and there&#x27;s just something about business and like cuz it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s almost like you have to</p>
<p>be forced into the game the optimal game &gt;&gt; from like a game theory perspective and the moment you can desert everyone always desserts even if it&#x27;s the best thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I so I wonder so I do wonder can bundles &gt;&gt; how does this apply yeah to your world &gt;&gt; because in theory there should be bundles. Substack should be a bundle. Uh like you should be able to pay one fee and get everything. But they you know they started I think a mistake Substack made and I&#x27;m a huge Substack fan just to be clear. I made this creep before mad about it, but is they characterize themselves as being totally writer</p>
<p>friendly. &gt;&gt; And I think that was a mistake cuz it&#x27;s impossible for them to be ultimately writer friendly cuz the most writer friendly setup is running an open source software like on your own server like then no one could do anything to you. And uh by definition &gt;&gt; I thought you were going to say like the most writer friendly thing is to have like a humming consumer business. It would be but the problem is so they they all their initial terms let &gt;&gt; made the bundles impossible and all the individual publishers owning their own subscribers having their own Stripe account and all these sorts of bits and pieces. &gt;&gt; But hang on isn&#x27;t there like a I feel like there&#x27;s a welltrodden path in tech here where open table started as like</p>
<p>entirely it started as onrem purely software for restaurants and then they added the customer discovery layer on top of it. Shopify started as a solution just for merchants and then they added the shop pay kind of network layer for consumers on top of this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But what what actually ma even with those business though like the shop pay bit is nice. It&#x27;s not the driver of the business. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a pretty cool part of the business. I like it but it&#x27;s but at the end of the day the vast majority of shop interactions are I see an ad on Instagram and I go there and I get shop the shop button which is incredible</p>
<p>things. &gt;&gt; No. Yeah. But then it makes the Shopify offering to merchants so much more compelling because you get the shop pay network and there&#x27;s &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m skeptical that&#x27;s the driver of the business. I think it&#x27;s a nice to have. I think the &gt;&gt; but can&#x27;t Substack just add a Substack Prime bundle on top of it and merchants can or writers can choose &gt;&gt; the problem is yeah the problem is the merchants who will drive make that bundle valuable have no incentive to join the bundle because they could make more just monetizing users directly. So imagine I&#x27;m on Substack. How much more revenue does Substack have to give me</p>
<p>for me to trade $15 a month from all my subscribers for a smaller amount from all whoever is part of this this so the problem is they have to really pay me off to be a part of it meanwhile everyone who doesn&#x27;t have any subscribers of course they love to be in the bundle so so this is why the geographic forces &gt;&gt; feel solvable to me &gt;&gt; I I think it&#x27;s solvable at the beginning &gt;&gt; no sorry it feels solvable now &gt;&gt; yeah I think a counter example is something like Spotify. Spotify is arguably the best bundle on the internet. But the reason why they were able to assemble the bundle is because</p>
<p>they only need to negotiate with like four four entities. &gt;&gt; And so it&#x27;s interesting because on one hand that limits Spotify&#x27;s upside because those entities are able to &gt;&gt; negotiate such a large share of Spotify&#x27;s revenue. On the other hand, that&#x27;s also why Spotify was possible because they only need to negotiate with four. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And if you&#x27;re trying to to like get every artist on earth &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; where you Well, of course I got to get Taylor Swift. Okay, good luck with that. Oh, all the small fry will sign up. But and the music&#x27;s unique in particular because you music the moment a song</p>
<p>comes out &gt;&gt; is now part of the back catalog. It actually people only ever listen to back cataloges. Uh so that it&#x27;s a particularly unique industry in that regard. But that is a bundle that formed. But I think it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s only four players. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Okay. And how do you use AI in</p>
<h2>How Ben uses AI</h2>
<p>writing strategy these days? &gt;&gt; I think it probably replaces what I used to do a lot of on it&#x27;s much more efficient Googling like so I really um the most gratifying articles I write is when I write about a topic that I usually don&#x27;t and then someone from that industry is like wow I did that&#x27;s that was good cuz you&#x27;re always working &gt;&gt; you have this imposter syndrome. Oh, I mean fortunately I don&#x27;t really have imposter syndrome but like if you all work what&#x27;s the uh what&#x27;s the mechanism where you&#x27;re reading something about</p>
<p>your air yeah that&#x27;s right it&#x27;s like this is totally wrong and then you trust everything else uh I am yeah I don&#x27;t want to trigger gum&#x27;s uh amnesia amongst anyone so &gt;&gt; I will and people ask me like I hate the book question like what books do you read &gt;&gt; I read a lot of books but they&#x27;re very targeted like I will I&#x27;m a very very fast reader so sometimes I&#x27;ll write an article I know there&#x27;s a pertinent book and I will just read the whole book in the morning and like really context in there. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; and but but in general I really want to make sure I fully understand a space it&#x27;s new that I&#x27;m writing about. This is</p>
<p>partly though why I have a big competitive advantage. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been thinking about tech since I was in junior high school and I&#x27;ve been writing about tech for 13 years. Yes. &gt;&gt; So I&#x27;ve already done so much preparatory work that anyone starting from scratch it&#x27;s like uh it&#x27;s hard but something so I want to dive into it. I&#x27;m one of the world&#x27;s greatest Googlers. I&#x27;d like to think I know every sort of parameter and how to find and it and so I think I can say pretty authoritarily Google has gotten worse. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Google&#x27;s fault. I just think they just it&#x27;s harder. One thing is Google&#x27;s fault is they got so biased towards recency</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; and so you have to be super like diligent. But um AI is so incredible for this like just sort of getting background making sure you understand an issue the ins and outs of it um how things work. you can query stuff, dive deeper. So that is by far my number one use case. I do not always but I will sometimes ask it to this is where I like chatbt like I type in BBedit as an integration. This is also I I&#x27;m very annoyed by and am very sensitive to the coin nature. &gt;&gt; Oh this is really great. No, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m asking for. I want you to</p>
<p>actually go in and find stuff. uh so I do not use it to actually generate any any exact content but &gt;&gt; okay so targeted research and then critique &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; those would be the the two biggest use cases um you&#x27;ve written a lot about the</p>
<h2>The TSMC break</h2>
<p>TSMC break this idea that the limiting factor on all AI expansion is basically the rate of TSMC capacity expansion because all most AI all AI chips are fabbed at uh at TSMC. It seems like as you look at the AI space and everything interesting going on, uh so you know for mostly chip constrainted right now, which would not have to be the case, you could be power constrainted and stuff,</p>
<p>but if you&#x27;re um uh chip constrained, uh there&#x27;s a population of people who want to expand very quickly, the AI labs, Nvidia, people like that. And then yeah, famously, which uh you know TSMC, which is more conservative in how it expands. Why is that? Like why why does the market signal not cause them to build out fab capacity faster? &gt;&gt; Because the risks for fabs are basically larger than for anyone else. You&#x27;re you&#x27;re spending billions and billions of dollars on a fab that if it&#x27;s not fully</p>
<p>utilized, if you end up with too much capacity, number one, those all those all your costs are locked in. Like basically 99.9% of the cost for a fab is depreciation, which you&#x27;re paying the depreciation. No m like you already showed you&#x27;re paid in cash flow obviously but it&#x27;s on your accounting statement no matter what. &gt;&gt; Uh so the fabs can be extremely profitable. TSMC&#x27;s margins are higher than ever but they can very quickly tip over into having a huge problem. And then once it&#x27;s already built these fabs can run for a long time. So that excess capacity is depresses prices for years to go. I</p>
<p>mean we see this in memory all the time. memory famously goes through these cycles like what&#x27;s going to happen we&#x27;re going to believe it or not we are going to have too much memory capacity in a few years because we have such a shortage right now like Micron just announced like uh there a huge new fab in Singapore like right and everyone&#x27;s going to do that and which is and so but why has this happened to memory &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s three competitors in memory if Micron doesn&#x27;t do it SKH will if SKX doesn&#x27;t do it Samsung will and so you have a dynamic where a healthy dynamic which is the fabs know better but they</p>
<p>can&#x27;t help themselves and so they take on the risk and they build these fabs. The problem we have with logic is that TSMC doesn&#x27;t have that pressure and so they&#x27;re actually behaving rationally. TSMC is giving up potential long-term revenue. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the downside for a fab in particular is so large that they don&#x27;t want to realize that downside. Can they not pass the risk on to the customer where it&#x27;s like you are going to pay for the entire fab? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s probably what they need to get to. And so Apple famously uh did a lot</p>
<p>of this uh sort of prepaid and particularly when TSM was sort of expanding hugely in the 2010s and they maybe need to get even more explicit about that. But I think the better solution and the cheaper solution for the hyperscalers in the long run would be to do what is necessary for TSMC to get better. Then you get it for free. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you don&#x27;t need to prepay it. So there&#x27;s this risk that&#x27;s out there this risk of overbuilding. &gt;&gt; Right now TSMC is shifting all that risk to the hyperscalers to Nvidia to Apple.</p>
<p>And the way it m and the reason why they get away with it is because the risk is foregone revenue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s money you don&#x27;t make. And worse than that, it&#x27;s money you don&#x27;t make four or five years down the road. And everyone like what does every company say on their earnings right now? We could have made more but we don&#x27;t have enough supply. Y &gt;&gt; and if you think it&#x27;s bad and why is it bad right now? Chat GPT comes out. Every hyperscaler starts investing like crazy. What does TSMC do? They actually decreased their capex year-over-year. two years in a row &gt;&gt; they did they there was no market</p>
<p>response from TSMC to the chat GPT moment now they increased to 41 last year they&#x27;re going up to like 60 this year but even that increase to 60 is a less percentage increase than than last year I think we&#x27;re looking at a massive short shortness in chips in 2029 uh or or so and particularly as the other thing the compute density of AI is so much larger right if you have an agent outdoing stuff it&#x27;s doing so many more computations in a limited amount of time than me and my googling is even humanly possible to do and all these lookups. So</p>
<p>we have a CPU shortage too and Intel Intel &gt;&gt; shut down some of their CPU plants, right? Uh so it&#x27;s it the whole semiconductor the uh I just think it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a big problem and we&#x27;re shifting to for a long time like how can we get an alternative to TSMC for geopolitical reasons &gt;&gt; and the truth is it&#x27;s kind of like the bundling thing. It&#x27;s really hard to get companies to buy insurance particularly when the insurance is uh number one you have uh like everyone else wants someone else to do it right who&#x27;s going to be</p>
<p>the one to go go and make the sacrifice but also it might not happen China might not attack Taiwan &gt;&gt; and also &gt;&gt; as long as it doesn&#x27;t happen it&#x27;s super suboptimal to go somewhere else cuz TSMC is better right &gt;&gt; and their customer it&#x27;s not just their their fab&#x27;s better their customer service is better and they have all the IP blocks you need and they&#x27;ve done this before and you have existing relationship and they&#x27;ll punish you cuz they women, they have control because they like they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not going to fulfill all their orders right now because there&#x27;s so much demand and so they can pick and choose sort of who and so people are scared. They don&#x27;t want to</p>
<p>go anywhere else. Uh and and the uh so uh how are we going to solve this problem? And I think I actually wrote on the front page of Shery about this this week even which is basically the same thing I wrote in update but this was a like &gt;&gt; this someone needs to wait. Yeah. Someone needs to the hyperscalers in particular need to appreciate I think a massive crunch is coming &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s now on them to get Intel up to speed to get Samsung up to speed to get a credible alternative. Yes, in theory you could pay</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; for political geopolitical reasons or for shortages. &gt;&gt; No, we&#x27;ll get the geopolitical reasons for free. Okay. I think there&#x27;s massive economic reasons to do so, &gt;&gt; which is all the revenue you&#x27;re going to be forgoing in 2029 if you don&#x27;t do it now &gt;&gt; and then we&#x27;ll happily get geopolitical uh insurance for free. &gt;&gt; But if TSMC are the best, like isn&#x27;t rather than like stand up Intel, which seems hard, isn&#x27;t the answer to just again prepay for an extra fab build out for &gt;&gt; this is like how do we feel in tech about ongoing operational costs as opposed to putting in some money up front and fixing the problem permanently? the the market structure is</p>
<p>a problem. You&#x27;re dealing with a monopolist &gt;&gt; and like not a like a mean monopolist. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re very nice, right? And they actually have not arguably not raised prices nearly as much as they should have, right? But the the reality is there&#x27;s this market structure problem that is going to impact the hyperscalers and it behooves them I think to fix the structure otherwise the costs of ensuring they or overcoming that are just going to be be larger and larger. &gt;&gt; This seems like the topic you have felt strongest about in the past year or two.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I felt pretty strong with Apple Vision Pro. &gt;&gt; Okay, fair. What was your take with Apple Vision Pro? &gt;&gt; They finally showed an NBA game and they kept changing cameras. They&#x27;re applying 2D television production techniques to an immersive technology. Just let me say courtside. &gt;&gt; I know the TSMC break seems like a bigger deal. Um &gt;&gt; Oh, probably. &gt;&gt; I have some rapid fire questions or I&#x27;m not going to say rapid fire necessarily, but um uh more uh a collection of disconnected uh questions for you. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll connect them. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I</p>
<h2>Rapid fire</h2>
<p>&gt;&gt; Great. Um how should schools do homework now that AI exists? I think they should incorporate it and they should probably do in-person exams like uh or in like the &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you you it&#x27;s silly to try to crush it out. I&#x27;m very opposed to these like AI detectors which don&#x27;t work is more I mean probably I&#x27;m particularly sensitive to it because obviously a lot of my pros is in these models. Um no one like my thing was I wasn&#x27;t an MD user but um I&#x27;m a world&#x27;s biggest semicolon</p>
<p>user. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh, which &gt;&gt; I was a big M user all. &gt;&gt; Oh, unfortunately the models don&#x27;t seem to have really incorporated the the semicolon mayo. I haven&#x27;t been that influential, but um but yeah, no, you you want kids to use it &gt;&gt; cuz whoever can use AI most effectively in their jobs going forward is going to have a big advantage. &gt;&gt; Um, so there&#x27;s probably some return to, &gt;&gt; you know, more in-class being more important. I think the this my this is my view on content generally. This is I I just uh I think there&#x27;s a world in which not all content but some content</p>
<p>is more valuable than ever because AI is a perfectly individualized experience. What you read is not necessarily what I read. So stuff that we both read &gt;&gt; is actually compelling and I&#x27;m very interested in &gt;&gt; figure out how to leverage that to be sort of beneficial to people in the long run. And what can you get from school that you can&#x27;t get elsewhere, right? like I can read the notes, I can read XYZ, but there&#x27;s being in class having a discussion about it, like actually interacting, being pushed on these sorts of things. All this is a sort of a</p>
<p>beautiful theoretical depiction of what school might be that is probably very far removed from the reality. But identifying things that are common experiences are going to be more and more valuable. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Common content, common classroom time, live events, like shared experiences because anything that&#x27;s individualized is just going to be completely swalled. &gt;&gt; Yes. Do sports teams become &gt;&gt; more valuable than an AI abundance. &gt;&gt; Everything live becomes more valuable. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s something I&#x27;m thinking a lot</p>
<p>about as far as my business, right? Like the &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s some aspect of tens of thousands of people reading the same thing every day. Yes. That is actually really powerful. There&#x27;s something interesting there. the possibility of doing live events where people can come together. Uh you I think a lot about community. I think no one&#x27;s ever really solved community around content like a message board or comments or not. You have to get very bad dynamics. There&#x27;s a few people that dominate it. &gt;&gt; Totally. &gt;&gt; Uh but what is great is &gt;&gt; if we&#x27;re in a group chat and you share an interesting article and you have a discussion about that. Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh so there there&#x27;s a lot of stuff around that I think is really</p>
<p>interesting and that I&#x27;m thinking a lot about. &gt;&gt; What do you think of what&#x27;s going on in crypto these days? &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s crypto? No. Uh, I&#x27;ve always been a crypto defender. Like, uh, just because digital scarcity is fundamentally interesting, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s probably even more interesting to this point in a world of infinite content, which you thought we had infinite content before. Now we have infinite content on steroids. &gt;&gt; Uh, not just a six billion humans typing away, but agents generating stuff sort of constantly. &gt;&gt; And in that world, I think crypto as an identifier of authenticity is going to be more and</p>
<p>more important. Like the at the end of the day, I want the original. I don&#x27;t want a reproduction. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m optimistic about humans ability to create value where it seemed impossible it would ever exist. I&#x27;m literally a professional like podcaster and content creator and get paid a lot of money to do it. Uh imagine explaining that to someone on the farm worried about the the automation. Speaking of that, you mentioned that a majority of strate uh consumption is now in the audio form</p>
<p>rather than the written form. &gt;&gt; As far as I can tell, I don&#x27;t do like but the more than well more than half my subscribers are subscribed to &gt;&gt; I consume the audio form. Yeah, it&#x27;s quite interesting. I added the pod this is actually where I started building my own software. I was begging everyone to support paid podcasts. There was dedicated paid podcasts and there was like writing ones and no one would do it. So, of course, I had to just hire engineers and build it myself, at which point it obviously was the right thing to do. Now, everyone does it. Um, whatever. That&#x27;s my fate in life, I guess. But the uh Yeah, people love it. Like, the interesting thing is I&#x27;m not</p>
<p>sure it&#x27;s been good for my business. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Oh, cuz people &gt;&gt; The good news is is I think it drives retention cuz people would build up emails cuz it&#x27;s like it feels like a lot of work &gt;&gt; and they say, &quot;I haven&#x27;t read this in ages. I unsubscribe.&quot; Whereas it they just consume seven minutes or eight minutes. The problem is they don&#x27;t share. Yeah. Audio content is not shared. &gt;&gt; Totally. I listen to it in the car on the way home from work and uh that&#x27;s great. And then I &gt;&gt; never think about it ever again. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; But it&#x27;s great for me because I can write the same I can say the same thing the next day. You&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, that was a very insightful comment. You even know</p>
<p>I said it yesterday.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. We if we reason about what sectors are going to be important down the road, you know, for the AI buildout, energy is um is going to be a big a big deal and the ability to actually power the data centers that are coming online. Uh that may be a bigger constraint going forward than even chips. Uh robotics are clearly going to be a big thing. It seems like China is doing better on energy and better on robotics and is catching up on chips, doing okay on, you know, the AI</p>
<p>models. But does that mean China&#x27;s potentially very well positioned for the coming wave of tech trends? &gt;&gt; I mean, I think any country that is capable of actually building things is well positioned. But then again, the counterargument uh if I could sort of put a silver lining on it is the challenge, the trick going forward and to sort of defy the doomers as it were is actually creating new sorts of value, new sources of value in a way that humans are uniquely capable of. And that is by definition a sort of an innovation</p>
<p>story. It&#x27;s a freeing up resources from things that can be done by machines &gt;&gt; to more productive. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s having a consumer market that pulls out that sort of innovation that makes it possible to write a newsletter or a podcast and actually pay for it. &gt;&gt; And so there is a scenario where China is well positioned to win the total commodification of everything which doesn&#x27;t have much margin. &gt;&gt; Mhm. and the actual value creation and what makes humans humans and</p>
<p>generates the value that I think people in AI are skeptical can be created &gt;&gt; despite the fact 90% of us use working agriculture and like 1% do uh for some reason that&#x27;s not going to repeat uh &gt;&gt; if you want to be optimistic that&#x27;s the sort of thing that America has always done well</p>
<h2>Feedback on Stripe</h2>
<p>&gt;&gt; what&#x27;s your stripe feedback for us &gt;&gt; oh where to start Uh, I mean I am obviously it&#x27;s hard for me to write about Stripe because I&#x27;m not biased because I was very early. I think you you introduced the billing API in 2011 which is a direct spur for wanting to do thinking this was a business model that was possible. So very very big thumbs up on that. &gt;&gt; The you didn&#x27;t warn me about this. I should have thought about this. Uh actually you do have you have one huge issue that I was just dealing with. Oh yeah. a &gt;&gt; your a implementation is a is someone can go in and if I try to add on to an a</p>
<p>plan so we&#x27;ll say I have a team cuz that&#x27;s where you use a like large companies and they want to add someone on &gt;&gt; if that add-on fails the entire plan gets canceled &gt;&gt; so we have to build a bunch of logic to handle that independently &gt;&gt; okay so &gt;&gt; so that&#x27;s a very detailed specific problem that we&#x27;re facing &gt;&gt; buggy a subscription interactions okay that&#x27;s a good one &gt;&gt; uh there&#x27;s there&#x27;s definitely more I&#x27;d have to go back and think about it. But I mean, I do think the, you know, we didn&#x27;t talk about stable coins in this sort of area of of I&#x27;ve always been a big skeptic of like microtransactions &gt;&gt; because the problem it goes to the</p>
<p>investigative reporting thing. You can&#x27;t build something sustainable if you&#x27;re only monetizing in the back end. &gt;&gt; And the only way to do that is to have a very large market, which this is what YouTube is. YouTube is a bunch of speculative video makers hoping that they&#x27;ll get enough views that the ads will pay for it. and they&#x27;re such a large scale and they monetize their ads so effectively that it works. There&#x27;s no market like this for written content or like podcast content and you can&#x27;t people are like oh pay for one article like no what you&#x27;re paying for when you &gt;&gt; when you pay for me is you&#x27;re paying for my ongoing production. I&#x27;m making a</p>
<p>promise to you I&#x27;m going to write something every day and you&#x27;re paying for that promise. You&#x27;re not paying for the actual content. The content is is a byproduct of that. The question for AI and microtransaction is you have all these labs paying people all over the world to generate data and like you know if you&#x27;re like a radiologist you get paid $300 an hour. I saw an article about it and all these sliding scales &gt;&gt; and they&#x27;re all duplicating work. This is because they&#x27;re all you know everyone feels a sense I can get differentiation. What we clearly need is some sort of market mechanism</p>
<p>for data generation that in the long run will replace what we&#x27;re getting from journalistic enterprises which are even more doomed than ever before. So how do you generate uh like you&#x27;re paying directly for content and then AIs can get it and can you can build a large market like YouTube &gt;&gt; that people will speculatively do it trusting that they&#x27;ll get paid because the market is large enough. That&#x27;s what needs to happen. Like a lot of things, there&#x27;s this massive valley of how do we get from here to there? Um, but we&#x27;ll see. I know Cloudflare is trying to push</p>
<p>on that. So, we&#x27;ll see what happens. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Last question. How would you rate the execution of the major tech companies &gt;&gt; like the big five? &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; Uh, Apple traditionally very strong. Their manufacturing remains amazing. Like the iPhone Air that just the alarm went off and make sure I turned the snooze off. Uh, the greatest smartphone ever made. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I never even seen one. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s thin. Is the battery life good? &gt;&gt; Good enough. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like it&#x27;s bad. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s that? &gt;&gt; It sounds like it&#x27;s bad then. &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s fine. I mean, I actually forgot</p>
<p>my external battery and it&#x27;s doing okay now. And I&#x27;m back in Wisconsin. I have to wear jeans cuz it&#x27;s cold and it slides right in. Uh, it&#x27;s f actually I love it. Okay. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m very devastated to hear they might not make it regularly. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; obviously Apple&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s software has gotten pretty rough. their relationship with devel I mean the Apple is so interesting because the reality is when it comes to platforms you have to build the price of becoming a platform is making a great product so Apple gets platforms so they make great products and they&#x27;re terrible stewards of the platforms Microsoft is a great platform steward but they can&#x27;t make good</p>
<p>products so they never get the permission to sort of have big platforms uh which is sort of a tragedy there um &gt;&gt; but Apple it&#x27;s some you know it&#x27;s an old company driven managers, not founders. And maybe they, you know, the AI Siri got as bad as it was is obviously really bad. But at the end of the day, we still need devices. They&#x27;re still better at them than anybody else. So, they&#x27;ll probably be okay. Um, Google, I&#x27;ve had the hardest time understanding Google in part because I think Google does a lot</p>
<p>of stuff suboptimally. almost everything I feel like they do suboptimally, &gt;&gt; but I think that lack of like Apple can be super optimist, &gt;&gt; but I think it&#x27;s their lack of optimization that actually makes them maybe the most resilient of all the tech companies because they never they never get so exactly doing what they should do and they have all this extra fluff and doing things and gazillion science projects, but because their their their core business model is so good, it throws off so much cash, they can just</p>
<p>sort of be sort of &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; very flexible. And I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that about them. Everything that frustrates me and analyzing them actually has this hidden benefit of resiliency and strength and adaptability. &gt;&gt; And you know, they&#x27;re like the the the amorph what&#x27;s this? what&#x27;s the the slime that just will like and if they&#x27;re coming in your direction like you&#x27;re actually in big it might take them &gt;&gt; a really long time to get there but when they get there you&#x27;re doomed. Um, so</p>
<p>Microsoft, Microsoft is always I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of mileage right about Microsoft. Everyone is especially in the SAS era. All these companies are like, &quot;Oh, the Microsoft sucks. We&#x27;re going to make the best of breed product.&quot; &gt;&gt; And guess what? Uh, startups in Silicon Valley, they want to buy all the best of breed products and they have the capabilities to send them together. &gt;&gt; Joe in managing the tire shop doesn&#x27;t care about he just wants this crap to work and to work together. And if it&#x27;s all mediocre, but it kind of works together, that&#x27;s better than best of breed. And right just just squashing</p>
<p>these companies would grow and just hit the hit that Microsoft wall again and again. Is that going to persist in an AI world? It&#x27;s probably tied to the SAS question sort of before in some respects. &gt;&gt; They their distribution and and power there, you know, remain sort of substantial. &gt;&gt; Meta&#x27;s probably in my experience &gt;&gt; been the best execute. There&#x27;s I mean you usually see stuff like interacting with PR or executives like they just run such a tight yeah that that&#x27;s always been very impressive to me. I think the again I think their ad model is underrated. The trick with them is keeping engagement like that that&#x27;s what</p>
<p>makes the whole thing go. They&#x27;ve done a decent job of that. hours spent in chat GPT hours not spent on Instagram or not spent and I think that that&#x27;s an underrated area and I think they&#x27;re kind of betting that look that&#x27;s all fine and well today but in the long run this is an infrastructure game we have cash flow to fund it and &gt;&gt; open AI doesn&#x27;t I think open might be a bigger threat to Facebook than Google something worth considering &gt;&gt; but uh Facebook is obviously clearly spending to to meet it so now Amazon</p>
<p>Amazon. There&#x27;s a lot of there&#x27;s a lot of fab capacity and power being spent on tranium that um one wonders could be better spent on on other chips. But we&#x27;ll see what happens. &gt;&gt; Aren&#x27;t people happy with the trinium chips? &gt;&gt; The degree to which Amazon optimized uh cloud computing I think is underappreciated when you&#x27;re operating in a commodity market. So there&#x27;s two ways to succeed, right? You could have a differentiated product where you can charge a high margin &gt;&gt; or you can have a lower cost structure in a commodity market where the the price floor is the market price but your</p>
<p>cost structure is lower than your competitors. So that&#x27;s where you make your margin. That was how Microsoft that was how Amazon dominated the cloud. They their their their cloud was way more optimized than anyone else&#x27;s. The whole Nitro architecture like just the way they architected everything doing a lot of their own chips shifting to Graviton. I think the thing with graviton their sort of their ARM CPU is they could who&#x27;s the number one customer for graviton Amazon itself and so they can move all their loads to that optimize it build all the software libraries and then start offering it on a cost basis to others that&#x27;s the playbook that</p>
<p>they&#x27;re trying to run with trrenium where the number one customer trrenium in the long run is Amazon but then they develop all the capabilities around it for other people for it to be attracted to other people at lower prices and they they have that structurally smaller cost structure. The problem is that works when you sort of leveled off in performance, right? Amazon executed this model between 2005 and 2025. Of course, processors got faster in that time, but not it wasn&#x27;t like the 80s or 90s when every leap was massive.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Does that does that work in a relatively new market when there&#x27;s massive leaps to be made generation on generation and they have Nvidia servers? Do they have as many as they could? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh because they&#x27;re on this strategy. Um I see &gt;&gt; probably not. &gt;&gt; Ben, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ramp founder Eric Glyman on the many ways AI is changing corporate spending</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRPCRIhrYac</link>
      <description>Eric Glyman is the cofounder and CEO of Ramp, the finance automation platform that now powers over 2% of all corporate spend in the US. He sits down with John and co-host Alex Rampell to discuss how Ramp scaled to over $1 billion in revenue in just seven years, and why the future of fintech is "selling time, not money." They cover the "SaaS apocalypse" (and why lines of code are becoming a liability), how Ramp uses AI agents to review 100,000 expenses a day with 99% accuracy, and why their internal data suggests the US economy is much stronger than the Census Bureau reports.

<h2>&lt;Untitled Chapter 1&gt;</h2>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if we need, if we want to do this, but— I already look like that naturally, so. Oh, this is Kevin from &quot;The Office.&quot; Yeah, yeah. Eric Glyman is the co-founder and CEO of Ramp, the corporate card and finance automation platform. Founded in 2019, Ramp has taken the industry by storm. Oh, cheers. Cheers.</p>
<h2>Ramp business today</h2>
<p>Can you describe maybe a good framing, just the Ramp business today? What&#x27;s the biggest part of the business in terms of where you make money? What are the new growth lines? Any metrics you can share on the scale? Alex and I have a million questions, but maybe you can start by just framing it up for us. Yeah, of course. So first, just the pace that this has come together has been pretty remarkable. Seven years, yeah. You know? I think by the time we were, six years and change, the company had passed over a billion a year in revenue. The largest portion of that is card. And so, that might be a classic</p>
<p>kind of interchange-based model. But behind it— So this is people, in their business they have spend cards, everyone walking around the company has a Ramp card. And you run interchange on those. That&#x27;s right. Next, you can think about bill payments and software. Software, it&#x27;s a two-something-year-old business line, just about two years and some months. That&#x27;s over 100 million a year business line in and of itself. And that can be advanced functionality to maybe manage lots of entities, to automate aspects of accounting, maybe aspects of procurement, bill payments.</p>
<p>So this can be sending checks, wires, ACH and that&#x27;s predominantly a float as well in some cases foreign exchange transaction business. Treasury. That&#x27;s a product that is about a year old, several billion dollars of deposits. Some of that is checking-like products. Some of that is more of an investment and money ladder type product. And then the last, the other ones are procurement and then travel, which is a bit of an in-kind. And what&#x27;s been so interesting is that if you break down and look towards maybe let&#x27;s say contribution profit, gross profit of the business,</p>
<p>a few years ago it would&#x27;ve been 90 plus percent card. I think by the end of this year, the second, third, fourth, fifth lines of business will comprise and aggregate the majority of Ramp&#x27;s business. And so, it&#x27;s evolved into this platform by which if you&#x27;re trying to operate your company, it&#x27;s just a lot more efficient. You spend less. I think people know Ramp for, we help the average company cut their expenses by about 5% per year. The thing that&#x27;s been really fascinating</p>
<p>is people are starting to use these products in aggregate. Not only are they not paying for five, six sets of point solutions, but they&#x27;re also not wasting time. They&#x27;re growing faster. The average customer last year on Ramp grew their revenue by, I think it was 16%, which compared to, in the United States, the average business— Much higher than that. Yeah, I think it&#x27;s 5% in the US. And so, in some sense what we&#x27;re trying to do is be not just a better platform, but a better, almost kind of digital brain for organizations to allocate resources and make sure spend is not wasted.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, you start by selling, say, spend cards into a business. The CFO likes it, the employees like it, and then that gives you permission to go sell some of this other functionality. And so it&#x27;s kind of a classic multi-product cross sell. Is it always starting with spend cards or do you now have multiple front doors into the business? It&#x27;s been the big story of the past year. I think there were, over the last quarter, thousands of businesses that came in just for bill payments. There&#x27;s accounting firms that are becoming into,</p>
<p>they say, &quot;We&#x27;re a Ramp shop here if you want to work with us. We&#x27;ll bring in bill payments, treasury...&quot; We use Ramp to go power that and they can manage 10, 100, 200 clients all through one platform. And we&#x27;re excited. I mean, probably the fastest growing line of business is procurement. Or, they&#x27;re single clients that are looking to kind of bring in and do full-scale purchase orders across, whether it&#x27;s single or a dozen plus entities, all the way through. And so, that&#x27;s been</p>
<p>the really fun story of the past year.</p>
<h2>The *correct* expense policy</h2>
<p>Do you have a view on what the right policy is for employee spend within a business? I love that you ask this, yeah. 37signals or someone will say, &quot;Companies are so lame. you just give everyone a credit card and trust people and it&#x27;s fine.&quot; And then meanwhile, large companies are like, &quot;Well, this hotel is in a Tier 2 city and therefore there&#x27;s this dollar limit and it must be booked 14 days in advance.&quot; And so, you see companies operate at really two ends of the spectrum in terms of how much flexibility they give people. What is correct for a company, or does it just vary by size? I love this question.</p>
<p>And the interesting part, if you really kind of dig into Ramp&#x27;s businesses we have ways of back testing and actually understanding based on how strict your policy is, how things are running. Does that have an impact on how much time your employees are, let&#x27;s say doing expenses, how quickly you&#x27;re growing. And you can start to actually compare based off of the operating hygiene of the company… What are end margins? What is a pace of growth that occurs at the company?</p>
<p>And I bring this back to what— So you can do a correlational study between expense policies and company growth. Yeah. And look, it&#x27;s pretty interesting. I mean, the first, there&#x27;s an aspect of, in most companies, particularly high growth companies, it tends to resemble something closer to the &quot;no rules rules&quot; Netflix approach of we&#x27;re going to trust but verify and shine a light on it. Spend tends to be reasonably permissive. But then part of the breakthrough of the past year is you could basically take an expense policy, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s written</p>
<p>in plain English. &quot;If the flight is more than five hours, you can take business. If it&#x27;s under...&quot; Things that would&#x27;ve been horrible to go and have your managers go and verify this stuff, now you can run that through an LLM. I think that we&#x27;re processing over 100,000 expenses a day that are being reviewed agentically. This is a very fast-growing subset of the business. So you give the Ramp agent this company&#x27;s expense policy and then it applies it to the transactions that are coming through. Exactly. And so you can start to do things</p>
<p>like, I think about the episode you&#x27;d had with Susan Li. It was incredibly instructive where, she sort of says, it would feel so silly and it&#x27;s not a great use of my time in some sense to be a very expensive machine learning algorithm to do, to review expenses. But yet somehow a lot of people in companies are reduced to that thanks to Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules around it. Now you can have an agent functionally that does that, that takes that aspect of the job. And so, it has access to the full set of data that you would, all the transaction-related metadata, the receipt data, the timing data, the policy data.</p>
<p>It then can go in real-time review. Was this in or out? Can have the full audit trail explaining its reasoning. And today it&#x27;s over 99% accurate, which turns out it&#x27;s much more accurate than people are. So people don&#x27;t know the expense policy and expenses are pretty automated. And I find this thing super interesting, in part because I don&#x27;t think it should be anyone&#x27;s job to go and review people&#x27;s expenses, but somehow, while it&#x27;s in no one&#x27;s JD, the law kind of requires everyone to waste an hour of their time every month, if you&#x27;re a manager.</p>
<p>And does the law allow for it to be reviewed agentically and then just signed off on by the human? It does, yeah. The goal of this is separation of duties. That you yourself are not reviewing your own expenses. There needs to be a set of procedures that govern and actually are effective through the action of, okay, the rule says this. Did you take some steps to do this? It can be a system— Yeah, you can&#x27;t self-certify. The funny thing is that, I mean, one way of doing this… Actually, we used to do this is why not just post your expense reports in the public eye, right?</p>
<p>So, and the reason to do this is actually it could go wrong. You could say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to spend... You stay at the Four Seasons, I&#x27;m going stay at the Five Seasons.&quot; You could go that direction. But what you actually want is a moral code. It&#x27;s like, if you were the owner of the business it is your own money. Yes. So if you were staying at the Five Seasons, I&#x27;ve just made that hotel chain up, it&#x27;s like, you&#x27;re— Sounds pretty nice. You&#x27;re stealing from yourself, why would you do that? The problem is that once you get to tens of thousands of people, how do you impose that moral code? And actually like the two tent poles that you just mentioned, they&#x27;re both bad. Because if you have to stay at a crappy hotel</p>
<p>and you&#x27;re about to sign a two million dollar contract and you didn&#x27;t get any sleep. It&#x27;s the Motel 6 and you take a two-hour taxi, it&#x27;s like, all right, you saved the company money. That does not make sense. Stay at the Four Seasons. But you can&#x27;t really embody that in, &quot;if this, then that.&quot; Because what you want is this moral code. Like that&#x27;s what you want. And like how do you actually instill that? And there&#x27;s almost a behavioral psychology way, which is like, we&#x27;ll just show what people are spending. If you&#x27;re at the top of the leaderboard, we might trust but verify and verify a lot more. But that&#x27;s the hard thing to do</p>
<p>and actually preserve as the company goes from the founder, to the founder plus the founder&#x27;s brother to many, many more people. How do you keep that same esprit de corps or this informal code. I think it comes back to… What was the name of the movie? &quot;12 Angry Men,&quot; I think it was where, as you&#x27;re watching the film, you get some level of detail and someone seems very guilty. It&#x27;s a dead shut case. And as more evidence emerges, you realize actually, this may be different. And you need more context</p>
<p>in order to arrive at maybe a moral conclusion. Did it relate to closing a project? How does it relate to an outcome that maybe you&#x27;ll see emerge one month, two months after you stayed at the Five Seasons and closed the deal that changed the company, whatever the example is. I would argue in favor of tools that have more context, that do more jobs of work. Because not only can you do the narrow job better, but you can start to get at the answer of what actually is right for shareholders.</p>
<p>Where should we be allocating capital? It&#x27;s so interesting to hear because every company approaches this differently. Like I&#x27;m on the board of Wise and you know, Kristo flies coach everywhere, everybody flies, that&#x27;s just the policy but it might be penny-wise, pound-foolish. Again, not for me to say, but I also really admire the corporate code. It&#x27;s just like you, actually, that is cultural. It&#x27;s kind of weird to say expenses are cultural, but they are. For sure. Yeah, it&#x27;s shared— Shared belief system. It&#x27;s a shared belief system. It&#x27;s like, what is the culture of the company?</p>
<p>You talked about your expansion into Bill Pay.</p>
<h2>Bill Pay</h2>
<p>It seems like bill payment has proven, over the past 40 years, uniquely resistant to automation and modernization. If you look at how a typical business pays their rent or if you order a keg of Guinness, you&#x27;ll get a PDF emailed to you by some person who has a relationship with you and there will be bank account details which hopefully are correct. And you send a payment to those. And even bill payment products, you guys have a bunch of technology here,</p>
<p>but it&#x27;s like, we scan the PDF in an automated way or we ensure that the bank account details weren&#x27;t mistyped or something. But it&#x27;s kind of &quot;putting a little bit of lipstick on the pig&quot; of the whole system being super antiquated. Why is the system so antiquated when it comes to bill payment in particular? I think this is some of what Alex was bringing up. It&#x27;s the constraints of programming things in an &quot;if this, then that&quot; kind of world are very heavy. There&#x27;s a lot of complexity. And when you think about the nuance and algorithms that govern why do companies spend money under some circumstances,</p>
<p>how hard it can be to record. I wouldn&#x27;t overlook... Let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;re a manufacturer and you&#x27;re buying some asset which you&#x27;re going to use for five years and it&#x27;s going to depreciate. It&#x27;s a very different accounting treatment versus I&#x27;m buying a pay-as-you-go SaaS app. All the complexities around that might govern whether or not you decide to spend. And then finally, once you get all this detail, how do you review this and decide where to allocate your next marginal dollar is very complicated. But many systems are in place upgraded</p>
<p>despite the fact that that&#x27;s pretty complex. So credit cards started with no real-time authorization system, which is crazy. And you just hoped that they were good for— Carbon copy. Exactly. The machine with the pleasing sound. They&#x27;d do great in the current ASMR environment. That&#x27;s true. But then they added, you could call up and get an authorization and then they obviously added to the current systems we know where— The modem, you forgot the modem. Exactly. And then the modem. And so, in place credit cards were upgraded with much better capabilities. And similarly, if you look at checks and how they work,</p>
<p>even though we think of checks as antiquated, it used to be the case that physical checks had to be flown all around the country to be physically settled. And then there was the Check 21 Act in, what was it, the year 2000? Where they said a scan of a check is good enough and so they could be digitized by the banks and then shredded. And then there was the, you can take a photo of a check with your phone. And so we&#x27;ve managed to take this super old-timey check system and despite the fact it&#x27;s super old-timey, in some ways it has actually been meaningfully upgraded. And if you looked at the bill pay system from the outside, you would say we should have DNS for companies. So rather than a company</p>
<p>like sending you their bank account details, you should look them up in some central clearinghouse. And that way you confirm that you&#x27;re not being phished. A lot of spear-phishing attacks work that way. Although you referenced this. So there&#x27;s actually an indifference point that you can graph. If interest rates go up high enough, if I send you a check, which is like a paper mail check and that takes five days and hopefully the USPS goes on strike for two more weeks so I&#x27;ve got the postmark. I actually benefit… It&#x27;s actually cheaper for me. You legally paid, right? It&#x27;s crazy. No, it&#x27;s crazy. This is the problem.</p>
<p>Like credit cards, everybody... I am in the store, I want the TV. You want to sell me the TV. We both want this done right away. And in the knuckle-crunching, ASMR, carbon-copy days, they might not have been willing to sell that to me because they didn&#x27;t know if I was good for the money. They&#x27;d never seen me before. And the interesting thing is that AR and AP are almost an adversarial process. You mentioned this. What do you want to do as a controller? Well, you want to pay as late as possible and you want to collect as early as possible. And then you have this weird thing where checks, it&#x27;s not just an accident</p>
<p>that they stick around for a long time. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a financial incentive for one party. So that&#x27;s true on payment timing, I agree with that but there are some things that are just a dead weight loss, like the ability to fat-finger a bank account. No one benefits from that. Everyone has a horrible time if that happens. No, that Nigerian guy. There&#x27;s some people that benefit. Nigerian princes. Let&#x27;s think of everyone. I will posit that many networks have been upgraded in place. But somehow the loose network of businesses paying each other via PDF invoices has proven very resistant to in-place upgrades.</p>
<p>Also, I love your notion of DNS for payments or for expenses. So, I don&#x27;t know if you saw this, Google wanted to issue a 100-year bond. Yes. So, why is that interesting? Imagine that I am owed money by Google. I am one of the small businesses that you reference. Their job is to pay me as late as possible. Yes. They can borrow money for a hundred years at like 3% or whatever it is, cheaper than the US government probably. T plus a hundred, yeah. I mean it&#x27;s a little more expensive than the US government, but they are borrowing... That&#x27;s crazy.</p>
<p>I can borrow money at 20%, but why do I need to borrow money? Because Google&#x27;s paying me late. Those jerks. So, I should be able to borrow money kind of at the rate at which Google is borrowing money because my AR... My AR is their AP. But the problem is, unless you put all this together, you would just look at me and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re just a little schmuck. I&#x27;m going to charge you 18%.&quot; It&#x27;s like, yeah, but it&#x27;s Google. They could borrow money at T plus whatever, you know, SOFR plus a hundred. 100%. That&#x27;s not fair.</p>
<p>But the only way to really solve that is with more data and actually entangling... Not entangling, but just kind of connecting these things together. For sure.</p>
<h2>AI and software</h2>
<p>What&#x27;s your vision for once AI is doing a lot of software engineering, what does that look like in three or four years time? Is the competitive equilibrium similar, but the expectations for the amount of software and functionality businesses are shipping is much higher? Are software teams similar looking, different looking? Again, you&#x27;re doing a lot of AI engineering. What does the future hold? It&#x27;s all blurring. It&#x27;s totally crazy. There&#x27;s a designer shipping code. Marketing at Ramp reports into</p>
<p>our CTO Karim, my co-founder who&#x27;s doing some of like the best marketing I&#x27;ve ever experienced and seen. We have customer support agents like shipping code to production too. I just think that the half-life of you see a problem to how long it takes for you to go fix it and do something about it is shrinking immensely. Or if you want to change a color of a button, you can just say, &quot;Hey at Ramp Inspect, can you change the color of this button?&quot; And it goes and spins it up and it does it within minutes.</p>
<p>It verifies and validates it. And so, I actually think in some sense, these classic barriers that software businesses had are clearly going to erode. Yes but, there&#x27;s the old joke of &quot;It&#x27;s much more fun to write code than read code,&quot; which explains a lot of software engineer&#x27;s behavior. And it becomes easier to change the button. Is that another instance of it being more fun to write code than read code? Where lines of code are a liability and not an asset because they&#x27;re something you have to reckon with. And so, are companies at some level incurring</p>
<p>some tech debt now where they&#x27;re adding a bunch of code, which will maybe be harder to reason with later? Or do you just get bailed out by the models getting better? It&#x27;s really interesting. And by the way, one of the other interesting sub-conversations I&#x27;m hearing a lot, too, is when you think about where tech debt comes from, there&#x27;s a set of conditions and trade-offs you make, you write things in a discreet and deterministic way. Under these circumstances, follow this code path. Under this circumstance, follow this other one. In a world where there&#x27;s LLMs</p>
<p>and the models themselves are improving, I think it&#x27;s entirely possible that the way that code is written is you say, &quot;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m solving for. Under these kinds of conditions, here&#x27;s what I want to occur. Go write the code that drives this outcome.&quot; And maybe with the models such as they are today can get it done in sort of a spaghetti code written fashion. But it kind of works even though it&#x27;s some kind of Rube Goldberg machine underneath the hood. But as these models get much smarter, you might write your code base in such a way where you say, &quot;Every year, rewrite the underlying code,</p>
<p>but here&#x27;s the outcome I can drive.&quot; And today you accomplish my outcome 90% of the time, 95, 98, 99, 100. And do you just have kind of self-healing and writing code all the way through? And this notion of like underlying code does goes away because we&#x27;re writing things in this different manner. Obviously, there&#x27;s real conditions in which that&#x27;s not going to… That won&#x27;t occur. Like, if you&#x27;re writing code that needs to have, four nines of accuracy and uptime, like that&#x27;s probably not the methods you&#x27;re using. But if you&#x27;re like a growth engineering team, that&#x27;s probably what you&#x27;re doing today</p>
<p>if you&#x27;re kind of on the leading edge of this stuff. And so, I find this stuff very fascinating. And when I think about the deeper implications of this stuff, I think that if you are completing this small amount of cognitive work... Let&#x27;s say you are an expense app. The spend has occurred, it needs to go get the... Write it down somewhere and get someone&#x27;s approval. And that&#x27;s all the knowledge work that you&#x27;re doing. That&#x27;s very few tokens in order to accomplish that,</p>
<p>both to create the infrastructure in order to facilitate it, like that probably evaporates. Anyone can probably custom write that kind of app. Whereas if you&#x27;re doing much deeper kind of work, such to underwrite a company, provide financing, automate areas of accounting. I think the fitness function for companies becomes can you actually do things in such a way where even if you could spend tokens on it, it would take more tokens to create the thing or do that work than the system maybe that you&#x27;ve built to kind of drive that outcome.</p>
<p>I just think the rules of what it means to be a software company are changing. I think network effects and what you&#x27;re building is more important than ever. Like, if you think about the classic set of moats that are there, I think that this question of where are their moats in a world where... I like Dario&#x27;s way of putting this. If you have a country of geniuses— Data center, yeah. Living somewhere and they&#x27;re writing code and they&#x27;re incentivized to compete with you, too. If you&#x27;re not really following what are the classic four moats</p>
<p>and building towards that, like, I think life gets a lot harder. Yes. Do you guys have a house view on the new competitive equilibrium with a lot of AI engineering really working? Well, I think there are a couple things. I think Marc talked about this a little while ago, but what is an EPD team? Engineering product design team. Product development team. You normally have one product manager, maybe you have five to eight engineers and one designer. And now everybody has Cursor and Claude Code. So the designer is like, &quot;I don&#x27;t need</p>
<p>any of these bozos.&quot; The product manager says, &quot;I don&#x27;t need any of those bozos.&quot; Each of the engineers are like, &quot;I don&#x27;t need any of these bozos.&quot; And they&#x27;re all— It&#x27;s like the start of &quot;The Dark Knight.&quot; And they&#x27;re all right. It really is, it&#x27;s… Exactly. And they&#x27;re all right. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re all wearing the Joker mask. Or, the Joker mask is Claude Code or Cursor. But the problem is, because I was talking to one of my CEOs, this is a pretty scaled company, lots of revenue. And they use all these tools, they&#x27;re not more efficient. And he is like, &quot;Why aren&#x27;t we more efficient?&quot; And it&#x27;s two things. Number one, it&#x27;s a real company,</p>
<p>they have real customers. They can&#x27;t just push things and hope for the best. But it&#x27;s like you actually have an HR problem in that if you&#x27;re building from scratch, granted you have nothing, you have no tech debt, you don&#x27;t really have to worry about customers, you don&#x27;t have any, but you wouldn&#x27;t have an eight person EPD team. You would probably just have each person... We have eight different product managers slash engineers slash whatever. Each one is a pod unto themselves. So that&#x27;s one thing. I totally agree on the data moats where that has become more important.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you a story that you might like. I met this company, vLex. It&#x27;s a 25-year-old company. This guy Alex bought up every legal record in Spain, like probably going back to 1492. Buys the Ferdinand and Isabella... Here&#x27;s the document, I&#x27;m going to take a picture of that, I&#x27;ll sell it to every law firm. And he built like a $20 million a year SaaS business, bootstrapped for 25 years. And then it went to like a hundred million in one year. Now why is that? Because he used to sell this document or he used to sell a subscription</p>
<p>to Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Latham &amp; Watkins and all these big law firms. And a paralegal would take that, they would turn it into a document. They&#x27;d charge the client $10,000 and ChatGPT can&#x27;t do that. GenAI can&#x27;t do that. But you know who can do that is vLex. Another good example of this, of who has proprietary data? A lot of times, the data&#x27;s free. This is the really cool thing. Or it&#x27;s sitting, I wouldn&#x27;t call your data free, but it&#x27;s not like for-sale data sets. Do you know domaintools.com?</p>
<p>It&#x27;s my favorite business. So DomainTools runs a cron job every day on every single internet website. They do a WHOIS lookup every single day. And they build a historical record of that which no one has. So if you want to see who owned stripe.com in 1999, well, it was free in 1999. If you invented time machine, go run that WHOIS query in your terminal but you can&#x27;t do that. So you have to pay them. But all that data is free or FlightAware with ADS-B data. So you have a lot of these weird businesses. And of course this is not a new idea,</p>
<p>like FactSet, Bloomberg... You have aggregators of data, but that becomes so much more valuable. Totally. Because your 10,000 geniuses cannot do that. 100%. You always experience this if you hire someone extraordinarily talented, like top of the class at MIT and you say, &quot;All right, join the engineering team and go ship the code.&quot; And they ship something kind of crazy on the first day. And it&#x27;s sort of slow. And it&#x27;s like, you can have someone who is intellectually an absolute giant, but learning kind of how a company does things</p>
<p>the way it does. Learning the procedures and nuances of an organization takes time. It&#x27;s part of what makes working with interns or junior engineers fun. I think the learning curve is obviously immensely steep. And I think that the speed at which, with sufficient access to the data and the procedures of a company, they&#x27;re going to get there very, very fast. But these moats are real, you know? Well, the other moat I would argue is the dark-mattered moat. Yes. And what I mean is you know, like the Milky Way, nobody could figure out why the mass is the mass because it&#x27;s like all the observed stars and planets and everything else.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s, no, actually the vast majority of the matter, or energy, because they&#x27;re the same thing, is dark matter, dark energy. And what does that mean? Nobody the hell knows. But it&#x27;s just like, we don&#x27;t know it. And for products, it&#x27;s like you built, if I tell Claude, &quot;Go clone Ramp.&quot; Because this is the SaaSpocalypse that&#x27;s happening right now. It&#x27;s like, oh, of course. Well, I just went to the website and now I have a website that looks like Ramp. No, no, no. There are like nine million edge cases. The tech debt sounds bad because it&#x27;s a pejorative, debt = bad. But actually it&#x27;s good because what you&#x27;ve done is you&#x27;ve uncovered every single problem that can go wrong.</p>
<p>The fact that, I mean, a great example, remember when the power went out in San Francisco a month and a half ago? So we have this amazing thing called Waymo. Waymo had not figured out this corner case of what if the power goes out? It was a thundering herd problem with the customer, or the human overrides, yeah. But they had no idea. And it&#x27;s actually great that that happened. You need these problems to happen. For sure. And just because my background, I used to write shareware, this try-before-you-buy software. Shareware was a big thing. That&#x27;s a blast from the past. It&#x27;s a blast from the past. So there&#x27;s a website that&#x27;s part of CNET—</p>
<p>That might come back, you know? Well, but it&#x27;s freemium. This is where I&#x27;m going with this story and you&#x27;ll like this. So Download.com was the preeminent site for downloading shareware. It was like... CNET was one of the most popular properties in 1999, 2000. So, all of the top downloadable software products were there— Download.com sounds like a company that had a Super Bowl ad. They would&#x27;ve. I bet they did, actually. They probably had two. I&#x27;d be shocked. They probably had five. Right between Pets.com and something else. So Download.com had all the popular products and then this site called Elance shows up and Elance is now called Upwork.</p>
<p>This connected you with work that you would want done by very smart people, basically in the developing world. So I want a software product built. Here&#x27;s everybody in Romania and Russia and India. I want translation, I want graphics. So what ended up happening is people would look at the Download.com top list because before it was a very cottage industry of who wrote shareware and it was very profitable. Like ID software shareware company, McAfee shareware company. Actually Cybersource started off processing payments for shareware companies. That&#x27;s how they got McAfee. That&#x27;s funny.</p>
<p>Very interesting history to this we can talk about some other time, but basically what happened is people found Elance, like, &quot;Oh, I could pay anybody $500 to clone anything on this list. Everything on this list makes tens of millions of dollars a year. Let&#x27;s go.&quot; And the cloning never worked. It functionally worked. Because if I say &quot;I&#x27;m going to clone Eric.&quot; I might not know that you have a pancreas. Right? I&#x27;m sure you do. I might not know that you have two kidneys. So the problem is that cloning just, it goes skin deep and like that&#x27;s the embedded advantage of these companies. Do you then think</p>
<p>the SaaSpocalypse is kind of irrational? I think it depends. I think some of it is very rational. Because if I want, if I have a feature that became a company, and I know this sounds like a very negative thing to say, but I want to get paged if my server goes down. It&#x27;s a very logical reason to build a company called PagerDuty. That now has a lot of stuff around it but I might just say, &quot;Hey, whenever my servers...&quot; There are corner cases, there is the proverbial the power goes out in San Francisco, do something differently. That&#x27;s very, very different than NetSuite, which is, I have a saying that I like,</p>
<p>which is the best companies have hostages, not customers, at least in enterprise software. Not for you because you actually have INPS. But that they&#x27;re much harder to go rip that out and a lot of it is like the &quot;Goldilocks zone&quot; that you operate in. If you&#x27;re too expensive, of course I&#x27;m going to try to rip that thing out. If it&#x27;s so cheap then I forgot nobody even used it. So you have to be in this Goldilocks zone, you have to have enough complexity. And ideally the front end is different than the back end. So, Workday I think is... Nobody&#x27;s going to get rid of Workday.</p>
<p>And I actually credit David Ricardo with this. Like, comparative advantage. Sure, you could grow your own food. You could plumb your own plumbing. But you&#x27;re not going to do that. And somebody could do your own HR system. Yes. The one maybe pitch for Stripe and others that I would say here is, I do think that that is right. And there is a lot of complexity and local tax law for payments and things that make Workday</p>
<p>an extraordinary business. There was this overarching macro question of how does work get done? If you believe that. You know, work can get done through tokens and models. And presumably it doesn&#x27;t go through payroll, probably goes through a credit card or check to these types of companies. And so, the share of, it&#x27;s almost this sort of simple math that if you X-rayed the P&amp;L of most companies, the majority of it classically, at least for asset-light firms, is payroll. You&#x27;re paying for people to do things</p>
<p>and SaaS is maybe a small percentage of a company&#x27;s income or a company&#x27;s cost base. Does suddenly that share grow to high single digits, low double digits, significant double digits? And does the share actually move where, the payroll economy itself, even though maybe it grows, becomes less relevant? I think this is the really funny part of even as this has been going on, what do I know as a private company other than seeing our own payment data.</p>
<p>But you start to see these companies beating their earnings in a way they never have before where the terminal value perhaps is falling out. But they&#x27;re saying, &quot;Shareholders, we&#x27;re reaccelerating.&quot; We haven&#x27;t seen this since 2021. We&#x27;re going faster and you&#x27;re going to have multiple progressive quarters of this actually occurring for certain types of businesses. And so, it&#x27;s a really interesting time to... I very violently agree with your view is like yeah, it depends. But it&#x27;s doing really well. That&#x27;s my brilliant comment, it depends.</p>
<p>Yeah, you mentioned... Very Howard Marks of you.</p>
<h2>Stablecoin-backed cards</h2>
<p>As you&#x27;re hearing from Eric, Ramp has become the default way a lot of American companies manage spend. Stablecoins allowed that functionality to work in many countries all at once. With Ramp&#x27;s stablecoin-backed corporate cards, businesses can fund a balance with stablecoins, issue cards against those balances instantly, and allow employees to spend anywhere cards are accepted without the business having to think about stablecoins all the time. Same card experience, same controls, just a much more global set of rails underneath. This is one of the many practical ways we&#x27;re seeing businesses on Stripe use stablecoins by launching card programs in many more countries</p>
<p>and doing so in much less time than it would&#x27;ve taken otherwise. If you&#x27;re thinking about using stablecoins to expand, Stripe can help.</p>
<h2>Ramp data</h2>
<p>You mentioned your spend data. What does the spend data that Ramp sees tell us about the economy? I think it is stronger than many people understand in lots of ways. I mean first, I&#x27;ll go back to one of the things that perplexed our team for a long time. Our economists on the team saw this data even as recently as last year were the Census Bureau would do these periodic surveys. They&#x27;d go out and ask</p>
<p>&quot;How much is your business using AI to produce goods or services?&quot; A very refined economic way of wording the questions. And they would come back with these pronouncements saying a single digit percent of businesses in the US have adopted AI. And we looked at our data and we support over 55,000 businesses. We lean a little bit towards tech but not heavily. It kind of resembles the distribution of businesses you would see in the States. And well, the majority of businesses have used AI. You look at businesses whether they&#x27;re paying for—</p>
<p>As in they subscribe to ChatGPT or Anthropic or something like that. Exactly. Or, maybe a business that is a true agentic… Cognition or a Cursor, something like that where this is kind of vertical application. And so, one, there is this disconnect between the use of tools if you look at how quickly businesses are adopting and responding to these new tools versus what maybe people report on. Next: growth. I think it&#x27;s been clear over the last few quarters is the US itself is reaccelerating, GDP growth is gone from maybe the one to 2%,</p>
<p>area to four to five and you could argue how much of this is, a little artificial with subsidies, but it&#x27;s been pretty significant. But subsidized by what? Some of the Big Beautiful Bill as well as some of the tariffs. And where that&#x27;s been reallocated, I think some people, I would argue on the whole maybe unfairly said this. I think that there&#x27;s more durable growth inside of the businesses. But I would say overall business health is much stronger. And I think that the really interesting thing and again some of this is specific to the data that we see, but I think that businesses are generally</p>
<p>getting more and more savvy about finding tools that help them be more efficient. And I think what skews our data is maybe the savings we drive for people. Seems the way of explaining it is like people know the, Ben Franklin would say this phrase of &quot;a penny saved is a penny earned&quot; and this is awesome aphorism but the average American business has an 8% profit margin. And so mathematically speaking, a penny saved is equivalent to 12 pennies of revenue earned. And so, if you save businesses a lot,</p>
<p>you end up with these outcomes of the average Ramp bases materially outgrowing the regular US average. And we can clearly see this and demonstrate this for our own set of customers. I suspect these types of things are occurring at businesses adopting these new sets of technologies, I would argue probably faster, very clearly, than what the US is maybe, the classic sources are seeing. So I think it&#x27;s much healthier.</p>
<h2>How to cut your expenses</h2>
<p>When a business saves money on Ramp, what happens? The CFO comes in and says, &quot;Oh my god, we&#x27;re spending— Confetti. &quot;Way too much money, on confetti. We don&#x27;t need this much confetti.&quot; Who&#x27;s buying the confetti? &quot;We have huge stockpiles that we don&#x27;t need.&quot; What happens when a business saves 5%? What are they actually cutting? So there&#x27;s two pieces of it primarily. One is like these hard-dollar cost savings and then some of this is time, and I&#x27;ll start with the time because it&#x27;s the squishy one, but I think that it&#x27;s, in some cases, actually much more important.</p>
<p>Oh sure, they save time on their expense reconciliation. That makes sense. So they&#x27;re no longer going through line by line and therefore there&#x27;s one person who is freed up to go do something else. Yeah. And I think one of the classic biases that people forget is people chronically undervalue their own time. As a principle of business, everyone has an hourly rate. Within a business, human time is incredibly expensive. I think the lean companies got this right and eliminated the bottlenecks there. So, okay, that&#x27;s one form.</p>
<p>What else? Next, all right, when you start to have these fine-tuned kind of controls. This part has been I think probably the biggest lion&#x27;s share of this. Let&#x27;s go back to one of the earlier conversations of why do people use checks, this horrible system and purchase orders. Well, one of the advantages of checks is unless you mail it to someone and you sign it, no money can leave your company. And what every person knows who&#x27;s ever had a credit card and gone to a gym once and had a good New Year&#x27;s resolution. But is you go a couple times</p>
<p>and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Goddammit, this gym is charging me.&quot; The difficulty of sending a check is a feature, not a bug. Yeah, exactly. But it&#x27;s part of what Ramp was the first to build. One-time use cards. Single-use cards, but also more than that, merchant blocking. So you can, whether it&#x27;s on one card or 10,000 cards at once, build in a kill switch to say, &quot;Okay, we&#x27;ve signed this new deal with this merchant. We are only on Uber, we are no longer taking Lyfts. And anytime someone goes and tries to go on merchant A or B, you can do this.&quot; Or you sign a new contract and you say,</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going spend $10,000 only with Salesforce and on the 10,001th dollar they try to charge you, it declines.&quot; And what gets to happen, you get to have a conversation with their sales team who really wants to make their budget. And if you look at this mathematically, for most companies that come over a low end, maybe a very hygienic company that is giving out a few cards and the old world could durably cut their expenses about 2% a year by doing this. Some of these very laissez-faire businesses are saving just 10%, just through these things. Next, you start ending up with these more fine-tuned</p>
<p>kind of controls where you can say under these circumstances I want to go and have kind of charges occur. Maybe you have an engineer stay till PM at night, you can go and buy a meal. But if you take an Uber on a Saturday, that should turn off. And so you have the cards, if it&#x27;s like an Uber on a Saturday auto-decline, but you can text and say actually it&#x27;s for work. You send back a yes, it turns on. And so it&#x27;s all these little tiny paper cuts that actually start to go into run. Next, it&#x27;s vendor data. One of the unique assets of Ramp is anytime you spend money, you upload a receipt,</p>
<p>maybe you upload an invoice or an MSA. This takes us back to the Paribus days. We know across hundreds of millions of purchases every year, not just that you spent money at a software vendor, but what did you spend per seat? And so if you&#x27;re a customer on Ramp and you&#x27;re about to go and pay this large bill on a random SaaS vendor, we can show you in real-time before you send the funds, you are paying 20% more than the rest of the market. Here&#x27;s kind of the cost curve of what others are paying.</p>
<p>And actually by going and empowering your procurement team— Do you have enough data to do that? Because my AWS bill is not like your AWS bill. And so, don&#x27;t you need to know how many instances we&#x27;re running to know if this is a good deal or not? You can, but you can still kind of get down to the level of is there a bulk discount or not? And start to know of, is there a negotiated aspect? There&#x27;s other types of things where I&#x27;d argue maybe a lot of classic software- as-a-service ends up in this way. It&#x27;s like your pricing is really dependent on, you know, did you sign that deal on January 1st</p>
<p>or on December 31st when the sales team really needs to hit the quota. And you can actually see down to the seat level, you&#x27;re paying $30 per seat. It&#x27;s a great time to be signing a Salesforce contract. Exactly. And so you can actually get down to the seat level and say, okay, you&#x27;re about to auto-renew. The market price has actually moved for the set of service. And so it can be very, very useful to procurement teams to know where they compare with the market.</p>
<h2>Ramp strategy</h2>
<p>That was actually my question for you, which is, so if you remember Groupon— Yes. The much beleaguered Groupon, but Groupon started off as a site called ThePoint.com/groupon because originally it was like, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the fact that Starbucks uses paper cups. If I get 10,000 other people to donate a dollar, we&#x27;ll fly a plane in front of Howard Schultz&#x27;s house,&quot; which also emits carbon, a bad example. But you only want, it&#x27;s a collective action thing. So, and then because I met Andrew Mason and Brad Keywell when they were first starting this business, it was like eight people.</p>
<p>It was ThePoint and downstairs there was a pizza restaurant or something like, &quot;Oh, if get like 50 people to agree to buy pizza, maybe they&#x27;ll give us a lower price.&quot; The cause became discounts. Yes and then, but then the thing is Groupon wasn&#x27;t known for this &quot;it has to tip&quot; because they always had the demand. So they never had to worry about it because before it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve got supply, you&#x27;ve got demand. I guess my question for you is, can you be the arbiter of pricing? Can you aggregate the demand? And the same way that like Costco, who shops at Costco? Every small restaurant shops at Costco. And Costco uses that collective bargaining power,</p>
<p>if you will, to say, &quot;Hey Coca-Cola, give us a very, very low price.&quot; They take very, very little of that because right now I&#x27;m using Ramp to buy stuff. Yes. But I would imagine if you could say, &quot;Hey, I have $100 billion.&quot; I didn&#x27;t know it was that high, that&#x27;s amazing. &quot;I have a hundred billion dollars of spend. I can hopefully direct it this way or that way. Please give me a 20% discount.&quot; Can you do that? Or is that further in the funnel of the purchase process? There is this large swath of businesses that I&#x27;ve been fascinated by called group purchasing organizations.</p>
<p>A lot of these came out of the healthcare world where it&#x27;s a very small set of— APMs, yeah. Yeah, exactly, supplier. But if you can go and aggregate demand, you could say, okay, for these type of purchases, you&#x27;re going to offer this procedure at this account for this type of equipment, you&#x27;re going to give this level bulk kind of discount. And you&#x27;ve gone and you&#x27;ve done that and I think these are very popular now in the private equity world. Even when I look at Ramp data today, there are dozens of, and more and more every year, of merchants where, you know, we were sending billions of dollars. It is truly, it is the client&#x27;s money,</p>
<p>they are going where they&#x27;re going. But we have a sense of actually, okay, where is this actually going? And can you go and say, you know, across the Ramp buyer base over the next 12 months, this is how many dollars will go towards you. Can we negotiate a discount? The other way which maybe starts to... Sometimes these businesses veer closer to advertising, but where it gets really interesting is we see the fastest-growing businesses. What are the businesses that people are getting really excited and are adopting really quickly? And we might have a signal of</p>
<p>these are actually good businesses and good tools and actually most businesses should move towards that. Could you go and actually start to say, &quot;Hey, your renewal is coming up in 90 days. Have you considered this other business who has provided a 20% complimentary welcome lower price to you?&quot; And so, there&#x27;s multiple forms that can take place. But the short version of it is, I think one, it&#x27;s yes, I think you can offer a bulk discount. But two, you end up almost getting closer to, back to this other theme of can you start to go</p>
<p>and maybe show businesses that directing their next marginal dollar will lead to this outcome. Well, it feels like there&#x27;s even like a third thing. Which is, I would call it merchant-specific balance. So imagine that it&#x27;s December 31st, I&#x27;m buying something at Whole Foods. And then I see an offer, not donate a dollar to the, you know, whatever charity they&#x27;re pushing. But it&#x27;s like, why don&#x27;t you commit $2,000 of spend for 2026 for $1,800? And the nice thing there is that they lock in</p>
<p>that spend for me. They actually collect it. I mean I know there&#x27;s a stupid law and all this complicated stuff. But the key thing is it&#x27;s almost a risk management and a loyalty play for them at once. Because the problem is that they don&#x27;t know how much celery to buy. They don&#x27;t know how many... So, it kind goes back to the AR/AP thing that we were talking about earlier. You nailed it, yeah. Because the other thing is not just saying, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m going to group bargain on behalf of all the different customers that I work with.&quot; But it&#x27;s an ancillary thing, which is you might want to just pre-commit your spend to a particular vendor. And that vendor would love to have that spend pre-committed,</p>
<p>even if they&#x27;re Amazon and their cost of capital is very low. Because they know they don&#x27;t have to worry when they&#x27;re planning their budget for the next year. 100%. That you&#x27;re going to churn in month nine. And that seems like another, like the closest that you can get to that is gift cards. Strangely enough which I&#x27;m sure you know well from your— It&#x27;s gift cards for business. Yeah because it&#x27;s like you go to Costco, this is actually a big business at Costco. You go to Costco, they sell gift cards. We were just talking about this. So they sell gift cards. You can buy $100 of Starbucks gift cards for 80 bucks. Is Starbucks dumb? Like why are they, if they&#x27;re worth $100? No, because they basically have, in the ecosystem, money that is going to be spent at Starbucks.</p>
<p>And yeah, there&#x27;s breakage and other stuff, but it&#x27;s actually a quite, it&#x27;s quite a valuable value proposition for the receiving merchant because they know that you&#x27;re going to spend your money with them. But I want to go back to your previous idea where McDonald&#x27;s every five years or whatever does a big bake-off between Coke and Pepsi and they always renew with Coke and they have a long-time… Maybe a movie theater chain is better example. All the big chains, like they don&#x27;t serve Coke and Pepsi, they only serve one and they do a big bake-off between the brands every five years. And you have lots of small businesses that are buying from Coke or buying from Pepsi.</p>
<p>And so, it feels like you could just do a bake-off between them saying Ramp is going to have a preferred vendor and you can obviously use a Ramp card on either, it&#x27;ll work, but we have preferred rates with Pepsi. Is that a thing Ramp should do? It&#x27;s a really interesting question. The short is I think over the long duration of time. Like I&#x27;m kind of bit of a crazy person. We should try everything is my actual answer. Claude Code. Yeah, Claude Code. Let&#x27;s go, let&#x27;s do it, build it. Pepsi. Make money from Pepsi. Go and negotiate. The cost of a phone call, a negotiation has never been lower, but…</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s this almost philosophical question of like, all right, where is the differentiation? What makes Ramp different? But isn&#x27;t that increasingly the scale? It is, and I think that you&#x27;re right in that at the very beginning of the company, the answer was very easy of like, look, our cost of capital is nowhere close to a bank&#x27;s. The interchange that we could make is nowhere close to it. We have all the disadvantages of scale and kind of the only thing that we could do</p>
<p>to compete with these people was we could… Everything was slow at the bank that I worked at before, it was hard to ship things. We need to move fast. We need to kind of have this emphasis around velocity to ship product and just kind of blitzkrieg faster than maybe others could respond. What it&#x27;s evolved into and I think is today probably the largest point of differentiation at the meta level between Ramp and maybe the financial service providers that we compete with is they sell money and we sell time.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll sell you a lower, like a loan at a lower cost of capital, rewards at wherever they set it. We will sell your expenses, done. And so, are you naturally skeptical of this idea because it&#x27;s selling money rather than selling time? I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m naturally skeptical. I would say that— It&#x27;s okay. We&#x27;re not precious. We have lots more ideas. No, no, no. It&#x27;s good. There is this question of, I think back to our roots, like, I don&#x27;t know. How do you build a product that is 10 times better than other folks? And I think when you get really large,</p>
<p>actually just a line drive is good and a 2x or a 3x is better kind of thing is actually good. But how do you find these sets of things that other your product offering is so different than what you can find elsewhere? And I think that we can conceivably, and I know this, you can negotiate with the large logistics companies. A deal with FedEx that would be better than what most companies are paying and I think that that&#x27;s interesting. Then you have all the sublevels of how do you get people to know about the offer, to sign in to the offer, to deal with all these sub things. Or you could just go and spend that next marginal hour to go and say like, let&#x27;s just automate</p>
<p>all of accounting for these customers. Let&#x27;s go and start doing financial work for these customers. No financial institution is able to compete on that kind of vector. And so, I would say it in the fullness of time, we want to do both. Like I think that you want to save people the maximum amount of time, the maximum amount of money that you can, but I think part of what makes us so different in this kind of world that we operate in is we have this obsession of sources of drag of the things that slow down purchases that lead you to overspend versus other companies.</p>
<p>But just to push on that, I feel like the differentiation for companies often has to change as time goes on because they start in one competitive equilibrium. And then as time goes on, they&#x27;re in another competitive equilibrium because it&#x27;s dynamic. That&#x27;s fair. And it feels to me that Ramp got its start with very fast product velocity and having this great product experience. And as you grow up, you can just build a scale into the product and scale… Scale-derived product advantages. Not just like we&#x27;re big, but like Costco,</p>
<p>the advantage comes from the scale and they really passed it on to the customer. And it feels like there could be a second stage to this rocket where you get going with faster product velocity. But then there&#x27;s actually a pretty different set of product differentiations as you scale up. I think it&#x27;s true. I think it&#x27;s well said and there&#x27;s this almost question of like, in every line of business that we&#x27;re building, where are we in the S-curve? How far are we… Is this a product that is serving these tinkerers, early adopters?</p>
<p>Are we in the early majority, are we in the late where we need to shift the business to kind of harvesting contribution, optimize price, not quantity in it or towards the end? And the thing which is so shocking and I think maybe as part of why I love this business and I think even too, I think about Stripe and many of the great businesses and payments that have been built. I believe today Ramp powers more than 2% of all corporate and small business card transactions in the United States. Which is amazing for a business that,</p>
<p>the product, you couldn&#x27;t even sign up for it six years ago. And yet that&#x27;s a really fancy way of saying 98% of spend is not on us. On Ramp yeah. And let&#x27;s say we do it again. We grew faster last year than we did the year before. I feel very good about the way this year is starting off and maybe it&#x27;s closer to four. 96% is still big. 92% is still big. It is so large. And by the way, there&#x27;s more ways to buy things than just cards. You think about bill payments.</p>
<p>And so, I think that there is an aspect of, for most people, there&#x27;s so much drudgery around... I think people are doing artisanal expense reports. You know, it&#x27;s fun to be like a hipster and spend an hour making coffee, but like, it&#x27;s a little crazy that— This is the blue bottle of expense reports. You know but unfortunately you&#x27;re in Concur and you have like this spinning wheel. It&#x27;s a pour-over expense report. It&#x27;s a pour, we love it that way. Single origin. You try it. It&#x27;s the experience. You&#x27;re the Nespresso. It&#x27;s much more efficient. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>But like, what I would say is this aspect of time is most people have not experienced this thing you know, is just a fact of life for building a business that&#x27;s been hard doesn&#x27;t need to be hard. Doing your books doesn&#x27;t need to be hard. And so, I still think in some sense in where we are on the S-curves of our business, I lean that way. But you&#x27;re totally right when you&#x27;re at this level where in the not too distant future… I mean, you&#x27;re there processing trillions of dollars per year in economic activity.</p>
<p>And we aspire to be there in the not too distant future. Sounds like you&#x27;ll be there pretty soon. We&#x27;re working our hardest. Exponential growth is a powerful thing. Yes, it&#x27;s definitely given me good things to think about and work towards. So I was thinking about when we met, when you were running Paribus. And it kind of feels like one of the first or second or third order effects of AI is the marginal cost of arguing has gone down to zero. I&#x27;m serious. It&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s just like, I mean, my wife got into an argument with some company and it&#x27;s like she used ChatGPT to argue with them,</p>
<p>they used it to argue back with her. And it&#x27;s like, I just saw the future. This is incredible. And like, we won, which is great. Your agent will talk to my agent, yeah. But you think about this from a chargeback where it&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey, this price went down.&quot; I mean this is how we, I remember like, this is such a good idea. It&#x27;s like the price went down, you have these breakage models that the card networks had. And Best Buy has to write you a check or Visa has to write you a check because that TV fell by 20%. But nobody does that. And now everybody&#x27;s going to do that. Or it&#x27;s like you do a chargeback for $5, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like, I thought it was Pepsi that I was buying at McDonald&#x27;s. It was Coke. Chargeback, right? Nobody&#x27;s going to dispute that because the cost is too high, but now the cost goes to zero. So I&#x27;m just... What do you think, I mean, it&#x27;s hard to, picture five years from now what the actual full effects of this are. But if you kind of think about that as the macro abstraction of it&#x27;s like marginal cost of arguing goes to zero. What changes? I think to be really explicit, I think what&#x27;s happening is the marginal cost of time, of knowledge. Yes. That is a much better abstraction. Is what&#x27;s going down so rapidly.</p>
<p>And I think about our customer base. Most of our customers don&#x27;t have a single software engineer, let alone a software engineer for their finance team. And if what we are very good at doing is selling functionally sets of work, maybe it&#x27;s embedded in a financial operating platform, but expenses done, accounting done, some type of knowledge work done, and you can deliver that. That is immense high-leverage value for these customers. Let&#x27;s say it costs $5 before, they didn&#x27;t do it, now they can get $5 of value.</p>
<p>But maybe the cost of… It&#x27;s a software type cost, maybe it&#x27;s pennies of tokens to actually go and do that. That is a great business to be in because it&#x27;s very high customer value. We can capture just a small amount of that and build this business. And when you go back to kind of the original insight of Ramp, we entered into this industry where it was very profitable, but not only was it misaligned, but people were fighting over like basis points. Every last dollar that went into rewards could have meant like tens or hundreds</p>
<p>of millions of dollars in profit for the business, for them. But if you think about for a customer, let&#x27;s say that in order to make one extra basis point as a business, you would try to incent them to spend a hundred more dollars. For that customer and let&#x27;s say they buy something that gym membership they didn&#x27;t need, or that subscription keeps going, they have lost $100, it&#x27;s gone out the door and maybe they go to the gym, maybe they don&#x27;t. But that is out of their bank account. And if you just try to say, I&#x27;m going to have a better rewards program, sure, maybe you can get that customer</p>
<p>a dollar or $1.10 back or some amount. That pales in comparison to helping them just not spend that $100, cancel the subscription. The economic leverage of that activity is much higher.</p>
<h2>Capital One</h2>
<p>You sold your last business Paribus to Capital One. Capital One is one of the biggest founder-run financial firms that people in Silicon Valley don&#x27;t talk about. What should we all be... And has been extraordinarily successful. What should we all be learning from Capital One in their success? Actually, I should say, how did they? What product really broke out for them? Just what is Capital One success? I think there&#x27;s a lot that makes them amazing as a company. Both the founders are excellent. Rich Fairbank, Nigel Morris.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s worth people reading up on their stories. It was founded in &#x27;90s, is that right? So, not quite. From a legal standpoint— I&#x27;m very wooly on my Capital One history. I think that legally the incorporation in some sense for Capital One, it was, I think it was in 1994, but the actual start traces back to the &#x27;80s. At the time Rich and Nigel had met, they were consultants and they had this insight that the business of credit cards was…</p>
<p>While it was lucrative, was not serving most of the country. The way you could kind of think about credit cards back then, you know Diners Club, maybe others have heard of it. It was was a way for rich business people to get together and have lunch. And like they put the card down and the restaurant would pick up the tab and they could go and pay the restaurant back later. And they had kind of navigated that and the simplification is if you had a very high credit score, you could get one of these cards with the benefits that it had.</p>
<p>And if you didn&#x27;t have a credit score that met that, you could have a debit card. And that was basically it. It was a very linear cutoff. And what Rich and Nigel… The insight that they had had is there must be some curve. We should be able to test this. Maybe we give people cards that have above an 800 credit score or something like that then. But what about 790? There might be people there that can go and pay for this. If and the way we could go and take on the cost of this, maybe we charge them a somewhat higher interest rate</p>
<p>until they prove their efficacy. If 790 works, let&#x27;s go to 780. So it&#x27;s kind of the BNPL of its day. There is a population who are, for whatever reason, just below the threshold where banks are giving them good access to credit where you can actually very profitably lend to them. This is right. Exactly. And so, they, in the &#x27;80s, were functionally pitching all these different banks to say, &quot;We should go on this exploration. We&#x27;ll even run this for you. Let us go and run this.&quot; And they went door to door to door to door to door— The banks didn&#x27;t buy it.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t buy it. And then finally, there was a bank in Virginia, Signet Bank, that said, &quot;Fine, we&#x27;ll let you run it. You can come join. We&#x27;ll give you this group and some resources to go build this.&quot; So they built this as this division inside of it. And it started to work. As this was going on, the computer revolution was taking off and it was sort of an unfortunate acronym, but they called it IBS. Irritable something something. No, it&#x27;s Information-Based Strategy. And they said, &quot;We could use different pockets of data</p>
<p>and run these.&quot; It was before there was big data, there was this kind of data of we could go and test. You know, maybe this person has a balance of $8,000 at this bank. We could send them an offer at this interest rate or this kind of you don&#x27;t need to pay back interest for six months or 12 months. And they could start to go and see the mathematical return against this. And this division started really working and it got so profitable it became a problem for the business and they convinced them to spin it out. And so in 1994, that is the founding as people know Capital One today.</p>
<p>But it actually was I think almost a decade in building to actually go and do this. I think that there was a lot that they got really right. One, I think that they took much more of a first-principles view of the business. Whereas others said, &quot;This is a profitable product. I&#x27;m going to do it like the other person and use scale and distribution advantages.&quot; They said, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s think about the product nature itself.&quot; There&#x27;s different, everyone&#x27;s making money on interchange. Maybe there&#x27;s lending could work and you could kind of have different strategies for different types of populations.</p>
<p>They did this so large where I think at one point they were the largest customer of the US Postal Service. They would send out so many offers I think until Amazon took them over. There was a period of time that they did this. So it&#x27;s incredibly experimental. They kind of carved the path and showed how do you go from credit facilities for fintech founders, eventually maybe you become a bank or buy a bank and carve that path. So there&#x27;s some tactical lessons. I also think they&#x27;ve done a great job of building a great and durable brand. One of the things that Capital One has done very, very well I think has focused on like,</p>
<p>what is the consistent visual message? What is the aesthetic and how do you stand out in this busy and different world? And so, there&#x27;s a lot of pieces to what&#x27;s made that company work, but— And they&#x27;ve also remained focused, which a lot of banks haven&#x27;t. I would say so. Well, I think that is a rewrite of history. They were doing like cell-phone financing, healthcare financing. They were a part of this thing. They have come back to focus after wandering in the woods. They had some JV, it was like America One,</p>
<p>I think it was called, to compete with Amazon. They were actually the most experimental business ever in a lot of ways. In, I think it was Hibernia Bank in Louisiana. And this was after Hurricane Katrina. I think it was maybe during it or just after they were able to buy. And it was like, it was an existential question for them. And I think that many people worried about, you knew this like, well too from the BNPL businesses where if you&#x27;re kind of a lending-based business, and it&#x27;s fine when interest rates are low,</p>
<p>but if there&#x27;s a crisis and people don&#x27;t want to lend to you, it can just break your business. And so they had these kind of scares and they said we need a stable kind of cost base. Eventually they bought a bank, which was in a lot of ways very good. They had kind of the deposits as this durable, stable, low cost of, or consistent capital base. But the flip side of buying it was they had to reconcile their culture of like crazy experimentation of trying everything to we&#x27;re a regulated bank now. We got to be bank people.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s more than just an attitude thing. If you are a nationally chartered bank— It&#x27;s real strictures, yeah. You know, look, it&#x27;s to a level of, let&#x27;s say the bank fails on Monday night. There is personnel. These guys in windbreakers in your office the next day. And they&#x27;ve probably been working there for some time before. You know, and so it&#x27;s... I think there was a change. In some sense, there is experimentation I think within certain constraints</p>
<p>would be how I would describe the Capital One post buying a bank versus before would be my read of it. But when you look at them in the &#x27;90s and 2000s, it was like them and in some ways, like name the high flying tech company. They were right up there in terms of share price growth. They started re-achieving it I think in the late 2010s. But it&#x27;s a fascinating company. I mean, I think the talent pool. So at Affirm, our first like really good risk person, but this is true for every fintech company. It&#x27;s just like, actually this is kind of cool.</p>
<p>Billy Alvarado, our first COO grew up at Capital One. I had played the piano and my teacher was taught by somebody who was taught by somebody. There was actually a chart, you can look this up. Czerny and Beethoven taught everybody who ever taught anybody. So like Lang Lang or Yuja Wang, like pick any famous pianist today. They can always trace their lineage 100% of the time to Czerny, Carl Czerny or Beethoven. Capital One is like the Czerny. Our Head of Risk Srinath Srinivasan, he&#x27;s amazing, came from Capital.</p>
<p>We had the same boss 10 years apart actually, in some sense. And all the heads of risk for all modern fintechs came from Capital One. Well, because it&#x27;s one of these things where you know that you don&#x27;t want to just hire for intercept, you want to hire for slope. And this is the problem is like you find, not to pick on Bank of America or Chase or somebody, but it&#x27;s like, all right, this person clearly knows how to do their job. The bank that they work in is worth a lot of money. But they don&#x27;t necessarily have, how do I put this delicately, the slope. They won&#x27;t know what that means because they don&#x27;t know what slope means.</p>
<p>But seriously, the guy that we hired just so… He was very, very smart. And that was the key thing about Capital One is that they didn&#x27;t hire banking people, they just hired smart people. And it became known as the place where smart people went. And actually the fact that companies would poach people from Capital One actually added to the alert. It&#x27;s like, I want to work at McKinsey because at the end of McKinsey, I&#x27;m going to get a better job somewhere else. Capital One job market. Capital One actually had, it did have that imprimatur. And I think part of it is it&#x27;s the only founder-led institution. Last question, Eric.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re talking about banking here.</p>
<h2>Treasury</h2>
<p>You have a treasury product. In five years, where do businesses keep their money? Is it with, I mean statistically mostly, you mentioned 2% on Ramp, it&#x27;s even higher today in traditional banks like a Chase or a Bank of America. There&#x27;s also neobanks, you know, I mean kind of bank-like entities like Mercury or Revolut or Monzo or things like that. There are companies like Ramp where you started in spend cards, but maybe moving more into treasury. How do you think that shakes out as a market? So, as a macro point,</p>
<p>I think there is an incredible amount of money made by institutions who are enjoying the profit pool and sharing very little with their end customers. You know, if you think about the implications of like the federal overnight funds rate. This is basically saying, hey, if you want to go and— Just it&#x27;s insane that there&#x27;s so little yield sharing in the current market. It&#x27;s crazy. I think that the national average for businesses, right, these are sophisticated entities with personnel. They&#x27;re supposed to be able to manage and put their funds in some place that&#x27;s more high yield. I think the national average</p>
<p>on checking accounts is 0.07% in the US. And so I&#x27;m guessing you don&#x27;t believe that Bank of America and JP Morgan and all these folks will wake up more altruistic one day. And so, what is the competitive process by which you think we&#x27;ll get there? I think that new businesses, whether it&#x27;s they have their own charter or they work with banks too that, this is not a monopoly. Like they have, everyone has competitors and it is a market that evolves. I think that that rate will go up, that the easier it is for people to,</p>
<p>whether it&#x27;s to create depository institutions, create accounts at these institutions, or create stores of value maybe even outside of these systems, maybe in a stable currency. And so, I think that rate goes up. I think part of what&#x27;s driven the extremely rapid growth of Ramp Treasury is it&#x27;s just a vastly better deal for customers. Maybe you keep three months of just walking around money in your checking account, but if you know the funds you&#x27;re going to receive and what you&#x27;re paying out,</p>
<p>well, we can move funds on the day payroll is coming due into that account and then every other day make sure the funds are earning the highest rate possible. And so, I think from a macro perspective, these things tend to go up in terms of the relative yield. I think there&#x27;s another question of slack in the system. If you have more and more... Money can think, right? If the dollars in your company have some level of intelligence like it&#x27;s able to kind of determine</p>
<p>when can it be spent, under what circumstances? It&#x27;s increasingly recorded in real time and there&#x27;s some reasoning around this, some ability to kind of opine of where should the next marginal dollar go? And you have systems that are able to think infinitely about these things even at AM in the morning when most of your team is asleep. Well, once you determine, like maybe you&#x27;ll determine I should keep the funds in some level in like a 2% or a 4% yielding account. But I think more of those dollars will go in flight actually to go spend to, if you have a business</p>
<p>that makes an 8% profit margin a year, that&#x27;s a lot higher than what you can earn in the overnight rate. And so in some sense, I think you have the dual effect. Smarter capital allocation. I think more dollars will be put to work. I agree with Alex&#x27;s macro point of if you kind of understand counterparties, you understand more information. I think that one, the cost of financing should go down and I think more dollars should be in the system in some sense. It&#x27;s actually a waste for everyone to have your dollars just sitting in a bank account. Who does that benefit? But it goes back to your time point. And it&#x27;s like the reason why I got mad at Chase a while ago,</p>
<p>and I still have a Chase account. And like why is that? It&#x27;s like I have a life insurance policy. I don&#x27;t remember the login for it. It&#x27;s just too much work. I wrote, this is a true story. Isn&#x27;t this an issue if you die? Yeah, I mean. Well, but they&#x27;ll pay my wife. I just don&#x27;t know how to log in and change the bank account. So, they&#x27;ll send her a nice letter I&#x27;m sure, some flowers. But, you know, why... Well actually, this is a true story. I wrote a check for somebody&#x27;s bar mitzvah. Mazel tov. Has not been deposited. Do I want to be the schmuck who has the bounced check? No, I don&#x27;t. So it&#x27;s like I have to—</p>
<p>This kid is keeping you at Chase. Well, great to see you. You too. Eric, thank you. Thanks for the Guinness. It was a great time.</p>]]></content:encoded>
