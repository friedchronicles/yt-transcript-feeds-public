      <title>Turning ideas into reality with Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCw6JIryJL0</link>
      <description>Figma democratizes design through its collaborative design products. It evolved from a design tool into an AI-powered platform when doubling its products in May 2025. In doing so, it helps teams go from idea to shipped product faster than ever before.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:02]</strong></p>
<p>Figma is a design tool that helps people bring their ideas out of their head and get them into the world. We want you to be able to get in there and design what you want. We cater to a lot of different people, a lot of different sizes of organizations and teams. Designing beautiful products and just making the world a more well-designed place is what Figma is trying to do. One of the things I love most about Figma is similar to one of the things I love most about Stripe, which is the focus on craft. We care about quality, we care about simplicity.</p>
<p>With Stripe, we have the ability to meet customers where they are. To charge them in their local payment methods and in their local currency. About 85% of our users are based outside the US. We have so much that we want to do, especially in terms of how our customers access Figma, how they get value out of Figma. We went from four products to eight. We introduced new tools for AI. Stripe is really meant to serve businesses from that initial moment where they have a single product all the way to when they're scaling.</p>
<p>It was really important for us when we were redoing our billing model that it was more transparent, simple and easy to understand for our customers. In the future, we want to be able to look at things like usage-based billing or other ways of billing our customers. We're able to know that Stripe is going to be ready to support us as we ship different types of products that just have completely different monetization needs. I think that is really empowering to be able to keep your main thing</p>
<p>the main thing, right? Keep your focus on what you're building and just depend on Stripe to handle payments, invoicing, compliance. I definitely don't think we would have been able to move at the speed that we did without Stripe. Stripe got into the details with us and that kind of felt like, you know, we depend on Stripe, but also Stripe is depending on our feedback to make the best product possible for everyone. And that kind of partnership, you just don't get to see it much.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Reinventing reimbursement for pet health insurance</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6AXruG-fxc</link>
      <description>Barkibu is one of Europe's fastest-growing pet health insurance providers. With a card-based insurance program by Visa and Stripe Issuing, Barkibu helps make quality animal healthcare more accessible for their customers by eliminating the traditional reimbursement model—so pet owners no longer have to pay up front and wait for reimbursement.

<p>In the backpack
is Minerva. She loves going
out and about, exploring with me and, in her favorite spots,
she’s the absolute queen. Gideon, he snores and he barks
really loud when he’s asleep. Yes, you do. Cannelle, she has a very
unique personality. Smart, a little sassy. CANNELLE! She comes back
when she wants to. Barkibu is a pet
insurance company.</p>
<p>Animals feel and they transmit 
that to you, and they help you. She’s called Fenki. Say hi, Fenki. There’s Lemmy. This is Michimoni. Lemmy! This is Max. Lemmy! One thing that
Lemmy likes a lot is escaping, too. He’s a little Houdini. The fact that we work with
this love for animals I think this helps us connect
deeply with many pet parents. We work hard to give
them the best product so that they can take care
of veterinary expenses</p>
<p>and, as a result, enjoy a healthy
pet for a long time. Visa and Stripe Issuing
have allowed us to be able to develop
this card product and to be able to really
fulfill our mission to help more animals. When you pay with
this card at the vet, you don’t pay out of pocket, 
but rather Barkibu pays and then charges you
for what is not covered. It’s a sense of security.</p>
<p>We can go
on adventures. If something were to happen,
they’re covered. I don’t need to worry if there’s
enough money in my account. They take care of everything. She's my priority,
my only thought. A cat! The best financial partner
we found was Stripe precisely because they
offered us flexibility, iterating very fast. This helped us a lot to
test new things with them like the card.</p>
<p>With the Barkibu card, we donate 3% of each transaction. We donate it to the pet parent,
and they donate it to a shelter. We are launching
in new countries. I would love that Barkibu grows much more
in all countries helping the largest
number of pets as possible with this card system. It would be so cool.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Satya Nadella describes how lessons from Microsoft’s history apply to today’s boom</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2OPYYthw4c</link>
      <description>Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, sits down with John to discuss the diffusion of AI inside the enterprise. He explains why “all your data at your fingertips” is the evergreen pitch, why this AI CapEx cycle is different from the .com bubble, and his vision for "agentic commerce". They also cover Microsoft's product bundling strategy and how he "wanders the virtual corridors" of Teams to run the company.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Bill was always obsessed. I remember him distinctly
saying this in the '90s, he said, "There's only
one category in software. It's called information management. You got to schematize people, places and things, and that's it." The problem is people are messy. Do people have loyalty to a model or do they have loyalty to an AI brand? You want an ensemble of models. You have agents
intermediating that ensemble so that it meets your needs. Will everyone's preference not just be for more intelligence? Like, I'll go into the picker and manually select o3 for like, "Where should I
go get ice cream," query? It's like a rite of passage
for certain software companies</p>
<p>to try to take on Excel. Why is it so durable? We sort of don't give it enough credit. It's like, "I can make it do anything."
I think the world's most approachable programming environment. 100%. And Pieter here is who? Pieter is Pieter Levels. He's like an indie—
Oh, yes, I know him. Yeah, you know Pieter Levels. I know him, yeah.
Course yes. You're so online. See, Satya knows who Pieter Levels is. This is why Microsoft is
like an $14 trillion company. Was there anything good
to see at the data center? Or is like—
There's always— "That's a lot of racks."</p>
<p>It's the most fun place to go, man. Yeah. Satya Nadella took over
as Microsoft CEO in 2014, but he's been with the company for more than 30 years and has seen a lot. Microsoft has grown by 10X in the time that Satya
has been running it. And he's credited with Microsoft's success first in cloud and now in the AI boom. Cheers, John. This is great. So what should people be
excited about at Ignite? The Ignite Conference for
us, more than anything else, is about making sure that
AI is getting diffused inside of the enterprise, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if there is one thing, it's more about, hey, what does it mean not to just admire somebody
else's AI factory or AI agent, but how to build your own AI factory. So organizing the data layer turns out to be probably
the most complicated thing, which spans the enterprise such that it can meet the intelligence. And so that's the stuff that I think we'll probably do a lot of. We still don't really have Deep Research in a corporate context. We do, that's what Copilot is about. But most people day-to-day
do not have this.</p>
<p>So are they just
underusing AI that exists? Yes, and in fact, it's
interesting you brought that up because to me that is the
killer feature, right? So the biggest thing we
did was we took this graph that is underneath what is what I think is the most important database
in any company, right, which is underneath your email, your documents, your Teams
calls, what have you. It's the relationships that... By the way, people are not
working in an ad hoc fashion in an unstructured way, but you know,</p>
<p>they're all doing it in
relation of some business event. Yes. That semantic connection is in people's heads and it's lost. And for the first time, there's much better recall of that. Why do you think this is underpenetrated than the enterprise? Because I feel like people
are using lots of, you know, LLM tools. They are uploading
individual documents maybe,</p>
<p><strong>[03:02]</strong></p>
<p>but I don't think most companies have the all singing, all dancing, all of the company's context is plugged into their everyday AI. Yeah, in fact, I would say
there are two sets of things. One, it's starting, right? I mean, you know, what I always say, at least compared to anything we have done in terms of all the office
suites over our history, this is the fastest in that sense, because it's change management, right? At the end of the day,
you've got to get it in, people have to use it. Oh, by the way, in the enterprise setting, it has got to mean all
the discovery has to work. All of the data governance has to work.</p>
<p>We have had to plumb
this purview into Copilot such that anytime I'm
trying to retrieve something that's confidential, it's
labeled confidential, it's IRM'd and so on. So there's been
significant amount of work, and that I think is where we're
starting to see the uplift. The other thing I'd say is, you know, it's one thing to have it work across the Microsoft 365 graph, right? But then the next thing is,
oh, what about your ERP system? The connectors kind of work, but they don't really because they're two thin straws, right?</p>
<p>You just need a much
better data architecture where you have to essentially
semantically embed all of these into one layer. Okay. There's been a vision for decades of your company's data at your fingertips. My favorite example of this is I read like the book
"Softwar" on, you know, the history of Oracle, and it talks about Larry
Ellison doing EBCs, I think they're talking about
one in Japan, in the 1990s. So it's the late 1990s. And he is pitching executives</p>
<p>on all your company's data in one place. Part of the reason this
is an evergreen pitch is because companies don't actually have all their data at their fingertips. Companies do not eat their
data infrastructure vegetables. And, you know, the pitch
to executives is always, "You can go answer your questions yourself at the touch of a button," as opposed to sending
a request to an analyst who goes and does an
investigation for you. Will we finally this time
eat our data plumbing? You can push back on the
premise, but that's my question. No, I think that, in fact, I
think, if I'm not mistaken, Bill coined this term,
information at your fingertips,</p>
<p>at a COMDEX speech, I think in the '90s. I think that's right, yeah. And that is kind of where it, you know, and for the longest time,
Bill was always obsessed about, like, he felt, in fact, I remember him distinctly
saying this in the '90s, which I picked up in one
of the reviews I was in as a junior guy sitting around, and he said, "There's only
one category in software. It's called information management. You got to schematize
people, places and things, and that's it. You don't have to do anything anymore because all software..." And that was the dream Bill always had, which is he wanted, like for
example, he hated file systems</p>
<p>because they were unstructured. He would've loved it if
everything was a SQL database and he could just do SQL queries and program against all information. Like, that to him was
like a elegant solution to information at your fingertips. The problem is people are messy, and even if data is structured, it sort of is not truly
available in one index, right, or one SQL query that I can
run against all of that.</p>
<p><strong>[06:04]</strong></p>
<p>So that has been the fundamental challenge of the old world, I would say. I would've not thought, none of us thought that somehow this AI thing and a deep neural network at some scaling will suddenly become the thing that figures out the patterns, right? Not some schematized data model, right? In fact, for the longest time we used to always obsess
about, oh, how complex do the relationships have to be, or the data model needs to be to capture the essence
of an enterprise, right? And it turns out it's lots of parameters</p>
<p>in a neural network with
a lot of compute power. Dwarkesh talks about this
really smart remote employee who started five minutes
ago, getting at the point that the models can be arbitrarily smart and they can do RAG and
they can have access to everything in your enterprise, but it's not quite the same as the model actually
knowing something as a model. And so the models, unless
you train custom models inside your company,
cannot actually get smarter at what it is that you do and, you know, the thousandth query is not
any smarter than the first. Where do you think that goes?</p>
<p>I think there're two things there, I mean, I think if I understand his thing, it's all about in context learning or continual learning, right? I mean, that's sort of the ultimate thing. And it sort of speaks to
the thing I was saying, which is if you kind of have
the models cognitive core separated from its knowledge, then you have essentially the
continual learning, you know, formula, so to speak, or the algorithm, and then you just unleash it. At least there are three things to me that are outside of the model at runtime that I think you kind
of have to crack, right?</p>
<p>One is memory, and all
forms of memory, right? Short, long, right? Even like these big
challenges of, you know, humans are great at long-term
credit assignment, right? Which is how does intuitively,
like somebody said to me, "Hey, the day, you know, AI models can both reward and remember that you, you know, how to punish for some mistake because
they have the ability to do long-term credit assignment, that's when you'll know
that you have real memory." But in any case, memory is one.</p>
<p>The second one is entitlements, right? So, which is they have to really respect all of the permissioning
system at runtime, right? Because this is where we put their roles, what access do I have, and so the model needs to meet that. And then the action space all has to work. So if you bring those three things, because after all, that's the environment. So if I have actions,
entitlements, and memory with these models, and they by definition have to be outside of the model, but be built into the model.</p>
<p>And so for example, in Copilot today, you use OpenAI models, you use even Claude, right? I need the system to work
across both of those. And that I think is where
the frontier has to move to. Yes, yes. I have many more AI questions, but I want to ask you some questions about your way of working. So, what does your day-to-day look like? And in particular, how are you
managing by walking around?</p>
<p><strong>[09:05]</strong></p>
<p>What virtual corridors are you wandering, to just get a sense for
what's going on in Microsoft? What do your customer
engagements actually look like? Just for a normal day, not earnings or not a board meeting or something. Interestingly enough, my normal day, it's the two ends of it, right? Which is the customer stuff, so there's not a day that I
would say I'm not having... Many of them are remote. I mean, there's Teams calls
for me most of the day, at least two or three of
them with some customer. It's sort of the most helpful way for me to stay most grounded, I would say.</p>
<p>So I have at least one
or two of those each day. And then I would say there is a lot of meeting time. You know, as a CEO, one of
the things I've recognized is there are two types of meetings, right? One meeting is where I'm
just supposed to convene and, you know, keep my mouth shut because convening was
the real thing, right? It is like, don't over
perform and just sit, because all the work
would've either happened or will happen after.</p>
<p>So that's kind of one. And then the other meeting,
which are the important meetings where I do need to learn or
I need to make a decision or communicate something. So meetings is another spot. Then I must say, it's kind
of like all over for me, Teams channels, right? I am lingering around Teams channels and they're most helpful. In fact, if anything,
I learn the most there, I meet most people that... So wandering the halls, I wish I could tell you that, you know, that is the form.</p>
<p>No, but I think Teams is the new wandering the
halls, right, you know, lurking around those channels. 100%, and then I meet... So the most beautiful thing is for me to be able to... That's where I make the
most connections, right? I get to know, wow, here's the person working on Excel agent, or that's the eval that they're looking... I mean, I learn so much out of it than anything else I've done. So are Teams at Microsoft just working away on their product and then Satya pops up and, you know, has a question on their product? Some of it, like, I wish— They give a little yelp.
I wish— Yeah, well, I wish, you know, sometimes I feel like we are
way too permissioned too.</p>
<p>You know, I wish I had
more access sometimes. In fact, my biggest complaint is that I can't drop in
everywhere I want to. But, yes, it's fun to be
able to just go in there and it sort of normalizes it. And then people are also,
like today's workforce is not shy of sharing
their opinion with you. I've noticed, yeah. You are famous, at least in
small corners of the valley, speaking of being methodical,
for staying very connected to what's going on in tech here.</p>
<p>And I remember you came and
visited the Stripe office. Remember that one in the Mission, yeah, when we were a pip-squeak company. I mean, it was probably right after you took over
as CEO, I'm guessing. But Stripe was very small
and Microsoft was very big. Actually before, I think the first time
I came to your offices was when I was running Azure first. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so it was even before that. So that would've been very
early in Stripe's journey.</p>
<p><strong>[12:07]</strong></p>
<p>Why do you think you do this
much more than most other CEOs? Because other CEOs should want
to meet all the startups too. I've always grown up, in
some sense, I grew up, even in a Microsoft, which had... I have that developer relations evangelism sort of gene in me, I kind of approach, I think a lot of it as, hey, if you don't follow developers... There are two sort of things
that are ingrained in me. One is if you don't follow
where developers are going, it's hard to sort of be relevant
in terms of tech platforms. And then you really need to
understand the new workload</p>
<p>in order to build a tech platform. Those are the two things
that at least I've kept. And so therefore, the only way, if you're not following
startups, it's very hard to know what is either the
platform or the workload. So that's sort of a thing
that I've indexed towards. The other thing is it's just, you know, I derive so much energy out of it, right? I mean, I've always thought founders are just magical people who create something from nothing. I mean, it's just sort of
feels like a magic trick. So I always like, "How the
heck does one do that?" Yeah, no, it is funny you say that about following what
the startups are doing.</p>
<p>We always conceived of
what Stripe was building as it was important to build for startups both because today's small startups are tomorrow's public companies. And we've seen that again
and again on Stripe. But we just felt at an intuitive level and we felt this before we could prove it, that what the startups were interested in were often better product experiences. And so if the startups want stablecoins or usage based billing or what have you, we should build for those needs.</p>
<p>Not just 'cause we'll have
a good startup business, but the enterprises will come around. And it took us, I would say, many years to kind of prove out that model. But now we're really seeing— Yeah, in fact, I think you guys are a bit of a gold standard on that. In fact, one of the things
that I learned from you guys was rediscovering at some level what Microsoft was very good at, which is following the developer, being where the startups are. And so that's what sort
of led me even to GitHub and NAT and all of the rest, which is to some degree
the GitHub asset, right? Obviously it is a great asset.</p>
<p>We needed to, one, be good stewards of an open source ecosystem. But it also the place where every startup, like the one thing that
everybody does have is their repos in GitHub. And I felt like, hey, being in that loop was important for us. Not just "oh it's strategically great to have some position
there," to learn simply and to build better product,
I think, is sort of well said. Because you lose sometimes the aesthetic of what is required, what's that friction-free way to deliver</p>
<p>because the least amount
of patience is there and the time to value, for
example, has to be maximized. Is Microsoft thinking about generated UIs that are personalized to... Like, when you think about it, software is stuck in the
old paradigm of, you know, we write a bunch of software
and it goes to Gold Master and as you know, goes out on discs and now that same kind of software, it's delivered in the cloud,</p>
<p><strong>[15:07]</strong></p>
<p>but the UI you want is probably, you know, we can render that exact UI in real time. Is that a direction you guys are going? I think that, for sure, like at some level what's happening is on one
side our ability to generate. I mean, if you sort of say
you can generate all code, so therefore you can
generate some UX scaffolding around anything that's a
lot more custom, right? So especially, in fact
for the longest time, one of the things at Microsoft was what's the difference
between a document, a website and an application, really? And so, to some degree, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So you can generate any one of those at any time depending on what
format you want to present it. But, interestingly enough for all the talk of, hey, all these apps go. Take even our good old IDEs, in some sense IDEs are back, right? Whether it's Excel or VS Code. Because the reality is
AI generates output, I need to make sense of that output. In fact, I need a fantastic editor</p>
<p>that lets me do diffs and
iterations on it with AI. So I think the IDE, I think in fact one of the most exciting things is new classes of highly refined IDEs that have even a sort of a telemetry loop with the intelligence layer, but also they kind of act more like
heads up displays, right? I have thousands of agents going off. How am I going to make sense of the micro steering
of thousands of agents. And that is what IDEs/inboxes</p>
<p>and messaging tools will be, right? Which is, I'm not messaging one, you know, or dealing with triage the
way I deal with it today, but it's going to be different. Okay, interesting. So you think right now programmers spend all
their time in an IDE, but they're one of the few
professions that does that. And your vision is the accountant IDE, the lawyer IDE, and— What is the metaphor of how I will work with agents, right? So it's kind of like massive
macro delegation, right? So there's lots of agents I go give a bunch of
instructions to and they go off and work sometimes for hours,
days, let's say, you know,</p>
<p>as the models get better,
but they are checking in and so it's macro
delegation, micro steering. So if you take that, how does one do micro
steering with context, right? It can't come back like my... It can't be in the next
notification hell, right? Which is, it sort of notifies me. It has like five words. I don't know exactly
what the real context is or what have you. That I think is where, and that has to be multi app like, right? So that's where I feel
like all software finally, when it grows up, it looks like an inbox</p>
<p>and a messaging tool and a canvas with a blinking screen. Except this time around a
lot of work got, you know, went and happened. Is that one app, is
that 10 different apps? Like, it's kind of interesting if you think about the
productivity suite that emerged, there was, you know, three big apps in Word,
Excel, and PowerPoint.</p>
<p><strong>[18:09]</strong></p>
<p>But it's interesting that that number was not 1 and was not 40, it was 3. And so how do you think about this in the— I think that that's right. I mean, to me, it will be a few, I think. And in fact, the reductionist, you know, in me, it says, "Man,
they'll be the same things." Except the job they do
is going to be different because I think, you know, a table, at least at
the human level, right? Because we can all talk about, like what tools will agents use to communicate with each other, right? That's a different thing, right? Right now for the RL loop,</p>
<p>they are simulating our
production environment, but they will ultimately be more efficient in creating their own
production environments to kind of RL themselves, so... But let's just leave that aside. But in order to communicate with us, I feel like we have discovered some good things that we like. We like spreadsheets and tables and we like documents
in sort of linear form. We like inboxes or messaging tools. So these are like reasonable UIs, except the question I think you asked</p>
<p>is how does this thing
have, when it shows up in an IDE with like a set of changes, you have to help me more
than just say, "Okay, now here is a file, go to that file." Like, that directed plan,
not just to execute, but for me to do my workflow. And like, one of the things that we are experimenting with is mission control and
GitHub Copilot is that. The idea is you go have
five, six different branches in which you fire off all
these autonomous agents. They all do their work, they come back</p>
<p>and then your ability to do PR triage is where I think the next IDE is born. I'm struck by in technology how frequently you see the
pattern of excitement for, and a vision around a
technology being so much earlier than the technology actually being ready. Like the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey," which is in the '60s, like that was a voice activated AI with tool use, you know, capabilities. It's true.
And, you know, it just took 50 years</p>
<p>and then, you know, people
were excited about the idea that you could speak to
your computer and, you know, text to speech, speech to text. People were excited
about that in the '80s. And like only now, I don't
know if you use superwhisper or anything like that, but
it's finally really good. But like it wasn't good
three years ago, you know, 40 years after the vision. Yeah, it's crazy that you bring that up. In fact, I used to have an apartment right next to the Microsoft
campus, that old campus, and I was working on
Interactive Television. This was in '94. The information superhighway.</p>
<p>That's right. You know, and there were multiple
things that were stunning. My management chain was
Rick Rashid and, you know, who reported to Craig Mundie, who reported to Nathan Myhrvold and there was Bill Gates and I was saying, "Man,
that's a lot of IQ . And of course we all missed the internet. That was the only thing that happened. But I had interactive television, switched ATM, I think, to
my home in my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>[21:11]</strong></p>
<p>So I remember doing this demo, one of the high stakes things I did as a young guy at Microsoft was a demo of our first
redundant file system, which was a video server where John Malone was the one who came and Bill was sort of saying, "Hey, here's the future of
interactive television." And guess what? It's even great because
the disc can go, you know, haywire and still stream. And so my job was to remove the disc drive and have the stream continue. But we built essentially
a distributed file system and a streaming server</p>
<p>and had an ATM switch
network to the house. And I had like five movies I could watch. And I watched them all multiple times. Okay, so I want to ask you about this, 'cause I've thought a lot about this and you're the perfect person to ask, which is, Microsoft
saw the internet future that was coming in the '90s, and in particular the famous Bill Gates Internet Tidal Wave memo said, "The internet is the one big thing Microsoft needs to focus on." It wasn't like, "We're not
thinking about the internet." It wasn't that it was
priority number 7 of 15.</p>
<p>It was like, "Hey, guys, listen up. The only thing Microsoft
should be thinking about is the internet." But the vision for the
internet at the time was this information superhighway, which was subtly different
from the internet because the thinking was, and
it was very sensible thinking, no one has internet to the
computer in their home. Like, a lot of people don't
have a computer in their home. So what people do have is a TV and what they have is cable, which is a high bandwidth connection. And so we're going to do
these set top boxes on the TV and that is how people
will use the internet. Like, paying a huge amount of
attention to this coming wave.</p>
<p>Pretty sensible, well
thought out solution, and yet not the right approach. And so obviously bring that up in the context of the giant AI. Like, what should one take away from that? It's great one. See, if I look at even my interpretation, it'll be actually interesting. I've not spent as much time
talking to Bill about that era. But I felt there were at least... As someone, as a sort of
an entry level employee at that time even, my reading of history was that we kind of got the internet, but we didn't.</p>
<p>Because we wanted to deliver,
remember the quality... Like, I don't think we believed
that TCP/IP would work. I mean, at some level
the information highway, when I look at what we were trying to do was, man, this quality
of service is a thing. This TCP/IP just is not going to work. And so therefore we were
competing against AOL, on dial up and even that sort of... You remember like MSN was an X.25 network. Yes, yes.
The first version of it. Yes.
And so then...</p>
<p>But that's when Bill like pivoted, right? So the thing that Bill
did was in '95, I guess... In fact, it's funny that, right, Windows 95 was launching, and then he says, "You know what?" It's all going to change." So I feel between '92, which is when I think all of us, maybe who'd got our first demo, right, '93, November is when Mosaic...</p>
<p><strong>[24:12]</strong></p>
<p>Right?
Yeah, that's right. I think something like that. And so we all, you know, were kind of dancing around it. So from '93 to '95, there was that two year
period where it was unclear whether this was going to be the protocol and the stack emerged. And by '95 it was clear,
and then we pivoted. Interesting. Okay, so just at that time
it wasn't actually clear that the open internet would win. Yes. And in fact, there's
one more lesson that... You know, the interesting
thing that I've always watched, and because I think we
can parlay this into AI,</p>
<p>one is to get the paradigm right. Then, it's not clear, even if
you get the paradigm right, that you may not get
what is the killer app or even the business model, like, that's always been the case, right? Which is, you know, with the internet, who would've thought that, you know, for the open web, an organizing layer would be one proprietor or one network effect
search engine, right? Because the organizing layer of the web, you know, I always say
like, "There's no such thing as the open web, there's the Google web."</p>
<p>And just because they just dominated it. Should one reflect on the fact that maybe there was
some motivated thinking around our proprietary solution, you know, the Liberty Media, Microsoft
joint venture will win? Whereas the open web is what won and you should maybe caution organizations where if they're following
two possibilities, you know, our information superhighway
proprietary system</p>
<p>or the open web, companies will somehow have happy thinking towards
the proprietary solution. It's an interesting one,
I think the way, you know, when I look back again,
it's interesting, right? So AOL and MSN kind of, you know, lost out, let's call it, to the open web, except they were replaced
by new forms of AOL and MSN. They're called search engines. They're called app stores. Like, the mobile web
in fact is fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, the open web was
a moment in history. A moment in history, and then... And so the thing that,
maybe the meta thing for me is organizing layers will always emerge even in an open ecosystem and a lot of the category power moves to that organizing layer. And it's always unclear,
like the last paradigm or this last time it was search engines, today it's chat bots. How long lasting is that? No one knows, but it's definitely, today, I mean, ChatGPT's
success cannot be denied in terms of what it means
as an aggregation point.</p>
<p>Marketplaces/app stores have been a thing. What comes next, you know? What happens to e-commerce in an agentic marketplace
or an agent e-commerce? I think these are the interesting things that need to be litigated. Well, I want to talk about that and I want to talk about
commerce, but actually first, while we're on the topic of,
while we're still in the '90s, everyone is making comparisons to the dot-com bubble right
now, it's almost a cliche.</p>
<p><strong>[27:14]</strong></p>
<p>And I think it's actually
a reasonable comparison. You know, it's a cliche for a reason, which is, it is a very
CapEx intensive build out for a new paradigm that
is in fact a big deal and yet there's an awful lot of CapEx. You were there at Microsoft
during the 2000 dot-com bubble and it really was, you know, Microsoft's share price peaked in the late '90s, early 2000s, and then didn't surpass it
until 2016, I want to say. What did it feel like in 1999?</p>
<p>In particular, did you
know you were in a bubble? Or was it like, "Oh, this
time it's different." It's interesting. Yeah. Yeah, in fact, I remember,
I think, you know, we probably became the largest
market cap company in 2000, we crossed GE, I remember that. Yeah, we were capital-light,
let's say, right? That time around, it was like... I guess I was more like Sam at that time, which is somebody else's
capital was being spent. It is, quite honestly,
when I look back at it, at that time too, the
financial cycle aside,</p>
<p>it was clear, the secular trend was clear that this is going to. Because even by then, the business models were also emerging. Even for Microsoft, the
biggest lesson at that time was, oh, my God, like
even our first order play, or, oh, we got to build a browser, we got to build a web server. We've got to, you know, have
internet protocols everywhere. You know, we had a website builder</p>
<p>inside of office with front page. We did all the obvious things, but we realized that just
doing the obvious things didn't make sense. We needed to reinvent what we were doing, plus what are the new
business models, was clear. So in an interesting way, that cycle kind of came out of nowhere. I mean, it came out of, you
know, what was just, you know, whatever rational
exuberance or what have you, but the correction in some sense washed away a bunch of stuff. But I would say the ideas persisted.</p>
<p>Totally.
Right? And so, to me, I think
about what's happening here. I mean, there are two things, right? The infrastructure itself
that's getting laid out, I think it's got a lot more immediate. Like, it's not like even the,
you know, the gestation period of okay, I built up, you know, dark fiber, and you know, some internet
company will first scale to a billion users and use. This time—
There are lines out the door to buy this stuff. Exactly, and so this time around, quite frankly, we are behind, right? Like when I look at our
infrastructure build, right,</p>
<p>and demand today. That's the thing that when people say it's all a, you know, there's a bubble. Like, when I look at my
earnings, I can have... Like, I mean, that was the last time I was so supply
constrained on PowerShells. I haven't heard that comparison before, which is, let's not forget
that the dot-com bubble, which again was a telecoms bubble, it was a fiber bubble in a big way.</p>
<p><strong>[30:15]</strong></p>
<p>Like, it was dark fiber,
the clue's in the name, it was dark, it was not lit up yet. And this is anything but dark fiber. Yeah, it's not like any
one of us is sitting there and saying, "Hey, I have
all the GPUs wired up and nobody's using them." I don't have a utilization problem. I may have a PUE, like, I mean, I want higher utilization because it's mostly because
it's memory bottleneck or what have you, but
that is a different... But like there is not a thing that I have that's not sold out. In fact, my problem is I
got to bring more supply. And in that, will we perfectly get it? No one does, right?</p>
<p>There's no supply chain operation that perfectly matches demand and supply. But this time around
the build out, you know, given the long lead, like for example, one of the things we study a lot is, even when we talk about our capital, we try to describe it even to the Street. Hey, you got to remember these assets. Some of these assets are 20 years. Some of these things are
four years or five years. And in fact you kind of
have to make the decisions on those things differently, right? Having a cold shell that's
unused is nothing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. it's kind of like having
a campus with five buildings. It's not sort of going to be a problem on Microsoft's balance sheet. What is a real problem would be, hey, not having warm shells that we can kind of light up. Where is the bottleneck these days? Like, is it electricians, is it shells? Is it turbines.
Yeah, I mean, so... Yeah, the product that is the bottleneck is just a bunch of powered up shells. So if I don't have enough
shells that are powered,</p>
<p>that I can then roll in my racks and then make them operational. And that's the long lead part, right? Which is you kind of have
to have the land permits, the power permits, get
all that done in time. And by the way, location, right? So I think one of the
things that's glossed over, of course stateside, United
States, we are building a lot, but we have to build all over the world. And there are data regulations,
in fact, more every day. People care about sovereignty
in a major, major way.</p>
<p>And so therefore for
us, we have to make sure that the fleet is a global fleet, a fleet that kind of can deal
with all types of workloads, training to DataGen, to inference. And so it's sort of a
complex, multi-variable thing. Who should care about data sovereignty? Where, you know, Ireland
has a bunch of data centers but is not particularly wound
up on the idea that, you know, data should only be in Ireland. And I don't think it
should be super wound up about that fact, but, well, I guess,</p>
<p>do you guys just go with
whatever the country wants or do you try to advise on whether you should want
data sovereignty or not, and who should? Yeah, so I think it's obviously
a topic that's top of mind for pretty much every country, every policy maker, and they care. And there's obviously
real legitimate reasons. The thing that I would say, in the AI age,</p>
<p><strong>[33:17]</strong></p>
<p>I'm now thinking a little bit differently even about sovereignty. What I mean by that is the
ultimate sovereignty question is more of what's the future
of a corporation, right? Like, I mean, if you sort
of start by, you know, if you go to the core
of the Coase theorem, you say, "Wow, what the heck? You know, if the model is the
thing that knows everything, why do I even... Like, I'm supposed to
have some tacit knowledge that makes the transactional
costs inside my organization lower than just being in the marketplace." So that's a mind bender.</p>
<p>So in fact, one of the ways I think is the sovereignty that matters is your company's sovereignty in a age where there
are continual learning, increasing returns to a model. So I'm increasingly thinking
that hey, company's ability to have that intelligence
layer that's a scaffold or even weights embedded in the model. Like, so it's not somebody
else's foundation model. It's about do you have sovereignty
in your foundation model? So my new concept is
the future of a company is that company has its
own foundation model</p>
<p>that captures essentially
that passive knowledge that makes the transactional costs of how knowledge gets accrued and diffused inside the organization faster. So that's sort of a long
speech on sovereignty. Well, there's two versions of... That's very interesting, the idea that AI maybe just changes the
nature of companies. And you are saying that if companies, some companies are already
collections of IP, right?</p>
<p>You know, Disney, we just had Dave Ricks from Eli Lilly here, that is
an IP company in a big way. And some companies are
already collections of IP. But right now that IP is in
all the emails and documents and people's heads most importantly. Whereas maybe the IP could be
in a single model over time. Where I thought you were
going to go with that is just maybe the, you
know, people point out a lot that current companies are
modeled after, you know,</p>
<p>manufacturing companies and
Alfred Sloan type stuff, despite the fact that, you know, we're doing knowledge work today and not running a little
manufacturing line. And do you get more just
weird looking companies, do you get the, you know, the famous, really tiny billion dollar company? Do you get more highly
distributed internet companies? Do you get some DAOs? I thought that's where
you're going to go with that. I think that those are also possibilities. So the structure itself could change and it's going to be more
possible for, you know, whatever the few, you know, the one person billion dollar
company, what have you, right?</p>
<p>Make that happen or DAOs could happen. But the interesting
question, at least for me is, where does tacit knowledge reside, right? Clearly it resides in people's heads and it's the classic knowhow
that accrues in compounds. I think it will also reside and compound as weights in some LoRA layer</p>
<p><strong>[36:22]</strong></p>
<p>that is unique to your company. So that's kind of my... So in fact, I feel like, hey, you know, the new intellectual property
at Eli Lilly or at Microsoft or at Stripe at some point can be also be besides all the humans, besides all the other artifacts we have, I think we'll also say, "Oh,
they are in some embedding." Yes. Well, okay. It's funny you say this because Stripe, Stripe is interesting
'cause it does not really have strong network effects as a company. You know, when we started
building up Stripe,</p>
<p>it was very much a single
player API experience and we make it easy to start using Stripe, but ultimately you'd never know that anyone else was using Stripe. What's happened as we've scaled up is we now just have a trust network where we can prevent fraud
by virtue of the fact that we've seen most internet users. And so we have a knowledge for
what good and bad looks like. And even the fact that we
haven't seen you before is inherently a little bit suspicious because we've seen most people and so it becomes a reputation network,</p>
<p>kind like reCAPTCHA for Google simply became kind of
a reputation network. Anyway, what we're now doing is training a payments foundation model where we're using all
the data that we have in the Stripe network and you have a much
larger, more capable model taking into account... So anyway, we are trying to
do exactly what you're saying. And so one of the questions for all of us, then how do you protect that from sort of essentially leaking over to the base foundation model? Is it just like one capability hop away because it learned how to
even do fraud detection?</p>
<p>Is it just some other
multidimensional or not? And that I think is the
key question, right? To me, I think, there
are two arguments, right? One argument is it's that, you know, argument that, hey, the models
are going to eat the world. You can kind of easily see, oh yeah, after all, everything is just a pattern and I'll learn it all
and what have you, so. But then the thing though is, you could, to your point about Stripe can take multiple models, build this unbelievable
sort of, I'll call it fraud detection layer that
is, you know, model forward.</p>
<p>And then there is this
memory and tools use and action space that's
all unique to Stripe. That to me is the future of a corporation. Whether it's a pharma
company, a payments company, or a software company. That I think is the work
that we all are doing and will do, and I think
that that's, to me, that is sovereignty, right? Alright. Oh, man.</p>
<p>Alright. Woo. Wow. Okay, this could be a new high score. And 4, 74. So, new high score.
There you go. I'm still thinking about this discussion we're having about the IDE for people who
aren't software engineers. And again, I feel like
there could be a product</p>
<p><strong>[39:23]</strong></p>
<p>in the next 10 years for finance people where, in hindsight, it is
obviously the correct UI, but just like the spreadsheet kind of came out of nowhere as a UI, it may feel like it came
out of nowhere at that time. I'm really struck by that. Speaking of the spreadsheet, it's like a rite of passage
for certain software companies to try to take on Excel and it's seems to be doing pretty well 40 years in or what have you. Why is it so durable? Yeah, it's unbelievable, right? I mean, at some level, you know,</p>
<p>the idea that a tabular for... I mean, I think it's the
power of lists and tables. It's just a perfect, and the malleability of software, right? That was I think the combination. So I think that's where the,
what's the durability of a, that's why a blinking canvas, right? It's sort of like it's
always going to be there. We may add lots of bells
and whistles to it. And the same thing with spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The other thing about the spreadsheet is, it's Turing complete, right? I mean, that's the other, you know, Yeah, We sort of don't
give it enough credit. It's like I can make it do everything.
I think it's the world's most approachable programming environment. 100%, I mean, it's kind of like, you know, and you get into it without
even thinking your programming. And that is the other beauty, right? Which is like, you know, like
AI still, we're mystified it. You and I talked about, oh, my God, we need change management. When spreadsheets came, nobody talked about change management. They were just using it. And that to me is the
other thing which is...</p>
<p>You know, like somebody
was describing to me, I was meeting the CEO of Generality, he joined Generality
during the fax machine era and he was managing all
their insurance agents and he said to me like, "Look, I still remember the day
when emails showed up, Excel showed up and the entire workflow of how things happen
completely were upended and evolved and changed ground up." And so to me, I think that
that's, to your point, what are those things of
this era that will discover,</p>
<p>that'll allow the ground up
relitigation of the work, the work artifact and the workflow. It's such an interesting
time to be in software. I mean, compared to, you must feel this, like, it's just a much
more interesting time now than 5 or 10 years ago. You know, it is interesting, right? Which is what happened was
we were like, you know, Cloud, Cloud, Cloud. And, you know, if you had to ask me what is the hottest
thing in, you know, 2019, we had built this fantastic multi region or regionless database that
was multi-format, right</p>
<p>Cosmos DB, which was like,
ah, we had, you know, basically a JSON database. We had a SQL in there, it was the everything
database and we were thinking, oh, and it's regionless
and blah, blah, blah. And then the pandemic happened and then Cloud went into
another hyper drive.</p>
<p><strong>[42:23]</strong></p>
<p>I mean, Teams, thank God,
just became like the thing. So that was the exciting thing, and lo and behold, you come out of it and you sort of say, "Oh, I
thought, oh, after the pandemic we're going to get to some stable state." In fact, I remember a forecast
of the Cloud, you know, we were saying, "What do we do? We overbuilt during the pandemic," and there was a good eight months where we were, "Oh, what..." And then this thing now has come to. There's a lot of charts
of the shape at Stripe.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was
this way at Microsoft, where obviously March 2020 you saw this discontinuity, right? Much more eCommerce activity happening and we saw the rate of
online business creation. 'Cause, you know, you had
businesses that were offline only saying, "Oh, you know, we got
to switch to selling online." And it just stayed at that
elevated level forever obviously since, it's gone up from there. But there was no matching decline as people went back to, you know, into physical offices
and things like that. It was just a step change and then it stayed at the
elevated level forever. I'm sure you saw some of the things</p>
<p>in Azure and things like that.
Yeah, 100%. It never came down. We're talking about
commerce, so we might as well talk about what we're working on together. So we are very excited about it. I mean, I think the idea that
has always been there is, which is what's the best way for a merchant friendly set of rails and what is a customer
friendly set of rails, right? Is there a perfect matching? Conversational sort of commerce is a thing that people have talked about. And now I think with the
work that you all have done</p>
<p>and others have done, we kind of can really bring
the merchant and the end user and have this agentic sort of experience. So it's early days, it
has to be tastefully done, it has to be done in a way
that you earn the user's trust. And so I'm very excited about it. Yeah, we see two differences here because there have been
previous attempts as, you know, buying on Twitter, buying on Instagram and, you know, these kinds of things. But what's different
here is one, you have AI, so all the integrations for
the merchant are much easier.</p>
<p>It's much less of a
lift than previous times when things like that
just have been tried. But then secondly, I
just think the experience is so compelling as an end user. We're already seeing
this in the early data from the super early
customers that we have. You know, we launched a few
weeks back in ChatGPT as well that just, it has to work. And again, the data's
already bearing that out, because it's so much
easier as an end customer. Yeah, I've been talking
about it like, you know,</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a cricket nut so I kind of, I'm always searching for
something and, you know, the problem is, you know, whether it's Amazon or
Walmart or what have you, the search experience
sometimes is hard on the site. So interestingly enough, these chat experiences
first are fantastic, right? And the fact that they
point back to the catalog, I mean, the catalog is still king. But now if I can marry the
checkout and the catalog</p>
<p><strong>[45:25]</strong></p>
<p>and that to me is where
I think the seamlessness. Well, and do you have any experiences, I've found versions of this, I'm curious if you've had experiences where for product research, using an AI app is so much better than, you know, keyword based search. It's amazing that up to last year we thought keyword based
search was an acceptable way to hunt for anything.
Yeah, in fact, that's... Yeah, and the seller, like the bottom line is it's kind of like it is creating a custom catalog for you, right? I mean, the response is
not like a SERP, right? No, we were buying furniture in our house</p>
<p>and we were just saying, "Oh, yeah, we have this much space
available in this spot. What do you think is a
good, you know, piece that would look good in that spot that meets these dimensions,"
and things like that. But it's crazy that we weren't doing that previously, you know what I mean? And so all this kind of customization, being able to give vibes,
general aesthetics, "I'm looking for like
something slightly higher end but not super fancy." You know, it's crazy that
you weren't able to... By the way, that's just the
other crazy, crazy thing. I know my wife's who's an architect</p>
<p>and so she sort of has
this notebook, you know, Copilot notebook in
which she has all these architectural pictures and so on. And you can ask it quite high
level reasoning questions on what I should put in there. It's able to take an architectural sketch, a drawing, and then take a
public catalog of furniture and put those things
together and reason about it. And that type of stuff is pretty magical. Like, our view on this,
we are, as you know, really AI pilled when it
comes to commerce at Stripe. And we think a huge amount will move here.</p>
<p>And all the merchant
conversations we're having are bearing that out. And the way I think about it is that if you are doing
open-ended discovery, "Oh, I'm interested in an
outfit to buy for this occasion, don't know exactly what I want," AI will be so much better
at helping you with that than the current
experiences where, you know, you're clicking through
a list of search results or something like that. And then if you're doing targeted search where I'm looking for a specific object that meets these needs, "I want this component for my bike." Then also being able to specify with AI</p>
<p>the exact parameters
of the search you have, will be much better. You're like, "Wait, if you're taking all of the undirected discovery and if you're also taking all
of the highly directed search, isn't that just like all the commerce that happens on the internet?" I think the only thing that's left that's out of that is
like recurring staples. "I need to order more pet food." That feels to me like the least affected. Though, of course you
have to discover the brand of pet food at some point originally. But yeah, that's kind of
how we're thinking about it. And again, Etsy has been
an awesome first partner</p>
<p>because all the products
are custom, right? There's no... Yeah, that makes a ton of sense to me. I mean, the discovery part, which obviously people like Instagram and others have done a great job. So the question is what's
the discovery layer. We have, like, that's
one of the, you know, obviously personalized
discovery layer inspiration</p>
<p><strong>[48:27]</strong></p>
<p>for a product, you know, what Pinterest has done is interesting. So some layer like that married with this
conversational interface. Well, and of course it'll be a rising tide that lifts all boats where part of what we're doing with this is making merchant's product
catalogs remotely discoverable and inventory and everything like that. And then remotely purchasable where you don't necessarily have to go through the
whole flow on their side and everything like that. You can just do it inside the
magic wand Copilot experience. And so that is at like the
raw nuts and bolts level what we are doing and
what we're wiring up.</p>
<p>I think then what's
exciting is that, again, Pinterest played with commerce
quite a few years back, maybe 10 years back. It hasn't taken off as a huge thing. But now if you have all the merchants who are offering their product catalogs as part of this protocol, then
social sites like, you know, Pinterest and Instagram and Twitter get another run at this
kind of commerce experience because you've way more merchant
support and adoption for it than you had the first time around. Yeah, and we have a
project called the NLWeb and the idea is that,</p>
<p>and which is to really take
every catalog of every merchant and give it like essentially a website, an NLWeb interface, that then an agent can talk
to, to be able to interrogate and get the deep search, so to speak. Yes, yes, yes.
Because today in some sense, one of the biggest challenges
is the quality of the catalog and the ability to use
reasoning to do a deep search. And if you can solve
that, then to your point, every product will find its query. Yes, so we're building out this platform</p>
<p>in agentic commerce
where we have, you know, some open source protocols like our agentic commerce protocol. We obviously have the regular
Stripe products, you know, people are using us for, you know, and it's particularly kind of tricky from a payments point of view because you're looking to have an AI app do payments on behalf of other people across all these
different sites on the web without probably sharing
all your payment details like all across the web. It's interesting payment
things that we're doing. Anyway, we're looking to
build a platform business in agentic commerce.</p>
<p>You guys seem to know a thing or two. What advice would you have for us as we build in this very nascent space, but when there clearly
is product market fit? I mean, I think... I mean, you have done that, right? Which is one of the things that I would think is what does it mean to participate in this
agentic workflow, right? For every merchant, right? Like, so every merchant now will have to sort of come
to someone like Stripe and say, "Hey, I have a
catalog, I have a checkout, please get me to meet agents," in the most friction-free way.</p>
<p>And that's done tastefully is why I would think I would hire Stripe for. And I think the merchant onboarding, because I'm assuming the
long tail of merchants being able to click and say, "Hey, enable me for agentic commerce," is going to be the thing
that's going to drive. Because the good news here is
there is going to be multiple, I mean, obviously ChatGPT is the big one,</p>
<p><strong>[51:29]</strong></p>
<p>but there's going to be, I mean, you know, Google's going to be there,
we're going to be there, Meta will be there, Perplexity, there's going to be a lot of competition. There's going to be a lot of front doors as aggregators.
Yes. But the more interesting
thing is they themselves, will on their website
or on their mobile app, will want to support
natural language queries. And so all of that being enabled for, or my own agents will go
interrogate those things. So I think that that's the key thing to be challenged, you know,
or rather really solve well. Because going to a small merchant</p>
<p>and saying, "Hey, you go
stand up an MCP server, do this protocol, that protocol,"
what's the easy button? I think the other thing
that's we're going to see is, and you're probably seeing this already, a merging of a bunch of
the agentic experiences. So we're talking about
agentic commerce here. And we had Des Traynor from Intercom, they're now doing customer
service AI mediated and just like replacing humans, doing customer service with AI. But what they're seeing obviously is a huge amount of induced demand where people initially come
for the help desk type queries and it's like, "Wow, this is
honestly a much better way</p>
<p>to navigate the website." And it's almost like a command line for... Anyway, it can't quite
take as much actions now as it will be able to. But I also wonder how much
all these experiences merge where like, we're doing
the buying stuff over here that is growing and
expanding and, you know, maybe there's some discovery
and things like that. They're doing the customer
service stuff over there. It's universal. Yeah, that's a good point. When does it become a
command-line application? Like, again, my example of this is I find the fashion space interesting where, how incredibly poor the tech is with a lot of websites out
there where people are trying</p>
<p>to do this very aesthetic vibe space. "I'm looking for something like that, but like a little more
fancy," you know, whatever. And it's all keyword based search and manual tagging and things like that. And things like that feel
to me perfectly set up for having an interactive AI
based experience where, again, like your Midjourney prompts, you're like, "No, the
image wasn't quite right. Change it in this way." Just doing that with commerce, I think, will be really interesting.
Makes sense. And I also think intuitively
like, I mean, all of us our inside sales is also,
or rather customer service is also inside sales.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And so intuitively that
makes sense, you know, and definitely in the agentic world, you can stitch these things together so that the seams are not
like to what they are today. Maybe what we're describing is a bunch of swim lanes
have been established by random accidents of
software and org charts and everything like that. You do customer service,
when people come with a query is of a non-commercial
nature, you are an SDR. That's right.
You know, you do whatever.</p>
<p>And all those distinctions are probably going to get thrown away. We're talking lot about kind
of the AI apps that people use and Copilot and ChatGPT and Gemini and all these kind of things. There's a debate about how
much model quality matters and is it the case that people
pick a brand and, you know, they've been drinking, you
know, Coke for the longest time</p>
<p><strong>[54:30]</strong></p>
<p>and even if Coke's, I
mean, Coke's a bad example, because there was a revolt
about the change in the formula. But, you know, even if they
change the formula, you know, people, they still have a preferred brand. You know, I use o3, my wife uses GPT-5. I'm always horrified
'cause I'm like, you know, "You deserve more intelligence than that." And, you know, you can take
o3 from my cold, dead hands. Where do you stand on the debate of do people have loyalty to it? And there was also the revolt when they tried to take away 4.0, was it?
Yeah, that's right. And people were really
attached to that model. Do people have loyalty to a model or do they have loyalty to an AI brand? And how does this affect
your business strategy? I think that in the consumer products,</p>
<p>this was the first time
we saw that, right? When you changed models, they're
not sort of uniform changes and they impact people differently, right? And personality is one such thing or style or what have you. And so it just sort of is a new dimension. So in other words, it's also an argument that, "Oh, wow, this is a new dimension of perhaps differentiation," right? People will, you know,</p>
<p>it's sort of, there's the IQ side of it, there's the EQ side of it, and then there is all these style points. And maybe that's kind of one of the things that people will steer things towards. But long term, for me, I think you have to kind of make sure that the models are most capable for the hardest high value tasks. And then you continuously optimize, after you have access to that, for what the task had had is, right? So as a product builder for us,</p>
<p>and my thing is have the model drop which is the most capable, but then what's in production
is multiple models. And my favorite, like, new
thing in GitHub for example, is auto, which is I
want to keep, you know, people still obviously
love sonnet whatever, they want to use it. But at the end of the day, I
really want the model picker and it just can't be a
dumb model router, right? It has to basically have the intelligence to know that this task
deserves this kind of cogs</p>
<p>or this type of intelligence and this is my complexity
of my repo or my PR task. That ultimately is where, you know, the future of agents would be, right? And so therefore you want the model, in fact, you want an ensemble of models that then, you know, you have agents intermediating that ensemble
so that it meets your needs. And then you'll have preferences. Will everyone's preference not just be for more intelligence?</p>
<p>Like, I'll go into the
picker and manually select o3 for like, "where should I
go get ice cream" query? Like I always want the most— That's habit, don't you think? But that is, you know—
Maybe. But it's also an important
considered decision. But it is true. I mean, like, it's very hard for any of us to take our, that's why defaults matter and we love our defaults. We don't love the cheese to be moved. You know, even the model
selection stuff, you know,</p>
<p><strong>[57:31]</strong></p>
<p>it's kind of like, wow, if you now took away the
model selection, you know, it's a problem and so therefore
you got to be careful. But I do think in the
long run, if I can trust, that's another one, right? Which is if I can trust something to always do something for me
while it's making a selection that somehow is delightful, then that's when I'll hand off. Okay, and so you think that's
what you need to get to, is me trusting that you'll
pick an appropriate model? Exactly.
Yeah. Yeah. And then, I mean, my
mental model of Microsoft is that you just play at
every part of the stack</p>
<p>in that there's the, you know, you have Copilot, you
have your stake in OpenAI, you have, well, we can get to
vertical applications in AI. You have the Azure layer,
you have chips, everything. I leaving out a whole bunch of stuff. Are some more important
to you than others? What is the must win? Will you do verticals? Yeah, I mean, at some level—
What's the nuance to that? Yeah, well, at the core, the way I kind of conceptualize it is our infrastructure business. We have to be fantastic at building what I'll call the token factory, right? This is the tokens per dollar per watt.</p>
<p>Really being super efficient in that. Then I'll say we have another layer of it, which is the agent factory. And the difference
between the token factory and the agent factory is use
the tokens most efficiently to drive a business outcome, or a consumer preference
outcome, which is about— That's the value per token or something? Yeah, the value per token. And as evaled by sort
of the specific domain that people care about. And that is, to your point,
it has tooling around it. It has a whole host.</p>
<p>It's kind of the new app tier or the app server, right? Every new platform has always had, there was the web and
there was a web server. This is the AI server in
some sense, or the AI cloud. Then we will definitely
want to build our own, I'll call it systems of
intelligence or AI systems, that is the family of Copilot, right? Whether it's for information work, that's kind of what we have done. For coding or software development, that's the GitHub Copilot. Security's another domain where we are absolutely
going to be a primary. Those would be the three horizontal.</p>
<p>We will also have business applications. The other one that is, we're doing a lot in health and science. So in health the, you
know, we had bought nuance and now we have something
called DAX Copilot and this is the notetaking diarization for physicians, right. So the ability to be able to have a doctor spend more time with their patients and then the AI do everything else in terms of everything from
coding to taking the notes. So that's one place we are, you know, have a great close partnership with Epic.</p>
<p>It's embedded part of Epic. So that's kind of what
we are doing in health. And then we are also
doing stuff in Copilot for consumer health that
sort of docks to it. But the other one is science. And the science, it turns
out it's a big domain for what I'll call the outer
loop orchestration, right? Which is the scientific
method in some sense requires you to create the hypothesis,</p>
<p><strong>[60:33]</strong></p>
<p>then run these multiple
experiments in silico, come back, refine and so on. So that to me is another tool chain. It's kind of like we're trying
to discover some combination of the GitHub Copilot meets Microsoft 365 Knowledge work, if you will, for the scientist where they have the authoritative
sources of knowledge. They have even the interfaces tools used could even be, hey, the MCP server for the wet labs, so to speak.</p>
<p>Can I interface with it? And then how do you
orchestrate all of this such that the scientific
loop can go faster. As a platform company,
you always have decisions around when should you try
and bundle products together, when should you try and staple them and mandate they be used
together and when should you not. And, you know, I think the classic example for some reason that everyone talks about, despite it being quite minor, is the fact that Apple originally only let you use an iPod with a Mac</p>
<p>and try to use it to drive Mac sales and then gave up and, you know, shipped iTunes for Windows. And my understanding reading
the "Apple in China" book is it was like a totally random decision that someone just made
it, you know, one day. But it's often held up
as one of these examples. Obviously Microsoft, the entire history is full of these interesting examples. I don't think people realize
how open Microsoft was in the early days where in 1985 most of Microsoft's revenue was
from Macintosh applications. And then for the Microsoft
operating systems,</p>
<p>most of the applications
were third party, you know, like Lotus 1-2-3 and things like this. And so it was like a fully open strategy. And then you had the Windows
era of the tight coupling between Office and Windows and those kind of mutually
reinforcing each other. Then early on, I get the sense Azure and Cloud was, you know, oh, it's a place you
can run your SQL server. And then fully embracing Linux later on and things like that. I'm curious just to, 'cause again, we think about this as a platform company and we've been of late
embracing much more modularity</p>
<p>where Stripe Radar, you can use it even if you're not using
Stripe for payments and things like that. How do you in general
think about your framework for when products should be coupled versus when you sell them independently? That's a great point.
And then, I have AI specific versions of that question. So the way I reason about it is, I think we overstate many times how many of these battles are
quote, unquote, "zero sum." So at some level, one of
the pieces of analysis that I think that you
want us to be sharp at is, what are by definition
going to be multiplayer.</p>
<p>Like Cloud is a classic example, right? Which is, I remember even back in the day when I got started, and obviously Azure got started much later than AWS, people would tell me, "Oh,
God, isn't AWS so far ahead?" Whereas is there a room
for a second Cloud? And having competed against Oracle and IBM on all the middle tier servers and so on, I felt like, no, this enterprise customer</p>
<p><strong>[63:34]</strong></p>
<p>and commercial customers by and large are going to demand sort of a multiple. And so that was the
structural understanding that drove us to even just be at it. And the rest is history. So a little bit of, to me,
if you over package things, you might in fact sort of reduce your TAM, and not compete. Like for example, if we built Azure, in fact Azure's, you know, we just called Windows Azure, right? Oh, well, that's a problem. Because Azure makes no
sense just for Windows. It's sort of got to support
Linux as first class.</p>
<p>It's got to support MySQL
and Postgres as first class. And so that's what sort
of allowed us to make sure that you have to actually have to do a great job with SQL Server. But you got to do as bang
of a job as like, you know, Amazon would do with Postgres or MySQL. And so it was driven primarily
by, hey, that's the TAM. That's what customers expect us. And we are going to
have tough competition. But, so to me that's kind of how I define my modularity, right? What's the thing</p>
<p>that maximizes my stack's
market opportunity, then yes, we are a firm, and the reason we we're
not a conglomerate. And so therefore there should be a theory of some integration benefits and platform effects. And so therefore, what is that and how do we do a great job of it? But each layer of the stack, right, even in, let's say
in Azure, the token factory, somebody should be able to come and say, "I just want to use Azure for its bare metal services. I just need Kubernetes, you
know, clustered all over, but I just need to you
to do the management part</p>
<p>and I'll bring all my software." No problem, we got to win that workload. Maybe then after that we'll
at least have a shot someday when it becomes a real pain to manage sort of your
multi-region database on your own that you'll say, "Oh,
let me just use Cosmos." But it's a separate decision. But isn't there always a debate between if we have Linux and
Azure, we'll sell more Azure. But then the Windows people say, "Yeah, but you're a hamstringing,
you know, Windows server." And there are some places
like you're describing where Microsoft's open, there
are other places, you know,</p>
<p>Microsoft Flight
Simulator is not available on the PlayStation, it's
available on the Xbox. And that makes sense, you
know, it feels kind of natural to be integrated that way. I know this might be a bit
of a stretch, but, you know, Teams Chat and Teams Video
are not sold separately. They're just part of one
thing, and that makes sense. It makes the bundle more compelling. And so don't you always
end up in these debates as to does the bundling cost
outweigh the bundling benefits? Yeah, and I think some of
those, like for example, Teams thing is, it's a classic one, which is Teams was born as a product that brought those four
things, like Outlook, right?</p>
<p>Outlook was brought, you
know, there was a PIM before, there was an email client and calendaring was separate. And Outlook was the first scaffolding that said, "Hey, we
bring these three things to get a job done," right? So that was, and same
thing with Teams, right? We brought chat and channels and video and what have you into one. So the bundling was the
product to some degree, right?</p>
<p><strong>[66:37]</strong></p>
<p>That was the product scaffolding. And so then of course
you can then say, "Hey, that needs to have an open marketplace and it needs to integrate
with other things," or what have you. So the modularity has
to be thought through in ways that make sense
at the atomic level. Then you don't want to
overthink about the synergies or sort of integration effects and you're not competitive, right? A classic thing would be if you built an unbelievable public cloud, except it only ran Windows
workloads or SQL workloads, that'll be essentially a very
small sliver of the market.</p>
<p>So it was in our sort of interest and definitely in the interest of meeting the customer needs. And so being able to sort of
really click in the AI stack, that's kind of how I look at it, right? We have an infra business, we
have an app server business, and we have an apps business. It's just simplifying. I want those three things to stand for them on their own merits. We ourselves of course want
to have the feedback loop across these three layers, but customers and partners will choose</p>
<p>which door they enter through. This impression I have is that when you took over Microsoft, you shifted the culture
from a highly bundled, you'll buy your Windows machines and they're running Microsoft Access and you know, they're a SQL server and everything is like
neatly packaged together in this Microsoft life to moving towards more of an open and
interoperable strategy. I think that the way I would say is my thing was to go back even to the Microsoft of the
'80s perhaps, right?</p>
<p>Because most of what happened
was really in the '90s there was Microsoft. and there was pretty much nothing else. And so there was sort of a lot more of our things coming together, whether it was on the
client or on the server. The '80s were like to your point, right? You know, we built Office on the Mac. Windows came later. In fact, the concept that Bill had when he started Microsoft
was it's a software factory. I'm not in love with any one category. I'm just like going to build
the best software factory</p>
<p>and it's going to churn out whatever, flight sim—
Interpreters. Flight sim, you want, you know, a basic interpreter. No problem, we have one. You want an operating
system, we have one too. So in some sense that was the idea. And at what point we got into a lock between four or five parts of
that, that became the Windows and Windows NT and client
server and what have you. And so I sort of realized that
when, you know, I became CEO and even when I was
running our Cloud business, that, hey, this is a time where, you know, the market's going to be a lot
bigger and a lot different.</p>
<p>And we didn't, like, we didn't
have the mobile platform at that time and so therefore
we really needed to make sure we would stay relevant
in the largest markets that we could address by bringing our products
together in configurations that made sense. So it is actually a lot more less dog... There was not that much dog... In fact, I would say, you know, if it was not in the
core DNA of the company, I don't think just because
I showed up as a CEO</p>
<p><strong>[69:38]</strong></p>
<p>and I said, "I want to do this,"
we would've executed well. It was in the core DNA of the company that we can in fact take our
software to every platform. Yes, speaking of the
core DNA of the company, there's the famous cartoon of, you know, Microsoft with all the guns
pointing at each other. How much cultural tweaking
did you have to do? And how do you actually do that when you get down to brass tacks? 'Cause you can see all the nice things, the all hands and things like that, but ultimately culture comes down to what you will and won't tolerate</p>
<p>and how decisions are
made and things like that. Yeah, I mean, I'd say there are two things that I learned from that entire episode because I always say, look, I'm a consummate insider, right? Anything good and bad about Microsoft of the last 35 years, I lived through them all
and I'm part of it, right? So I can't deny any of it. The thing that I felt
was, a little bit of that was just we lost our own belief because we lost the narrative. That cartoon is a great
example of someone else defining what became
the cultural narrative more so than reality, right?</p>
<p>The people started to
identify with the cartoon. That's right, I mean,
that's kind of one of the... I think that one of the fundamental issues of today's social media and the zeitgeist is you can absolutely lose narrative. It's reflexive
Yeah, it's completely reflexive. Like, so one of the interesting things is, of course all of these
things have signal, right? So this doesn't mean, oh, wow,
we were all perfect divisions and we were all sort of, you
know, in greater harmony. That is not the case. But you know, in some sense, some of these divisional
tensions are real issues that need to have tension, right?</p>
<p>You can't have... Like, social cohesion is not a goal, Winning in the marketplace is a goal, but at some level you have to orchestrate these large organizations. In fact, you may even
have two competing teams by design. And just because somebody
sort of said, "Hey, I'm going to read the New Yorker and there's going to be a cartoon," like, that's the type of stuff that I think leaders, and how to communicate in today's world where your employees
read about you outside</p>
<p>and form opinions about you is one of the toughest
leadership challenges, I think. Which is how do you earn the trust? How do you really make sure that they can in fact feel the
reality, shape the reality? Like the other thing is
everybody thinks it's the system. It's that guy at the
top or, you know, my VP and they have all the
power and I have none. The reality is the power
is a lot more diffused and distributed and so therefore</p>
<p>how do you really help people especially get hold of that and reshape. Like, you know, one of
the other famous things people say is, "Hey, I
never leave companies, I leave managers." And, you know, I believe that, right? And so it's kind of micro
cultures and they can be shaped.</p>
<p><strong>[72:38]</strong></p>
<p>In fact, when I look back
at my Microsoft career, I was lucky to fall into these people who created these
unbelievable environments in the company, right? And that's kind of why I stayed and that's how I thrived. And so to some degree, you know, I feel that the more culture... You need at the top, a narrative that you have to live
and be consistent, right? So that's where this growth mindset or learn-it-all versus know-it-all has been super helpful
for us as just a frame because nobody thinks of
it as my dogma, right? Thank God it's not, you know,</p>
<p>it's a well understood
child psychology thing that appeals to people outside of work. And so cracking something
like that and then living it, but also somehow I would say the challenge for all of us in today's world is, let the social media memes not define us. What's that inner strength that
is there in an organization that can in fact resist the social meme? That I think is the key. How many people is Microsoft?</p>
<p>I think around 200,000. Okay, so rough number is, you know, Microsoft is 200,000 people,
Stripe is 10,000 people. Maybe there's someone
who's listening to this who runs a company that's 500
people or something like that. A lot of the things that we do are probably fairly scale independent where you're trying to make sure that you're talking to customers, you're holding a leadership offsite. We're looking at the numbers for '26. We want the revenues to be a bit higher and the cost to be a bit lower. You know, there's a lot
of activities in companies that are kind of the same
regardless of the size. That said, there's also probably things</p>
<p>that only show up at the,
you know, 200,000 person, you know, city state size that, you know, I wouldn't be aware of at the 10,000 person size. What effects only show
up when you're that big? There are two things I would say. Quite honestly, having
only worked at Microsoft, it's not that I'm like an expert. But the one thing I would say,
taking over for a founder, you know, Steve and
Bill built the company, I mean, Paul and Bill started</p>
<p>and Steve and Bill scaled it and I was the sort of
the first, quote unquote, "non-founder person." The thing I realized quickly,
or in fact I got into the job and I realized that I need a team. And just to have the
ability to manage the scope. But then, you know, that A.G. Lafley thing that we put out there, which
I think is a great one. Like what is this, being clear about what does the CEO clearly need
to do though in that, right? Which businesses are you in?</p>
<p>Which businesses are you out
synthesizing the outside, having the standards, setting
the standards for culture, and then the ability to your point about having that performance culture that you can't say, "Hey,
I'm only about the long term, or I'm only about the short term." You've got to deliver both. Getting a real grip of
the four or five things</p>
<p><strong>[75:41]</strong></p>
<p>that only you can do. And then building the
team, building the team. You'd say, "Even at a 500
person, that's what you do." But quite frankly, you can keep in your
working memory, right, growing up as a developer, right? There was a set of things
everybody would talk about. How many lines of code do
you know, right, personally? At some point you sort of
say, "Oh, that's the person who knows that module or that library." That becomes more, like, and everybody starts where
they know every line of code. At some level then you
have to get to the person who knows, "Oh, I know the
person who wrote that."</p>
<p>And I think that that modularity and team building and the cohesiveness is, I
think they most important. So am I understanding you correctly that maybe at the Stripe scale or at a smaller scale, you can still reason about
the product as a product and know everything that you're shipping and
everything like that— But I also think founders
are unique in that sense. because the founders are, you know, that's kind of what is
singular about them, right? Because they've grown
up with it from day one. See, it's kind of hard</p>
<p>to take the working memory of a founder and say, "Oh, let me
take it and imprint it." Sort of a professional CEO. It just doesn't work because the... You know, even for me, I joined the company in '92, I was not there in the
early '80s, right, you know? And so to some degree it
was a continuous scale that only the, quote
unquote, "the founder, CEO" or the founders see it. And so that's why I think having respect</p>
<p>for what founders can do uniquely and founders having respect
for whoever comes next, that they can't be like
we're doing exactly the same thing that they did, right? So that's why I think
this founder mode thing is interesting, which is that
clearly there is, you know, the culture personality of a
founder is unbelievable, right? And you use it, maximize it. Then mere mortal CEOs like us have to sort of also be, you know, you can sort of be in the refounder mode but don't think you are a founder. And that nuance I think
is an important one.</p>
<p>Last question, because we're
running up against time, as we talk about cultures
and building them, what's going on in the water
in Hyderabad where, you know, the school that you went, also Shantanu went there,
Ajay Banga went there. A bunch of good chess players
are similarly from there and southern India more
broadly and things like that. But do you have any theory
on the local outperformance? Yeah, the high school we
went to in fact, yeah.</p>
<p>Until I would say NVIDIA and Jensen, because Jensen has it now
covered for all of us. Yeah, between me and Ajay and Shantanu. In fact the CEO of Procter & Gamble today is also from my high school. See, it's cabal. It's kind of a cabal. I would say one of the fascinating things</p>
<p><strong>[78:41]</strong></p>
<p>growing up in Hyderabad
and going to that school in the middle of nowhere at
that time in the late '70s and the early '80s, I would say, I think it gave us a lot more space. If you look at even each of us, right? Academics was a thing, but quite frankly, we, mostly all of us had things which we excelled at a lot of other things
beyond academics in fact. That was a pretty rare thing
at that time in that country. And so I attribute it
a lot to my high school because I feel that it is a place where it gave us a lot more space and room</p>
<p>to follow what really became your passion. But you were able to take
your time to discover it versus sort of feeling that, "Hey, I had to join some kind of a race." It wasn't as tracked.
That's right. Yeah.
That's right. What was your passion in high school? Cricket. In fact, this, by the
way, the Samuel Beckett. Yeah, so I want to know the story. Sure, you know who... So if you asked the question, who is the one sports person who played actually professionally? I guess he played one or two matches</p>
<p>for I guess the Dublin University and he played first class cricket. And so he's the only person
who played professional cricket and won a Nobel Prize. Really? That's really funny. So you can have it all is the— There you go. The chess, boxing of its
day or something, you know, merging the—
A Nobel Prize winner and he's a professional cricketer. That's awesome. Well, you know, you, you came close but in another life, you know,
that could have been you. Alright.
Thank you so much. Thanks, Satya.
It's such a pleasure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Replacing admin hours with teaching time</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4m7Lm6TlM</link>
      <description>Brightwheel is a leading childcare management software provider and supports the small businesses that make up the $100 billion early education market. The software removes administrative tasks like billing, enrollment, and payroll—giving educators more time with children each day.

<p>Even before families come to our school, before they even step foot in the building, we are interacting with
them on Brightwheel. But then when the kiddos actually
arrive, throughout their kids' day, they can see kind of a ticker
tape of what's going on. It gives them peace of mind. They know that once they've checked their
child in that they're well taken care of. The moment you have kids 
that becomes your life. Like, you have your work, sleep, and your children. We can be very demanding to really develop them to be
kind great human beings and that demands go to the school.</p>
<p>And that's where we as Brightwheel come in. We are the leading childcare
management software providers. We take a lot of the admin and problems
that a school has to deal with away, which allows them to actually
focus on what matters the most and that's the development of
the students in their care. As a director, harnessing this technology, it has freed up literally hours 
upon hours within my week to spend time in the classrooms, getting to know the kids and
supporting teachers. With Brightwheel, you can set up 
whatever billing structure that you want.</p>
<p>Previously, my billing might've taken 
four to five hours in one given day. Now it's just 20 minutes. On the payment side, we're able to provide an amazing
experience there because we partner with Stripe. Receiving those payments on time
are hugely important for our schools. They rely on that to the next day, already use those payments to
pay the rent, to issue payroll. That is like an entire payment
infrastructure that we would have had to build ourselves. Our goal is that parents and schools
never even have to talk about these payments.</p>
<p>It's hugely important, but
they don't have to worry about it. My conversation with families
is 'How was your day?’ ‘Tell me about Grandma coming into town.' I can actually build a relationship because I'm no longer hounding
families for payments. We've grown massively in terms of scale. Today, we are all over the US and Canada, schools from Australia to
Africa to South America, millions of students on our platform. Onboarding is a really key
aspect of our business. We have tools like Stripe
Connect embedded in our platform</p>
<p>and the customer-facing verification
becomes a super seamless process for them. We've made enormous progress, but there's still so many things we could
do in terms of increasing the quality, but also the accessibility of
early education around the world. Handling our subscriptions and payment
and financial aspects of the business through Stripe allows us to use our
cash flows that come in reliably and consistently to actually reinvest
it in R&D and innovation. It allows us to deploy our engineers
to other aspects of our platform,</p>
<p>building more products or making our
existing products even more accessible, and our brand has become synonymous
with high quality and reliable childcare. The extra time that
Brightwheel has given back, really having that time with the kids
to support that learning journey and having that interaction
is literally my job</p>
<p><strong>[03:13]</strong></p>
<p>and the best part of my 
day if I could say so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Julia DeWahl of Antares on building nuclear reactors for the US military</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_i39TTzGQw</link>
      <description>Julia DeWahl is the cofounder of Antares, a company developing nuclear microreactors for the US military and critical infrastructure. She sits down with John to discuss the vision for the "Starlink of electricity", and why AI hyperscalers are driving a nuclear renaissance. They cover the bipartisan shift in nuclear regulation (and why the NRC’s old mandate made "zero" the safest number of reactors), and why true energy resilience requires more than just solar and batteries. Julia also shares lessons from the early days of Opendoor and Starlink, including why customer obsession sometimes means sitting outside a bagel shop.

<p>The US did have this
long-running anti-nuclear bent. I can't even tell you how much has changed in the last few years. They changed the mandate of the NRC and they said you are no
longer focused just on safety. Department of Energy pathways
have been also unopened and unblocked for test reactors. The last 10 years or so, it's been like 1% of
nuclear fuel used in the US was actually domestically mined. We're still buying like
almost 50% of our uranium from Russia and kind of ex-Soviet states. How capital intensive is it going to be to get your product to market?</p>
<p>Oh, in the hundreds of millions. The biggest organization that showed up against Diablo Canyon was
called "Mothers for Peace." This organization was that old that it was related to the
Nuclear Cold War, right? I'm part of this "Mothers
for Nuclear" organization. Mothers against their mothers? Yeah. And then I brought some graphite. Do you want to take that out and I'll show it?
Sure, yeah. This is what we are
using for our moderator in our reactor. It has been designated a critical mineral. It's an important one. But this is just graphite. Like this is not, you know,</p>
<p>uranium-235 or something. No, I wouldn't have brought you that. That would've been a little
bit dangerous to be holding. Julia DeWahl is the co-founder of Antares, which is designing nuclear micro-reactors for the military and
other off-grid use cases. Cheers.
Cheers. Thanks for coming by.
It's great to be here. So you started out first at
Opendoor and then SpaceX. What did you learn in each one of those that you took to Antares? Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I think one of the big things
is always about customers, right? I mean, at the end of the day, this is why you build a business. At Opendoor, a lot of us were pretty young starting the business. I was one of the early employees there and none of us had ever bought, let alone sold a house. So a lot of it was like learning
what that was all about. And I remember in the early days, we just were working on writing
the copy for the website and we're like— You have no idea what a homeowner— "We don't really know much
about this whole thing. So what can we do about that?" We just went and sat outside a bagel shop for a Saturday and a Sunday morning and just bought people bagels and just asked them about their processes</p>
<p>buying and selling a
home and learned a ton. And just really thought about what
language they were using, what were the pain points, and that was really important to just like really get to know what we were trying to
deliver on as a business. And then, you know, fast forward to joining
SpaceX after Opendoor. I joined as Starlink was coming out of R&D and into go-to-market. That's why I was joining.
To lead that team and the business operations there. And we launch and we
get our first customers. And so I invited our first customers to come join us via Zoom for an all-hands.</p>
<p>And it was honestly the first time that many of the engineers
had actually heard from the words of a customer themselves about the experience. And, of course, everyone
loved the internet, right? The fast internet, it was amazing. Rural Idaho, right? This is like a dream. But when we got to talking
about the setup process, everyone kind of was like,
"Oh, that sounds rough." They're talking about
multiple Home Depot trips. They didn't know if they
had to cut down trees on their property. Like they couldn't get a pole long enough.</p>
<p><strong>[03:00]</strong></p>
<p>Ah, so a lot of it was
simplifying people's understanding of what would it mean? Well, people kind of didn't realize how much the setup was so painful. And it led to basically this
cross-functional SWAT team that was dedicated to mounting options to be sold alongside the dish. First-party or third-party? We did it ourselves actually. We said it's important that
we have a good experience for that because actually it is a big part of the experience. And so, spun up a whole team. A lot of attention was given to mounting, which is like, who ever would've thought? And I think, you know, customers again,</p>
<p>they're just like, they are the reason you start a business. And just bringing this back to Antares, I mean, the reason we started Antares was to say like the government,
particularly the military, needs more energy resilience, especially for critical infrastructure. We just do so much more now
in the cloud with satellites. Our missile defense
sites are sitting there like being powered by
diesel generators still. Like, shouldn't we upgrade that? Okay, so I'll buy it. What is Antares? Sure, sure. We're building micro-reactors,
so small nuclear reactors, and we are building, in particular,</p>
<p>for critical infrastructure,
largely for the military. Although we do think
that as costs come down, there will be an interesting
commercial market too. But basically anywhere where
you're off-grid for sure, or you just want
resilience behind the grid as it exists today. Cyber attacks or whatever,
the grid goes down, you want backup power. It's a really great option. Okay. And if one megawatt is
a small neighborhood, if one gigawatt is like
a big nuclear power plant like in The Simpsons, you know? What are your SMRs?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah. There's basically three classes size-wise. You have the really small
ones are the micro-reactors, and we're actually one
of the smallest of those. So we're even sub-one-megawatt, we're kind of in the
hundreds of kilowatt scale. You could think of that as like hundreds of houses
worth of electricity. Then you have the SMRs, which is kind of this
middle-ground bucket, which is an interesting kind
of neither here nor there. But potentially interesting. I'm sure we'll get into, in the hundreds of megawatts or even 50 megawatts. And then you have the gigawatt scale. So a thousand megawatts, and that's what the current
power plants are today. Okay, so you're sub a megawatt.</p>
<p>So we're super small.
I see. Okay. So you're kind of similar nuclear size to what will be on a submarine
or something like that. Smaller than that even. Those are like megawatt scale. So we're like, think about like we're
the size of a car reactor. Think about replacing a diesel generator that's used to power, again, something that would be on the order of 200 to 300 homes of electricity. So it's quite small.
Yes. And so a big part of your
focus is providing power in places where you really
need that reliability. Like you're talking about
replacing diesel generators. Is that kind of the design center for you? Yeah.</p>
<p>Anywhere where you're going
to enable a capability, a mission capability, that wouldn't really
be possible otherwise. So there's actually
some really interesting space applications, potentially underwater
applications as you move to... So you move away from like few, what they call exquisite
to attritable systems. This is where a really small
reactor can come in very handy for, you know, the submarines are obviously
multi-megawatt-powered systems,</p>
<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>
<p>but these could be kilowatts-powered, smaller systems underwater. But yes, anywhere where you're off-grid, where today you're
relying on what they call like the fuel supply chain of like bringing in fuel via helicopter or barge repeatedly. And that being a vulnerability, like this is a great option. So you're the Starlink of electricity. Kind of. We're actually like perfectly paired. And I wish we could
offer a consumer product. That's not on our roadmap right now, but maybe one day, like, backpack-sized nuclear reactor. I presume it can't be on your roadmap, but why not?</p>
<p>Is it that selling to the
government is much easier than selling to something that— There's so many reasons. I think that you always want
to try to get your beachhead where it's the easiest to achieve, right? And so we believe, I believe that premium power is where you
need to go with nuclear. And there's sort of two places for that. One is what we're doing with Antares, which is go to the military, help them with mission-critical need where they're not cost-sensitive, where they already pay more for power. And go there and support them with this next-gen, better
version of resilient power. Or you go and you sell what
we're seeing now, I think,</p>
<p>which is really interesting
with the hyperscalers, is they have carbon commitments. They want clean, firm,
they want 24/7 power. They're actually willing to
pay above market rates for that and they will pay above market rates. So this premium power thing is a really interesting dynamic like where nuclear is
kind of well-positioned. What are the underwater applications? Well, it's really just
think mini submarines. Oh, okay, yeah. Just really small systems like, you know, what drones are to maybe
like larger missiles. That's kind of the equivalent. It's not super far along just yet. Got it. Okay.</p>
<p>What does the path look like between now and producing power for the military? I guess, first in a pilot environment and then at scale outside of a pilot environment. Yeah, well, you know, it's always what are the next
milestones that you can do to prove your technical ability and again, raise more capital to keep
going with your company? I think the biggest risk
often to hardware companies is you don't get far
enough along technically to merit additional investment. So we are thinking a
lot about our milestones</p>
<p>for reactor development. And so next year our criticality test is kind of the first milestone. By end of 2027, we want to have our first demonstration unit demonstrated. And what's really exciting is there's just so much good
policy happening right now from the DOE and elsewhere that is supporting reactor
tests and pilot programs. And so there's just like so much happening where they're opening up federal land. They're removing— starting to remove some of
those like NEPA-type regulations that really just hold everything up.</p>
<p>So there is a clearer path now than there really ever has
been for reactor builds. Oh, we'll get to the regulatory side. I have a lot of questions, but what is your criticality test in 2026? What does that mean? Yeah, it means that you're testing that you can actually start your reaction. So like you've figured out</p>
<p><strong>[09:02]</strong></p>
<p>the right amount of moderator-to-fuel. And you start it going critical. You don't have it continue on for a while. You don't typically have
a power conversion system that's actually taking the raw energy and turning it into electricity. So it's just one of those initial tests, like can you start to put
all your pieces together? And when do you, you know, the fusion guys are all focused on this. Producing more power than you put in. I know that's different. That's a fusion thing, but when do you actually produce power?</p>
<p>Producing power will be like
your first reactor test. It's like, can you do the whole shebang? Like you can get this
thing up and running. It's producing power. And that's what we're aiming
to do by the end of 2027. Oh wow, that's like pretty soon. Yeah. What does the market look
like for these small reactors? Who are you going to compete with? Well, the market for micro-reactors is one of these ones
where it's like, well, there are no micro-reactors
today on the market to just like buy and use. So what do you think
they're going to be, right? And so I think, first and foremost, it's going to be the most critical assets where you just cannot have them go down.</p>
<p>Which is why defense is the
perfect first market for it. And so it's going to be all of
your critical infrastructure on every single base that there is. Obviously, you'll start
with the most critical of critical missile defense
sites and off-grid locations, things like that. And that's kind of defense. Then you think about commercial, basically you have to see where
the cost curves gets you to. Like how cheap can it get? This is just like space, right? It's like those first
expensive launches into space like that better have been
a really important thing you're putting up there, right? But now that launch cost has come down,</p>
<p>you can start to be like, "Oh, what else? What else could we do that
we can do some more stuff that's like maybe not
so mission-critical?" I think we'll see the same thing in the commercial industries. Oil and gas has a lot of areas where they, again, use diesel generators to do things like compressed natural gas along their pipelines and they actually have carbon commitments, which are really interesting that they're sort of thinking about. Ironically, right? Can they move towards some more renewable or nuclear type resources? So I think there's going to be</p>
<p>some commercial applications there too. Mining, for example, too. Like anything that's just like off-grid, hard to power today, really hard to get fuel into. It's perfect market.
Yes. You're probably following the US military, there's all these controversies right now with people talking about fuel quality and fuel contamination issues in Asia, I think it is. But yeah. Presumably places where you're worried about fuel availability at all times and ensuring that you
constantly have access to fuel. That is the place where
there will be the most pull for these solutions. Like that's where generators work worst.</p>
<p>Yes, and you know, there's
a famous defense quote, I think it's "unleash us
from the tether of fuel," which means just like, gosh, the logistics supply
chain has been such a challenge. I mean it was 50% of the— I think the Afghanistan casualties
were from just logistics. And so, you know, having situations where you can kind of reduce that risk helps and it's a great market fit.</p>
<p><strong>[12:02]</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You were saying there's no market for these small reactors today. Why not? Like— We've had nuclear fission technology for a long time. Yeah. Why hasn't it been done? Gosh, there's so many reasons. I think we ended up... I think there was just a
macro really negative climate around nuclear in general. So it impacted anything small as well, coming out of the seventies, and so you had macro forces
related to just like inflation, kind of just cost of capital. People stopped building, which coincided with the
environmental movement, which was extremely anti-nuclear.</p>
<p>They actually sort of conflated
nuclear weapons testing even with—it was just like
"no nukes" with energy. It's like, "Oh that's
actually pretty different." So a lot of things
converged in the seventies and then by the eighties we
stopped building in nuclear. Okay. So you just view it as
a part of the general anti-nuclear swing and thus also led to the cessation of construction of new nuclear plants in the
US and everything like this. Your corner of the market
also got caught up in that. And that's why we haven't
ended up with them. Were there ever products
available at this size range?</p>
<p>There were but they were
pretty few and far between. Mostly test reactors, small things built. We actually put one reactor
into space in the 1960s to test that out. Did it work? Yeah, for a bit. I mean, a few months and was like, let's try to do some systems in space with power. It's important to have power in space and I think that's a whole other frontier. Obviously the US did
have this long-running, anti-nuclear bent where I
grew up in Ireland similarly. Yeah, there was the exact same thing</p>
<p>and Ireland was very paranoid about a particular British
nuclear power plant, Sellafield, that was just across the
channel from Ireland. Does Ireland have nuclear? Ireland has no nuclear power. The UK does. France does. Ireland does not. And I believe it's banned and so you can't, per the current rules. There's actually many states in the US that have bans as well, but they've just been
falling left and right. It's so cool to see. Well I was going to ask this. The vibe has really shifted
over the past 10 to 15 years. Yep.</p>
<p>Why? Honestly, it reminds me of gay marriage. I mean, and if you look at the polling. It came from the youth, right? It definitely comes from youth for sure. But it's like, it just...
Enough things add up and it just swings and no one
ever looks back type of thing. That's how it feels. The percentage point change we've seen in the last five to 10
years is almost 20 points. It's like 17 points or something. So it's 60-plus percent
of people support nuclear. It's actually almost surprising
it's that low in some ways. But yeah, it's just huge
public sentiment shift. And I think the old hippie nuclear testing</p>
<p>or nuclear weapons testing
folks are kind of dying out. What is wild though is I did
a little kind of activism related to Diablo Canyon Power
Plant here in California, which was slated to be
shut down this year. Sure, yeah. And just a few years ago, Newsom had to kind of
begrudgingly say like, "Oh, you know what, we probably should keep this thing on. We can't afford to have
the power going out."</p>
<p><strong>[15:04]</strong></p>
<p>But I listened in on some hearings and actually gave some testimony there. And it was so funny to me that the biggest
organization that showed up against Diablo Canyon was
called "Mothers for Peace." And it's like, do you understand
the irony of your name? This organization was that old that it was related to
like the nuclear Cold War. Right?
Totally. And it's like, gosh, we've moved on. We were joking because I, sort of, am part of this "Mothers for Nuclear" organization that's like tongue in cheek a bit on that. Our mothers against their mothers. Yeah, our mothers against their mothers. And it's just funny how old school a lot of that opposition is.</p>
<p>So I guess as a "science
advances one death at a time" dynamic going on here, whereas
the memory of the 1960s and peak nuclear confrontation and, you know, Three Mile
Island and all these things. As all that fades, maybe it creates an environment where people could be more
supportive of nuclear. Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. What was your activism
around Diablo Canyon? It was just exactly that. It was like, let's make sure
that this actually passes and we don't shut it down. But it's safe. But there was a lot of people
just calling and saying, "Hey listen, nuclear's super
safe, it's carbon-free.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, in California,
we care about these things. Let's support this. Let's overturn whatever
legislation was done 10 years ago that said we
should shut this thing down." And it did pass. So now we do still have it open. Everyone on "Progress
Twitter" likes to complain about the NRC, but for the NRC we would be living in that Jetsons vision of the future and everyone would have their nuclear-powered car
that they used to drive to their nuclear-powered
office and everything. Is that true? How good or bad is the current
regulatory environment?</p>
<p>How much is that changing? Yeah, yeah. I think it's an overestimated
headwind. Certainly today. I think if you go back five years ago, 10 years ago for sure, I mean they hadn't licensed
anything in decades. There had been nothing new. But I can't even tell
you how much has changed in the last few years. It's kind of remarkable. And it's been across both the Biden and the Trump administration, which is amazing to see. The legislation around nuclear passes like 95 to 5 type of thing, right? It's like really, really
strong bipartisan...</p>
<p>What was interesting to see
is it started with Biden, a bunch of legislation
related to modernizing and reforming the NRC. The biggest thing they did
was they changed the mandate of the NRC and they said, "You are no longer
focused just on safety," because what's the safest number of nuclear reactors to license? Zero, so they expanded that, "You must consider the full environment, the full civilization." That's great. And then just change things around like the advanced reactor pathway, removing some of the barriers.</p>
<p>And then it's continued on with Trump and in fact he's sort of added even some more teeth and specificity. So right now, they've changed it to, "You have 18 months to get
your answer from the NRC. License or no license." Like do you pass or not? And what happens if they
exceed the 18-month window? You know, probably it's
in the details somewhere. But the point is that
these have been declared</p>
<p><strong>[18:05]</strong></p>
<p>that timeliness is important. There's also been some leadership change, which is just more
reform-oriented, which is great, and there's just a huge microscope on it. Everyone's watching. Everyone knows who's
submitting their paperwork and what's going to
come out the other side. Another thing that happened
with some of these Trump executive orders is the DOE pathways, Department of Energy pathways, have been also unopened and
unblocked for test reactors. And so actually Antares is part of this new test reactor
program which allows the DOE alongside usually like Idaho National Lab to be sort of your regulator</p>
<p>as you're testing your first reactors so that you don't have to
spend all this time upfront with the NRC for something that you're just still
innovating on and iterating on. And so that's a really nice, I think, first step before you go through the NRC. Wait, so let me make sure
I'm giving this right. There is now a Trump-era change where we essentially
for the first time ever have a second nuclear regulator where you can go the NRC path but also there's a regulatory
sandbox where you can start by working with the DOE and
get up and running there. Yeah, that's essentially right.</p>
<p>How big is the sandbox? I mean, the DOE has always been a path. There actually technically
has always been a path within the military because they license their
own reactors with submarines. So it's always kind of been there but hard to navigate, not
well-staffed, not well-known about. And now it's like everyone's watching. Let's go DOE, let's go INL, Idaho National Lab, and let's
make these things happen. So there's just been a lot of stated like, "You must enable this thing." And like, now here's some... It's actually a $0 program, but it gives you unlimited access to staff</p>
<p>and all these other things. And the point is like everyone's watching to see how fast you can get one of these reactors through safely. So are you guys going
the DOE routes first? Yep, we are. And the DOD route, I mean to say like, the Army is now also able
to license its own reactors, alongside the Navy which already does. So that will absolutely be our first stop. The NRC really only regulates
civilian electricity. So civilian power. So we actually don't need
to even go there yet. I see.</p>
<p>So you could be selling a lot of reactors and never go through the NRC. We'll basically do our
test reactors with the DOE. Alongside the DOD who can now— who has the jurisdiction to regulate. Which is great.
I didn't know that. So this is the rare bipartisan issue. It's a true... Kind of a gem. I can paint three clean energy futures. One is the solar and
regular renewables view. You know, Casey Handmer
was just on this podcast. And solar will get very cheap.</p>
<p>Batteries will get cheap enough such that you can go all
in on solar and batteries. Maybe some other renewables in the mix. But there you go. That's it. Nothing will be able to
cost-compete with that. That's one vision. Another is that we will
rediscover nuclear fission and we'll figure out the spent fuel and everything like that. And we'll just do what we used to do,</p>
<p><strong>[21:07]</strong></p>
<p>which is build nuclear power
plants at larger scale. And that delivers us enough clean energy. A third view is that fusion will work and we'll actually have nuclear fusion at useful, meaningful scale of the grid. Between those scenarios, how would you handicap them? I think it's... You know,
I'm going to leave fusion out because I'm not enough of an expert to know when and how that will happen. I would love for that to happen. How exciting, right? Between the first two, we do a lot of market
manipulation of our energy markets and there's a little bit of like,</p>
<p>flavor of the administration
that does happen, especially between renewables
and oil and gas, right? Nuclear's been a little bit actually immune to that. But there hasn't really
been almost a true market for this stuff. Like the renewables have
been heavily subsidized for a while and nuclear has not been. That did change in 2022 with the IRA. There's now production
tax credits for nuclear, which has a lot of ripple effects. But I think we're going
to see a lot more progress with solar and batteries in particular. There is a reason, however,
that the hyperscalers who are committed to their climate targets</p>
<p>are not just going for,
you know, solar farms. Like why are even thinking about nuclear if solar is so cheap? And it's because actually to get true hundred
percent, 24/7 coverage, the battery or the excess
build-out is massive. It is really expensive. It's basically on par with nuclear costs. So we're not there yet. It's one thing to say. The other is that the cost of solar at the panel level is dirt cheap, right? And installing it dirt cheap, but to actually integrate
it, build the transmission,</p>
<p>and then the added grid complexity where you need now these
peaker gas plants to run when the the clouds come and that kind of thing. That actually has a ton of costs and it's sort of hidden costs. I think it's underappreciated certainly by the solar maxis out there. It's real, you know, and so I think we're always
going to want to have multiple sources of energy, right? It's like diversity is good. It's like if one thing— if natural gas prices are
through the roof, hey, we have these other things. We have this base load nuclear,</p>
<p>which has been just like so stable for us. And I think we're going to
want to have everything. I actually don't think
there's going to be a world that's going to be like a
hundred percent nuclear. But is diversity of energy
sources valuable because the solar maximalist
would say, "No, it's fine. Solar will just take everything." And wouldn't the nuclear maximalist say just we can have a lot of, you know, we figure out how to at scale
produce nuclear power plants and why do you need nat gas? Why do you need anything else? It's a good push if you are able to own, through and through,
your whole supply chain.</p>
<p>You make the panels. You mine and process the minerals, which we have like zero
interest in doing as Americans. All that dirty work is done
in China and elsewhere. If you really did all that yourself, then I could say, okay,
you own it. You can do it. Right now at least you have, "Hey, if your natural gas
pipelines get shut down, actually it's not a problem for us. We're not even an importer anymore. We're actually good."</p>
<p><strong>[24:07]</strong></p>
<p>This is actually the reason that... Do you know what percentage
of France's electricity is from nuclear? It's declining, right? But historically it's been around 70%. Yep.
Yeah. Do you know the US? The US for nuclear? Oh, it's small. It's 5-10%. It's actually more. Really?
18. Oh, okay. And everyone thinks it's below 5-10%. It's like, when I got into this, I thought it was like 2%. But anyway, my point is
that France made a very, very deliberate decision
to actually go to 70%, if not more at the time in the seventies because they had no carbon resources.</p>
<p>So they didn't have the ability to say, "Oh, we'll just dig in our
backyard and we'll be fine." And actually uranium,
while it does require digging out of ground or whatever, is so much easier to store. It's a million times as dense as coal. So it's a lot easier to work with than... The reason people get uptight
about oil and gas supply is that it's like not easy to store. And if it's not easier for you to come by, you better well have good
geopolitical relationships. Yes, yes.
So anyway, this world and where it's headed, I think it's still going to
involve multiple sources. Julia's work involves
managing a lot of risk:</p>
<p>unsolved physics, complex engineering, and a lot of regulatory scrutiny. Managing risk for an internet retailer shouldn't be that complex, but sometimes it can feel like it. Internet fraudsters now
operate on industrial scales. They attack strategically
when you're sleeping and they use AI to
sharpen their attacks now. Stripe's defense against
fraud comes from its scale. When a payment happens on your site, there's a 92% chance we've
seen that exact card before. So it's easier for us to spot misuse. And we recently expanded Radar to block other kinds of fraud, like free trial abuse, promotion
abuse and refund abuse. Stripe now processes trillions
of dollars of payments</p>
<p>each year and every transaction
in the Stripe network makes the next one safer for everyone. So you can focus on your product and not on developing a
world-class counter-fraud division. To let Radar handle the fraud so you can get back to
building your product, go to stripe.com/radar. Tell me about the supply
chain for nuclear fuels. Yeah, I mean, you dig uranium out of the ground and then you need to convert
it to a gaseous state so that you can enrich it and have the... you kind of put in a centrifuge. It goes like this and the
heavier isotopes go out</p>
<p>and the lighter ones stay in and you can pick those out
and make those into your fuel. The mining part has been something that we've hardly kept alive. I mean there was, at one point, a couple of mining
operations going in the US. The last 10 years or so, it's been like 1% of
nuclear fuel used in the US was actually domestically mined. Where are the last
uranium mines in the US? They're places where you would think: Texas, Wyoming, those sorts of places. In the western states. But we now again, like
everything else have said,</p>
<p>"Okay, wake up, let's actually
reshore some of this stuff." So we're starting to
see more uranium mining. Conversion and enrichment is
still largely done overseas. And yeah, we're still buying
like almost 50% of our uranium from Russia and kind of ex-Soviet states.</p>
<p><strong>[27:10]</strong></p>
<p>So I think it is important
that we're thinking about like, how do we have far more of
a domestic supply chain? We have the ability to do it. We have the uranium and actually there's a little bit of Silicon Valley DNA entering the space with General Matter, which is Scott Nolan's
company out of Founders Fund. So he's getting into the enrichment space. They're a uranium enrichment company. They're a uranium enrichment company, which is like real picks
and shovels for a real hard atoms business to do that. But I think it's really meaningful work. I think it's really important.</p>
<p>Do you care more about the mining, the enrichment happening in the US, or just there has to be an independent supply
chain for the whole thing? I think you just want diversity. You know, you don't want
everything from one place. And I think we do want to have capability. So I think all of it should be
at least partially done here and with our allies. How did you end up starting Antares? Gosh, I mean... Like most people do not
happen on this kind of idea. No, you kind of don't
really happen upon it. I was working at SpaceX at the time when I first started
reading about nuclear. And it was when I was actually working on getting Starlinks into Ukraine.</p>
<p>So after Russia invaded Ukraine. And I just started like reading more about the conflict there, probably more than I normally would have, because I was actually
speaking with Ukrainians and like thinking about
what was going on there. I was a history major. So I think there was just
a little bit of like, "Oh, geopolitics.
Resources are important." Russia has a lot of resources. You know, randomly, my cousin
is the CEO of a glass factory, making literally glasses like this. And he is like, "We're going bankrupt
because of energy prices." And you're like, "Golly,
what is going on?" And then I read about Germany</p>
<p>and the nuclear power plants
they were shutting off to turn on coal in a place that is like— It was so insane.
Green Party. Crazy, right?
Lost their minds. So I was like, "What
could be so compelling that someone would do something so counter to their own good," right? As a country, as a nation. And I, at the time, again, I
knew nothing about nuclear. I didn't know the difference
between fission and fusion, honestly, at the time. I certainly didn't know that it was a pretty big part
of our grid and other things. But it just was one of those like completely under-celebrated, under-championed by anyone. The climate tech...</p>
<p>Climate people really
weren't into it either. And so it just kind of
got me curious about it and then just started reading more. Wrote a piece that I posted on Twitter and it's actually how I met
Jordan, who's my co-founder, and he's the one who
actually had the vision for micro-reactors for the military. And I just said, "What a
great beachhead". Like again, premium power, great thesis
to go to market with, and just really got into the topic. How did you arrive at that as a beachhead? I think, you know, you just say like, where can you go that
you don't have to compete on that LCOE level against
the cheap solar panels.</p>
<p>Where do you go where there's a real need? And mission assurance for something critical to the military. Like, they will pay for that. This is also an area where like they were obviously behind
the Manhattan Project. They're here to help
develop new technologies. And so what a great partner to have when trying to do something like this. Has DARPA played with this stuff at all?</p>
<p><strong>[30:11]</strong></p>
<p>Or has it come from... It
sounds like you're working with the main branches of the military. Yeah, you know, we are
not working with DARPA mostly because it's actually
not as technically risky as you might even think. They prefer things
further at the risk curve. Exactly. We actually... In a funny way, it's not even really a tech problem. You know, I mean it's hard
to build these things, but it's not brand new. But someone just needs to know how to— It's not novel in that way. That's interesting. What lessons have you brought from your prior experience
at SpaceX, at Opendoor to building Antares? You know, one of the things I
really took away from SpaceX</p>
<p>was just like really getting into it. It's a very confrontational culture and it's not afraid to say
like, "Screw your next meeting. We need to keep talking about this." And I love that. Like, I want to bring that
energy everywhere I go. It's like, if you are
unsure about something, if you're questioning something, you should probably stop and dig into it. We had this thing called the "Five Whys," I don't know if you ever use— In general, yeah.
It's like a...</p>
<p>one of these Silicon Valley little quips. But it's like that on steroids. And I think the pausing
to probe super deeply, question things, like
really hash things out was a big takeaway I learned. Like, wow, that's really effective at getting to the right answer, at making a decision, at changing course when you need to. And so I've tried to bring
some of that to Antares. You know, investors are
hot and cold on hard tech depending on when you're raising money</p>
<p>and everything like this. Presumably there's a J-curve in investing in Antares where there's definitely some R&D before you eventually start
paying it back with revenues. How is the experience of
raising money for this? It's going to get harder. I think it hasn't been hard to date only because there is interest and excitement around nuclear. It's also just fewer
dollars in the beginning. You're kind of like honeymoon
phase of all of that. I think it will get harder.</p>
<p>I think now the time
is ticking. It's like, "Okay, let's see your next
technical milestones." This criticality test, obviously the full reactor end of 2027. I think it will be challenging. And there are several
reactor companies out there, so it's a bit of a race. I think it's going to be fun. I mean, I wonder what
Polymarket would have to say. Several reactor companies out there, even at the end of the market
that you guys are going after? Yeah, everyone has their
different niche, right? I think our niche is again, the smallest, the most DOD-oriented.</p>
<p>There's a lot of micro-reactor
companies or SMR. And I'm doing this because it's like, "Are they SMR, micro-reactors?" Anyway, that are going after data centers and the data center build-out,
which is an amazing market. I mean, amazing. I think people will pay a lot more, again, going back to the premium power point, they will pay more for power for this. Not exactly our target market. Right, so your niche in the market, it seems like you guys have
selected a part of the market</p>
<p><strong>[33:13]</strong></p>
<p>where maybe there's less competition. There's still some people going after the military applications. There always are. I mean, if you have a good idea, there's going to be a
few people working on it. How capital-intensive is it going to be to get your product to market? In the hundreds of millions. Okay.
Yep. I think what we... And it depends on what you
mean by "to market," right? So I think our big milestones, like can you build a reactor, prove it, turn it on, it's producing power. Then I think you can think
about interesting layers of capital in terms of
pre-orders for your reactor. That's going to be my next question. When does the money arrive?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. Bigger government grants. So we're kind of still in
the hundreds of thousands, single-digit millions of dollars of grants that we are getting right now. But you're moving into
the tens of millions of dollars R&D grants. And then you want to
eventually move into that program-of-record, real dollars. There's a really interesting
program right now that the Army has put out
called the Janus program. Are you familiar with the
COTS program that SpaceX used to bring, to develop their first reactor? Not by name, but I'm familiar with— Commercial Orbital Transport System. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm
familiar with the broad—</p>
<p>So it was the innovation basically to say like, let's try
something that's not cost-plus and let's actually do something
that's milestone-based and you know, "Well,
basically we'll cut you if you don't hit the milestone
and it's fixed contract. We're not going to pay you for whatever." So anyway, the Army has
taken that model a bit and I think used that as
inspiration for this Janus program where they're saying,
"We're going to fund up to three to five companies to
build their first prototype alongside us, kind of at a base. And then we will choose a winner and we want to build 5 to 10 reactors,</p>
<p>if not more on bases." And so the demand signal now is hot. And so this is going to be great
for our future fundraising, for the industry in general. It's like very, very good demand. A lot of incumbents build on military, US defense contracting. What is your experience as someone who's attempting to sell to the military? I mean, people are
actually kind of well aware that this cost-plus model is not great. The question is like, well,
what are the alternatives? Who's going to go do it?</p>
<p>Anduril has been an
amazing example of that. So I think a lot of us in hard
tech really look to them as what we try to emulate. Every branch of the military has these innovative
arms that tell you like, "Hey, we want to hear about your ideas." And they do actually,
you can go talk to them. They're giving out
grants for things like... I do think everyone wants the innovation. They are, you know, and in this day and age
of information everywhere, you can learn a lot quickly. They do want to work with startups. I think we'll only see more of it, but you have things like
the government shutdown</p>
<p>and the pace of government is slow. So you've got to just be able to keep pushing those timelines, again, while not running out of money, to be able to make it through that valley of death. What's been harder than you
expected building Antares? Because presumably you
expected it broadly to be hard. You expected there to be
a lot of technical risk. Capital intensity.
Yeah, harder than expected.</p>
<p><strong>[36:14]</strong></p>
<p>Oh. There's a couple things. I mean, I think, gosh... Recruiting is always hard. You're up against the SpaceXs of the world that have just a lot
more credibility, right? When you're the no-name
person at the very beginning, it can be hard. I think there's a lot of complexity, and even though I said we're making so much
progress in regulation, there's still red tape everywhere. Things cost more than
they probably should. You know, we spend a lot of
money paying the national labs to do things like clear out a pit</p>
<p>so that we can test our reactor. And it's like, we're paying for that. And they're like, "You know, here's hundreds of thousand
dollars. Here's the bill." So there's stuff that you're like, "Gosh, there's really a lot of expense everywhere and it just slows things down." And so I guess we were
somewhat ready for that. But some of this stuff just seems silly and when you're building in software, you just don't have to worry about it. You just sit there,
code, and do your thing and go right to market. When you have to work with
the real world, you have to, you know, you have to play
their games a little bit and you have to follow
the process in some ways.</p>
<p>And there's not always a way around it. Sometimes it's just through. You said there's still a lot of red tape despite the fact that there's been the first Biden-era and then Trump-era improvements. If you were in charge,
I know energies are... Or you know, we'll give you a role with no powers across
all these departments. What would you change? What do you think the
specific improvements we could make are? If I were fully in charge of energy, I would love to see the
US government be a buyer. I think that is... Just like
actually the NASA was a buyer</p>
<p>for SpaceX's eventual launch product. I think having the US
government be a customer for nuclear would be great. And so we have this a
little bit with the DOD. It was a very interesting announcement that just came out a week or two ago that doesn't have a ton of detail, but it's starting in this direction. I think it's very positive. I'm a small government person,
so I don't say this lightly, but I do think there are certain things when it's national security related and things like energy resilience. There should be
public-private partnership.</p>
<p>But anyway, the announcement
is that the US government now wants to spend $80 billion on nuclear development
alongside Westinghouse. So they've basically
chosen the technology. And I think that's actually a good thing because you don't want to... You want to be able to build one thing and then repeatedly build it so that you're not reinventing
the wheel every time. You actually have economies of scale, like the learning curve that
you go down from doing that. So I'm excited about that news. I think that's the type of
policy I'd want to see more of. And, you know, we'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the biggest
ever commercial nuclear public-private partnership we've seen. And sorry, specifically they're
buying from Westinghouse. Just a large amount of nuclear power? Well, it's a combination. So this is where, I mean, the details are a little fuzzy but they've announced 80 billion. They've announced Westinghouse
as the partner of choice.</p>
<p><strong>[39:15]</strong></p>
<p>Not all those dollars are going right to Westinghouse. And that's a company that
makes just the reactor itself. So there's money that you
would spend on a plant or licensing fees or whatever
else that surrounds that. But I think it's really positive. I think what it does is it's a catalyst for the whole industry, right? Like supply chain, workforce. People are now paying attention like, "Oh, there's real
dollars to be made here." There's a huge trillion-dollar
asset under management company called Brookfield
Asset Management. And they've actually just
gotten in the game as well in the last couple weeks.</p>
<p>I'm sure there was talk, right? To take the V.C. Summer plant that never got completed in South Carolina and actually finish it. And so again, they now
have some nice tailwinds with those new production subsidies. They are partnering with
the local utility to... And again, a local utility
doesn't have the risk appetite to do this themselves, right? Or the balance sheet
to do this themselves. And so there's some really nice market signal you get when the government's saying, "We're going to spend
$80 billion on this." But I think</p>
<p>it gets the rest of the industry moving. As you guys were exploring and
developing the early stages of your business plan, did you consider for a product
that is as tightly regulated as this, did you consider
doing any jurisdiction shopping where you develop a product
that you sell in Singapore or the UAE or Prospera or some more favorable jurisdiction? You know, we really didn't. It felt like there was enough signal that we would be able to</p>
<p>get through regulatory and
see some positive change. There was enough basically
demand signal within the US, and it's... I don't know, we take pride in also building
for our country, right? And it feels good to
be developing something for our military and our allies. So we didn't really
shop it around too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I guess the US military is
a large buyer, in this case. Very large buyer. The largest buyer of non-commodity energy, if not all energy. How soon afterwards will you go to, like, I presume you want to do
civilian premium power use cases, like you're saying an oil rig</p>
<p>seems like the one that, ironically that... It
would be hard to get gas, it would be hard to get refined diesel or gasoline to an oil rig. Does that come right afterwards or is that such a different ball of wax from a regulatory point of view that maybe it's like 10 years later? I think it's, you know, you're
developing concurrently. We are talking with oil and gas already. Just understanding them, right? "What do you need? What do you think you'd
pay?" That sort of thing. So I would say it fast follows, right? A few years later.</p>
<p>I think it's going to be
such a nice proving ground if we can make it through
and test on a military base, for example, and get a first reactor live and get some revenue from that, then I think it's like open
the aperture pretty broadly for what else is out there. Does this movement towards
re-onshoring manufacturing</p>
<p><strong>[42:16]</strong></p>
<p>in the US and various blockers
people talk about to that between supply chain
is difficult in your... You've talked about in the fuel context, but also supply chain for manufacturing, talent and the roles that people go into and finding talent in specific areas. I'm just curious. What
has your experience been of building a hard tech company in the US? Supply chain is... Yeah, the bottlenecks. Supply
chain is challenging when you need to work with
nuclear-grade material and no nuclear plants
have really been built. It makes for a very limited
number of suppliers.</p>
<p>Which means costs are higher. You know, options are just fewer. So like, if they're not
responding to your email, well what are you going to do? You know, there's only one other option. And like, I don't know,
they're busy or whatever. So those dynamics are really challenging. The graphite that I
brought here is actually from a Japanese company, right? No one's even processing
that stuff in the US. And so you're kind of, you're literally going all over the world for these supplies. So that's challenging. You know, talent is
challenging in the sense that there are so many options for hard tech in the LA region, right? So you need to have a compelling mission,</p>
<p>but nuclear is compelling. So it's been challenging,
but not in some ways. If you want to work at SpaceX
and you love space stuff and you want to be at
that name brand place, we've lost you. But if you're interested in nuclear and being able to build
from the very beginning, that is a compelling piece. Yes. It's the Shackleton
pitch, you know of— Yeah, totally. High risk of failure.
Totally. And that's the pitch that you're making. Yep.
Yeah, I like that. What trends in nuclear should
we be excited about right now? So the trend I'm excited
about is bringing back online</p>
<p>these recently shuttered plants because they don't take too
much money to bring back online. And we've seen a couple big
power purchase agreements where you have Google
partnered with NextEra or the Iowa-based utility
to bring on Dwayne Arnold, which was shut down about five years ago. And then you have actually
Three Mile Island, the site of the infamous accident is also— Almost accident.
Well, it was an accident but it was not really a big deal. Like this much radiation came out.</p>
<p>It was like this amount of a chest x-ray. Yes, completely overblown "accident". That's being brought back online. Partnership between Microsoft
and Constellation, I believe. So that's kind of fun. I mean, you're seeing like, let's go take these assets
that are just sitting there that shouldn't have been turned off. Bring them back online,
bring them back to life. Tons of power coming out of them. And we need it yesterday, right? Yeah, I mean it's so striking the big trend in the US right now, being that grid demand was
flat for the longest time. Like we were completely not—
Exactly.</p>
<p>Not adding power generation
nor adding power transmission. And now because of data centers, essentially, we have this enormous boom that is just leading to things that maybe previously
would've been competitive. People can't get enough
of anything, right? You know, people can't
get enough of nuclear, they can't get enough of solar,</p>
<p><strong>[45:16]</strong></p>
<p>they can't get enough of natural gas. And just everything is backlogged. It's really interesting. Even the natural gas
turbines are backlogged. Totally, yeah.
I mean, multiple years. Across all the manufacturers. You know, it is hard when something like this goes into one of these inflection points, and to your point, it was less than 1% year-over-year growth for 20-plus years. And now it's like people are estimating 5% annual growth next year. Like, oh my gosh. Last question. What kind of culture do you
want to build at Antares? Hmm. Well, I think it's
certainly one of excellence, and I think that means</p>
<p>delivering quality product. How you get there... I mean, there's a lot
of ways to get there. You can have the combative SpaceX culture. You can have a less combative, maybe more, I don't know, writing culture. They don't write that
much stuff down in SpaceX. To me that matters less. Although I tend to be one
for a working environment that is energized, positive preferably. But I think, ultimately, I would be proud to be delivering on an excellent product that can be delivered
to market soon, right?</p>
<p>And we can all go use. But, okay. So you want the kinda
results-oriented culture. Results speak for themselves
in a lot of ways, yeah. Julia, thank you. Thanks. Thanks for having me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>UK Budget 2025: Stripe + Startup Coalition</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpx24IFszrs</link>
      <description>The Startup Coalition and Stripe host founders, entrepreneurs, and policymakers to discuss implications of the UK Budget for startups and tech companies.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>We are delighted to have uh the minister for AI with us, Kiska Nayan. Uh we are also going to be joined by Alex Dep uh the chancellor's entrepreneurship adviser. So with that, I'm I'm going to hand over to Dom from the startup coalition who's going to be moderating this discussion. Dom over to you. >> Thanks everyone for joining. Um first of all, Keska, what's in the budget? What was in the budget today? >> Thanks Tom. Thanks Tripe. Uh can I firstly just say how great it is to be a stripe. Uh it was a fintech company that</p>
<p>I used to look at a lot when I was a fintech venture investor. I remember when I was at Atomico, we were figuring out uh what to do with the stake that Atomico had in uh in in in Stripe and my strong recommendation was a was a big hold and so I'm delighted to have been validated by the uh progress the company has made and uh and delighted to be here today as well. Look, I can't be more excited uh about the budget as it relates to tech startups and AI. Uh let me let me start with a preview of uh what came before today uh as a uh as a trail in the run-up to the budget which</p>
<p>was an immense package on AI very specifically uh which I think made a big dent and uh it all started I remember about 8 weeks ago now I wrote a note to Liz uh my boss and said um it feels like we're doing quite a lot across government on tech and AI but for some reason the uh the the situation is Britain the in is the inverse of the US where the narrative drags reality up into the future. And in Britain, our reality is actually not that bad, but the narrative kind of drags us down. And we need to shift both the reality and shift narrative upwards. And so we uh</p>
<p>made sure that there was an immense focus on a series of deals. We have a bunch of US unicorns coming here, Cursor, Perplexity, some of the large data center operators, Vantage, all opening up their offices here. But we wanted to make sure that some of the best leaders in this in the world on AI and tech uh were partnering with government in a sign of both confidence and a sign of conviction in what we could do together. Tom Blumfield uh Roya Hatsell, Simon Johnson, uh but also in the form of uh chairing the sovereign unit, James Weiss wanted to make sure that there was a very specific focus on</p>
<p>uh conviction in British firms building here as well. And so we launched a half a billion venture unit that James is going to chair. uh launched a world first advanced market uh commitment for novel chips uh and alongside that uh a very specific focus uh today as well on semiconductors in Wales. And then the final bit was >> not that you're biased about the Wales bit obviously. >> Yeah. Well, I mean I'll come to that in a second. Um I uh the third thing which was really critical was that it felt like Britain could really lead the world</p>
<p>in saying AI is uh going to be critical to the future of the economy but it is going to be critical uh not only by creating slop by by uh pushing the frontiers of science and so we published an AI for science strategy with a bunch of funding associated with it a mission as a country to discover new life-saving drugs and a bunch of associated initiatives on autonomous labs uh data</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>and compute as well as talent. And as a sign of validation, it was nice to see the US launch it 2 days later with effectively a very similar content base uh as well. Uh and so across the board investment deals, a bunch of uh talent uh coming and telling us how we can partner together uh a very specific direction in terms of science was critical. But the thing that was most fundamental which was very close to my heart uh both then and in today's announcements was uh this revived sense of uh the history of uh innovation and innovationist geography in this country.</p>
<p>Uh when I thought uh about the fact that we announced the largest single infrastructure investment in the history of Wales two weeks ago, 10 billion, 5,000 jobs, AI as well as SMRs firing up uh the future of North Wales together. That was a very proud moment for us. Uh about 5 days later, we announced the second largest infrastructure investment deal in the history of Wales in South Wales. Another 10 billion, 5,000 jobs or so. Uh huge compute cluster as well as a bunch of funding for adoption as well. And the reason this is important is not</p>
<p>just because it's really critical for those uh geographies. It's critical because of the wider strategic picture which is that uh we have this amazing history of innovation spread across Britain. And I think we've forgotten it, right? Uh, and so we've forgotten the fact that James Watts in both Glasgow and Birmingham discovered the steam engine and then powered the modern industrial revolution. We've forgotten that Belfast was the linen capital of the world in the 19th century, powered an industrial boom. Uh, Harry Broly in Sheffield discovering stainless steel, a versatile and robust material that</p>
<p>powered manufacturing and medicine. and we've uh forgotten the range of innovations uh that have meant that each part of this country has changed the world before and that each part of the country can change the world again. And so today's budget announcements are really primarily about uh that lens of including as many people as we can in the frontier of technology through expanding stock option share incentives so that more workers can have a stake in the future of this economy by making sure that funding through VCG and EIS is expanded so that people and kids in uh South Wales and the north uh part of uh</p>
<p>Scotland and uh uh England are all able to feel like they have the funding to be able to power the future of innovation. uh but also a deep understanding that yes despite the most difficult of fiscal circumstances uh we want to make sure that there's a clear argument running through the budget on the growth driver and that growth driver is the future of technology and the future of energy enabling technology uh running together as well and that's why in particular the prime minister's announcements on uh endorsing fully John Fingleton's review</p>
<p>on nuclear was a really important part alongside the very major energy package we announced last week for AI proteins as well. So the way I think about it is huge investments, tons of people coming in with great credibility, uh focus on sovereignty, focus on science, but at the heart of it, there's very critical uh argument that the future of growth in this country has to be urgent, has to be spread across this country. Uh and it is now backed by very robust material</p>
<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>
<p>policy changes as well. >> I tell you what, why why do we come to you now, Alex? You've come straight off the off the radio. I appreciate it. Um, how's today been as you take a a celebratory? >> Um, it's been a long looking forward to that all day. Um, today's gone well. I think it's been great because um, look, I'll say the same thing that I've and you're all from this community, right? So, you'll get this like every time you talk to the press, it's likememes, business, corporate, they treat these people, you know, treat everything like this homogeneous blob of business and like that's not it, right? There's</p>
<p>44,000 scaleups in the UK. They're generating over a trillion pounds worth of economic output. They're scaling faster than else. They're creating good jobs. Like this is the part of the economy that we need the public discourse and mainstream narrative to recognize and get behind. Like you need the taxi driver to understand like why we're so important. And so like the Treasury um press office was like, "Oh yeah, I think it's all right. We don't really need you for any media rounds." And then literally the phone's been going off the hook all day being like, "Can we talk about this like EMI thing?"</p>
<p>So that's how I've managed to get myself in trouble because it's it's actual cut through. And I think that's great because it's the first step in what I think will hopefully be I think you've coined this phrase because people keep picking it up. It's like we've got our mojo back. Did you coin that phrase? >> I I I mojo is not me. I always say vibes. >> THAT'S IT. VIBES. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "Is this the beginning of vibes?" And I'm like, I hate that phrase. But yes, >> that's all about the vibes, isn't it? We've shifted the vibe >> as you sit there in your suit. >> I've got to do the politics.</p>
<p>>> I know you got to do the politics. So, yeah, I think I think it's gone better than I'd hoped. But in fairness, like credit to the chancellor, I heard that um when things always get dicey right at the end where you kind of looking at your headroom and things have got to come in and out. There was push to change some of my stuff and she stuck firm and she said, "No, Alex said, and if we're going to do this, let's do it properly." and she did and she stuck to her guns and she pushed my stuff through. So, I think we should all like be really appreciative of the fact that Rachel gets this even if like most of other people don't. Obviously, you do.</p>
<p>>> No, definitely. I mean, I think it's worth saying uh first of all, like I've spent the past however long working with both of these, but Alex in particular in with this package and she's done an absolute hell of a job in in fighting for a bunch of this stuff. Like I think it's fair to say that especially on EMI, which is the biggest thing that in our mind is in the budget, the most important thing, it wouldn't have happened without Alex doing the leg work behind the scenes and giving everyone a chance. >> Are you groveling now? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> He sent the newsletter out and acted like the startup coalition had done it all. And I was I sent him a message and went, "What's the actual fuck?"</p>
<p>>> That was the that's the polite messages that I get from government advisor every day. But what so so just quickly so you know we we kind of Kisha did a little bit of the overview of the package but like what do you see as the most important bits from your perspective what are the things that matter the most >> so for me was I was really clear that I wasn't going to focus on startups because I think we've got like a fairly decent regime</p>
<p><strong>[09:02]</strong></p>
<p>>> and how are you defining startups there that's like super early what's the >> seeds and series A like we've got a healthy VC like network we've got deep talent pools and the incentives CIS and EIS are like relatively okay I give it like an A out of 10 is there stuff to do you're all going to talk to about the ASA long stop and SCIS of course right but in terms of like what's going to move the needle on this economy it is that when you get to like 10 million in revenue or you need a 10 million pound or a 20 million pound check you don't have a lot of options most people get on a plane to the US or they sell too early or worse they you know they like they</p>
<p>enter the valley of death and die and I know because I've been there twice myself so that's where I knew I needed to focus and I needed to focus on two things one access to capital so how do we get more money into the system. And the big myth of the UK right now is that we have a capital problem. We do not have a capital problem. We have a capital allocation problem. Our money is in our houses and it's overseas. That's the problem. And that all started in the mid '9s when we changed the defined benefits pension schemes to defined contribution. And you saw a flight of</p>
<p>capital from UK equities that so you 60% of pensioners money used to be in in UK equities and riskier of funds. It's now 6%. Like when people talk to you about the productivity problem, that's the problem. We don't have that investment going in. And so if we change that and we open up the pathways for pension to flow, we've got more than enough money to do what we need to do. And that's good for pensioners, right? Because VC firms, top quartile VC firms in the UK return 23%. Right? It's exactly the same as the US. We just need more of it. So we have all the building blocks. We just</p>
<p>haven't put the pieces together. So I just have Sorry, I have to do a little plea. So keep talent, EMI, we need it. You guys need I'm sure not all you are founders. Like you want to feel meaningful stake in these companies. You know, the average kind of scale up is 15 years old to 10 years is, you know, we're kneecapping you guys. So get that in. Open up pathways, which is the VCT EIS um stuff. It's getting the BBB to agree to mint 10 new series B funds because then you've got double the amount of funding in there. But like that's not it, right? There's so much more to do. And so what I'd really encourage you to do is read the</p>
<p>prospectus. There's a call for evidence in there because we recognize, I recognize, and Rachel agrees with me, we need to do more. We need to reward the risk takers and I'm not sure we do that very well at the moment. So, the call for evidence is are the incentives that we're using right now working? How can we go further? Is it delivering value for money? How do we incentivize more entrepreneurs to stay and and scale here? Um and then uh the other bits and pieces that are not in that call for review. But the things that I'll be focused on are um making sure we have a</p>
<p>front door to government so that you come through one door and you don't have to talk to DC and talk to HMT and talk to number 10. It's all streamlined to give you the regulatory procurement and and monetary support that you need. And then finally we are actually going to look at at procurement which I think is a huge deal because >> yeah I was going to come back to that >> as you will all tell me give me some revenue right over equity. So we have a</p>
<p><strong>[12:02]</strong></p>
<p>massive spending power in this government and we need to direct some of that firepower at our best companies. So we need to um sort out procurement and I'm not going to say it's going to be easy. In fact, I think it's going to be actually really hard. But why not? >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was going to come I was going to actually I was going to come to Kenishra on two things like one is like you know I think both of you guys are probably amongst the biggest champions for for the ecosystem in government and you know you talked earlier about the kind of vibe shift and how we start to tell a more positive story and that we have the opposite problem of the US sometimes where the policy in the US is crap but the vibes is better like and how do we how do we kind of invert that and how can we</p>
<p>leverage the springboard from some of the stuff today but more generally the the kind of narrative drive and then the second is on procurement specifically it's like you know I think the AI package is the really interesting stuff around advanced market commitments. There's some more stuff on advanced market commitments today around clean concrete which Charlie and my team who does climate tech delighted about um and so like there's some really cool stuff there but like what are the the ways in which you think we can actually unlock some of that using the government money that's already spent? >> Yeah, that's great. So I think the narrative thing is really really important. One of the things that was amazing was uh when we launched this huge 25 billion AI package last week. Um</p>
<p>we had a bunch of people I had a bunch of people from the white house uh the head of the AI labs at Stanford basically tweeted out saying this is um the most advanced level of policym in AI globally. The UK is like killing every other country on it. Uh but there are very few UK founders uh who who do that. Uh and then as I say like 3 days later the US launched a kind of AI for science strategy basically saying what we were saying obviously with a bit more fiscal might behind it given the scale of the US like every founder piled in it was</p>
<p>like Lisa Sue AMD open AI like everyone piled in like this is the greatest thing and it's it's genuinely very good um uh and and we did a very similar thing like 3 days prior and so there's this whole thing where um because we've had this long history uh over the last decade and a half but actually much longer still of not just flack productivity but also very low levels of investment in tech. And exactly to Alex's point, the sense that this part of the economy has not been appreciated as the driver of progress and prosperity for everyone in</p>
<p>this country and not just for people in this room. uh because of that uh I feel like there's a big disconnect between the political relevance of this agenda up till now and at the same time the understanding of politics in this context and uh a huge part of it is to bridge those two things to build trust so that together uh when we do things right u we can tell that story together and we can tell a national story why of why this is a collective mission and when we do things wrong we're able to have those tough conversations as well and so uh that's one big thing and and</p>
<p>the whole point was to try and basically do a big vibe shift. You know, I even like did a website about it. Like the whole point is just like tell gimmicky stories to cut through and say this is a big deal and people care about it and uh you're probably underestimating how much a kid in Barry really cares about it. I had a kid write to me he was 16 years old will. He wrote to me and he said never heard of me. Uh never really been into like my parents aren't in tech or anything but I just learned to code at</p>
<p><strong>[15:03]</strong></p>
<p>home and I just coded a Welsh language STEM learning platform. I saw you were in venture. I'm super excited about VC. this kid is like in Barry in South Wales and he's like I would like to come and pitch to you and I was like hey dude like I'm kind of in politics now but you know let's have a chat and he came and then he he like shadowed you and Blair for a day and now he's like trying to go and uh create a company and so we can just do this because there's immense appetite amongst kids in particular across this country for the excitement that all of us have felt about this part of the world and and I think that's huge on your on your procurement point the the the thing we wanted to do in uh the</p>
<p>AI movement was effectively to say that two forms of public service reform. There's heroic change. You just get awesome people to just take a bite and just like ek out something uh from the system and talk about it. And there's systemic change where we it's much easier to do heroic change, right? It's like you go and do a fiscal event or you do a moment and you kind of do a land grab and you say, "Hey, we've got got this done." That's kind of where we've gotten to on the advanced market. We basically said we're going to go and do 100 million. We're going to design it in a very thoughtful way to basically say as you unlock incremental technical risk, we'll unlock revenue on the</p>
<p>context effectively to align it with stage financing and so you can go and raise a ton of money out of it. Um the next and big step for us both in DEIT and way beyond DEIT would be to uh to actually unlock core procurement budgets rather than just the kind of innovation side lift uh or the AMC kind of part of it which ends up being a small but you know really meaningful part still and that is much harder because exactly as Alex says that's partly about getting the value for money thing right by the treasury. We're in a very fiscally constrained space, right? But but I think it's very possible to do that. And</p>
<p>uh the way to do it, I think in part uh is for us to be able to build a much stronger interplay between what government demands and what people can supply and the front shop window point is really really critical. We're trying to do a big concier service and uh do say it. Uh but you know clearly all of government doing this in a way more effective way and in particular departments like the mod doing this in a very effective way would be the biggest unlock that we can get. Yeah, Alex, I don't know whether you want to kind of talk about you sort of when we've spoken about it in the past, you see procurement as the the big the next big</p>
<p>thing after after the sort of work that you've done on the budget package like but a little bit of reflection on that and any anything else in the package you think's worth sort of highlighting that we haven't covered off so far that you think is really important. >> Um yeah, there probably is my brain's just totally fried. Um, so the BBB have made a commitment to look at IP lending, which um, I think as founders of of businesses that build IP, that's quite good because we're usually asset light. So like venture debt's really expensive, debt is kind of not that available to us. And I I do think there is particularly like capital intensive</p>
<p>projects that would be better off funding through debt than equity. So I think that's a big step forward for us because like the banks have been I mean I remember talking to Barclayers like eight years ago about IP lending and they're like, "Oh yeah, you know, we're going to try and still really got a product at market." So, it's like now now we're going to try. Um, so I think that's big. We're looking at non-competes. Um, try to curve some of the excessive like two-year non-competes because that's not good for our AI or data sector. Um, there are two two</p>
<p><strong>[18:04]</strong></p>
<p>little things that I think are really important as well as the the the um AMC stuff. But I think on the procurement point, um, I just think that like when you look at we've given the British Business Bank 26 million, right? And there's a real debt billion, sorry, 26 billion. Um there's a real danger with the um with that that we could end up crowding out money because we want them to be more commercial, take bigger bets because what what that's that what the bank has typically done is like tried to patch up market failures like to move into space and this some of that still</p>
<p>needs to happen, right? Like that's why we're working on so sovereign AI and it's amazing working with DC like I genuinely DC's got the best people in it that like it makes my job so much easier because I'm we're talking the same language. Same with OFI. Again, another department that I really enjoy working with. One of the ways that we make sure that doesn't happen and there are lots of ways, but like imagine like the power of that like public purse going into a company when we could also say, "All right, we think you are strategically important to this country. You like what you do. Let's say it's you. Here is 10</p>
<p>million and also we're going to put you on our procurement framework so you can access the mod straight away." That is really powerful because most of the reason that our health tech um companies leave and go to the US is not because they can't raise the money. It's because the NHS makes them jump through about a billion different hoops to get onto their like framework and it's just much easier to go over to the US and then the market's like you know 50 times the size or whatever and then you know you get the money on top of it. So we need to start like playing smart like we can't</p>
<p>go toe-to-toe with the Americans nor why should we right there are some people that should raise American money. There are some people that should go and go to America. Like I'm not saying that. Like when American VCs come over here, I celebrate that. But we need credible domestic alternatives if this country is going to grow, which means we need to be able to deploy our own capital and we need to use our own markets more effectively. And that's why we want to do this procurement sprint um for the six months um and run it outside of typical procurement processes. Don't</p>
<p>tell anyone I'm saying this stuff. Um because like think about everything good that's happened in government vaccines didn't go through the normal routes right like everything that we for some reason like in government we just we try to like basically make everything perfect and have no risk and if you read the perspectus what you will say what you will read in that perspectus is if we expect you to take risks then this government's got to take risks we're not going to get everything right companies are going to fail and I think that is what I'm trying to inject into the</p>
<p>treasury a little bit is like this idea of risk takingaking and do you know what they're actually quite game like I mean they're quite scared at the same time but they are quite game for it so I feel really I feel really actually quite positive about 2026 >> good that's very exciting I think one final question before I I'll I'll spin it to the crowd for a couple before Kesh to get his flight where are you flying to you're going you're doing a countrywide >> so I'm doing this tour right I'm going to five cities in 24 hours basically selling what we've achieved on AI and tech in the budget I'm going to</p>
<p><strong>[21:04]</strong></p>
<p>Edinburgh tonight Newcastle Sheffield I think we've ended up skipping Manchester Belfast and then Wales and so >> amazing. Okay. So, so before you have to dispare like my one final question is look like the reality is the stories in the papers tomorrow will probably be like tax rises it's all terrible it's all disaster like there is this real challenge isn't there of like how you balance that sort of the what the line might be that comes out of there and budget day and then the things that you know we see and like we had our newsletter out and like well we didn't give Alex all the credit she very rightly deserves like as in what we did say is actually broadly speaking there's a bunch of measures in there that we</p>
<p>think are pretty good for the community like how do we tell that story effectively how do we acknowledge other wider stuff and understand the challenge but but kind of explain to people actually know from the community side it's it's pretty decent because I've had that today with founders where they've been like it's all the croc of [ __ ] and I've been actually no like look at the package like there's proper stuff in there so like for the people in this room who are having those conversations who might or might have not looked at the detail and be like actually what you talking about how would you kind of frame that I wanted to finish it when I come to students >> well I I think this is really important because um one when when we do things that are good and people recognize that</p>
<p>in the public context that creates political space for people to keep doing a lot more next time round. And so there's a hopefully a bunch of things that you think have have been good things that we've done today and over the course of the last couple of weeks. If you feel that uh please say that in your WhatsApp groups, in your public context if you feel comfortable because one of the things I found very frustrating, I remember on Friday um the times called me and and and I was like, "Hey, we've just landed two of the biggest infrastructure investments in the history of Wales. uh 25 billion of deals uh bunch of top tier people</p>
<p>associating with government James is going to run sovereign AI we've got a world first AMC we've got an AI for science strategy it's just like across the board we've just thrown the kitchen sink at it and all these US guys are saying this is like a global leadership moment why have you not written about it and the guy was like hey I kind of pitched it to the editor and they were more interested in PLP drama uh and so what happens when that happens is when I text uh founders they all text back saying this is awesome uh why is it on the papers uh well part of the way we create this is by creating a demand side of people who care about this stuff when</p>
<p>it goes well talking about it. By the way, there are things that have not gone well, you should also put pressure on us publicly alongside it. But if you do that in a more balanced way uh by recognizing what has gone well and hopefully praising the chancellor and Alex and others for kind of putting their conviction and their political capital behind it, it just creates huge political space for us to be able to go way further on this agenda. And so I think um if I had one ask of everyone in this room, it would be that each of you has a huge role to play uh as outsized uh influencers in this wider ecosystem</p>
<p>to shape a sense of what we believe in together, which is that this is a deeply important part of the economy. Uh it's a part of the economy that is being increasingly recognized by government as important uh in a context of huge fiscal stress. We have put our weight behind tech and AI. Uh there are some things we should go further on. Procurement is a really critical one and you should tell us that publicly as well. Uh because every moment you do that, it means that all of us inside government are able to point to it and say we got praise. We</p>
<p><strong>[24:05]</strong></p>
<p>got political capital from things that went right. This is the next uh mission and mountain that we need to walk up. Spectacular. I can see your PS packing up your stuff cuz I think you got run. So uh thanks very much for that. I really appreciate it. Um for the panel this evening, I've got a really brilliant lineup for you guys. Um I've got Sam Bowman um who is editor of Works in Progress, Matt Pennyard who is um founding partner of ADA Ventures and MVA Ibar who is co-founder and CEO of Hive. Um I want to start by asking you guys all about the vibes. Um there the the</p>
<p>chancellor clearly thinks that she's done you know um enough to sort of shift the dial on this and and Keshka was very buoyant about this. But I mean from what you saw in both the budget package but also the AI package that we saw um last week now um there does seem to be sort of like momentum is on our side. So I mean is this enough to shift the vibe and and are you feeling a lot more positive? Sam, how about I start with you first? >> Uh no. Uh it's like the most miserable budget of my entire life. Uh I I'm like</p>
<p>very it's very nice to see people feel optimistic and happy about this. But um I mean really it was the only I think there was a story in the New Statesman um yesterday that said that the leak that they had done that they were going to raise income tax was apparently planned so that they could then announce on budget day that they weren't going to raise income tax after all and have a good news story for that day. And it does sort of feel like the um the kind of the only good news is the stuff that they said they might do that they aren't</p>
<p>doing like the um exit attacks. And bravo to the startup coalition for doing that. I really really um think that was amazing work. Um but you know for for context you know in 1990 3.7% of taxpayers were higher rate taxpayers. Um in 2020 so only 5 years ago 7 12% of taxpayers were by 2029. So in four years 17% of taxpayers are going to be higher rate taxpayers. So fiscal drift which is just holding the uh bans constant and letting inflation push people into the</p>
<p>higher rate the 40 the 40 but really 42p rate um is is I mean more than doubling in the last in in 10 years the number of people who are facing those really high marginal tax rates. um the number I mean it's really worth bearing in mind the scale of spending increases and tax increases um and and a little bit of borrowing increases. So by the end of the parliament we're going to be spending 96 billion pounds more every year um just based on the last month year and a half of budgets um who knows</p>
<p>what's to come and we'll be taxing 79 billion pounds more. So that's about 2.7% of GDP increase in spending and slightly less than that in tax raising. I mean this is completely catastrophic, right? This was a this was a government that came in saying we're not going to raise taxes on working people which immediately cut off its ability to raise any of the broad-based taxes that you</p>
<p><strong>[27:05]</strong></p>
<p>know they're not nice to pay but they are relatively less harmful economically and so has backed itself into a corner because it has so many spending commitments that it's made um that it means it has to raise other taxes that are much more economically damaging by much more. And it would be one thing if they were forced by circumstances into this but they're not. I mean, some of the tax increases or some of the spending increases are completely bizarre. You know, the the railway uh ticket freeze, they were advertising that this um will cut £315 a year from the um railway fair paid by somebody who</p>
<p>commutes from Milton Kees to London. Like, why is that a priority? I don't understand. I literally don't understand. The the vast majority of people who use railways are people who are relatively well off and live in the southeast. If you are going to spend money on infrastructure, for example, or transit, then people who take the the train to work every day are not the people you want to help. The thing that really matters, I mean, all of the stuff ultimately was a bit of a damn squ budget. It was there was nothing completely terrible. There were a couple of good things that, you know, I I'm</p>
<p>happy to go into the like three semi good things uh at some point so that I'm not a total downer. But I mean all of this is the shuffling deck chairs because as long as economic growth is stagnant um this is I mean this is the world of degrowth like we we have lived in a degrowth country for 15 years. Um the most important announcement by far was the non-announcement on the nuclear regulatory task force. Um energy is one of the really one of the three really big supply side things that the UK is a really really really bad position on. and the nuclear regulatory task force came out with an excellent report um</p>
<p>earlier this week that proposed um I think it was 47 recommendations which really would be transformative and I had been very very optimistic and very hopeful that the government would say that it would be adopting this report and implementing it. Instead they ended up doing kind of the mother of all fudges where the written speech said you know we accept the principle of all of the proposals here and we we plan to implement them. The chancellor herself didn't even say that. she just stood up and said, "Oh, I really like the report. It's great. Anyway, thanks very much. We'll move on." And I think that the takeaway for me is, and the thing that</p>
<p>makes me depressed, and I should say I'm ultimately a very optimistic guy. I'm just kind of short-term short-term pessimistic. I'm short-term pessimistic, long-term optimistic about the UK. And um, you know, the the reason to be pessimistic isn't that they've raised this tax or that they've increased this spending. You know, reasonable people can disagree about that. it's that they seem totally incapable of doing any supply side regulatory reform. Like they seem completely incapable, they seem paralyzed and unable to do any of the changes that would be needed to drive economic growth. And if that's true,</p>
<p>then we're just going to see more and more budgets like this and we're going to feel like we're circling the drain until something changes. I think um I think the nuclear point is really well made and I think actually what we heard from Keska this evening is a little bit you know bit more positive than what we heard from the chancellor at the dispatch box which was you know fully endorsed so again we're talking sort of specifics on language but we will see we will see on that point Matt um take us</p>
<p><strong>[30:06]</strong></p>
<p>up a notch please for the love of >> yeah I think these things can get pretty boring that was very impressive by the way amazing analysis but I'd call [ __ ] on the vibes is what you asked about and I think you can use uh data to prove a narrative. I think a lot of this is about narrative. We live in a country that tends to have a negative bias when it comes to nar narrative. We love to [ __ ] and moan about things. The media just perpetuates a lot of that. But actually, as I sit here as a taxpayer and a VC, I genuinely my vibes is what you asked about are really positive. I</p>
<p>think this is a launchpad. It was a bit of a this way that way budget, but I think that it could be a launchpad and vibes for me come from do I see really bloody smart people that I respect having the era of government and the answer to that is yes. Yeah, I think we've heard from two of them here today earlier. I think when I see the things that Matt Clifford talks about, if you haven't seen the um LFG speech, say let's [ __ ] go or let's get growth or what whatever that >> looking for growth.</p>
<p>>> Looking for growth, whatever that really stands for, >> you know that and Matt is one of the smartest people I know and and he is talking a narrative that gives me longer term confidence. And so I think that narrative is extremely important. You know, I just also would like to take a quick vibe check in the room. Can you put your hand up if you're a founder? So, it's like 60% founders. Do you feel And then everybody put your hand up if you feel on balance positive about the budget today. Okay. So, it's getting there, right? So,</p>
<p>people have got to be convinced. But I would say the vibes are as a taxpayer, who's got the year of government, who is influencing government? And I felt really encouraged when the exit tax was being booted around and pretty quickly somebody listened and that got taken off the table. Now I don't know the machinations behind that but I felt pretty good to live in a country where that's possible. So positive vibes. >> Perfect. And Murva you're on the ground out of the cold face so to speak. So you know how how are you feeling? I think um I'm in um the look position where I have lots of founders around me and speak to</p>
<p>them constantly and I think more than ever since my journey have started in 2021 to now I've seen the past year or so a real sort of togetherness with founders of like actually let's let's build Europe great again let's let's build the UK let's take it on and I've um when the exit tax was floated I thought everyone came together really quickly like you said I think there's more um communication with government than ever before in the first few years compared to now. Um I think that they're getting in the right place. I think it's going to be slow for sure. I think we just need to take more risk um</p>
<p>generally. I think in I think the the growth will come from entrepreneurs taking risk and building great companies and then hopefully listing here as well. And I think anything we can do to continue that is just going to benefit the UK. So my whole thing is just about you know culturally because I spend a lot of time in the US because obviously the US is the biggest place for startups and I always think about how what what are they doing right and what can the UK</p>
<p><strong>[33:07]</strong></p>
<p>do better and it's just that culture it's the appetite of taking risk um later stage founders who have IPOed who are successful then reinvesting into early stage founders and building that ecosystem up and so if we lose a lot of companies to not listing here or exiting that's going to be detrimental because you need those entrepreneurs to reinvest to build up the ecosystem. So, generally quite positive, but that's maybe I'm a bit in a small echo chamber of just speaking to founders constantly who are just building great businesses. Um, but I think there's a there's a huge sense of let's make sure we build great</p>
<p>business in the UK and how can we actually work with the government um to actually make change and they are listening. I've had lots of conversations this past year with lots of men who are trying maybe not quick enough uh to what we want as especially as startup founders who are running at the pace of 100 miles per hour and executing really quickly. It can be sometimes quite frustrating when you see how long it takes to actually deliver the budget and then get it out etc. Um but generally I'm I'm always optimistic. I think one of the things that I was pretty shocked by today is essentially you know the the chancellor stood at the</p>
<p>dispatch box and rattled through the usual sort of suspects cost of living um you know NHS waiting times and then and went straight to our community next she said you know growth doesn't appear out of thin air it's built by founders who bet on an idea it's firms breaking into new markets and developing new technologies and I think we heard from Alex tonight like there is a real sort of shift in focus to that sort of scale up capital and so MV and Matt, maybe I can come to you on on that. Um, particularly, I guess, MVver, from your perspective, you raised like a very</p>
<p>impressive 42 million series B earlier this year. You're growing, you're in eight new cities this year. You're adding to your headcount, so hopefully EMI is going to help you like the sort of like new um thresholds there. But where, you know, do you do you feel sort of confident that you can continue to build here in the UK and grow here? Um and then Matt to you sort of like same question particularly when you look down to your portfolio. >> I think good question. I think there's no doubt that there is definitely a scale of capital gap here for sure compared to the US there's a lot more</p>
<p>deeper pockets. Um I I definitely am more confident. I think the British British bank announced a lot more funding for Lee. I think we need to continue doing that. But for one thing that I do know is we in this in our current round we got an investor in the US not who led it who joined it. Their answer was two weeks and the money was wired. In the UK, it's like three, four months of deep due diligence and it's just complete different mindset. And so that's the problem we're also facing. It's sort of like just the execution and the pace, but also just the amount of capital. I think the UK is probably the</p>
<p>third third largest market in the world for, you know, ventureback startups, but the the capital in the US is just it just dwarfs the UK. So I I think there needs to be a lot more in that scale up. And I think there's a lot of great things in the early stage like you have the EIS relief etc. But that goes to a lot of early stages and companies that we're not sure if we're going to make we really need to invest a lot more capital a lot deeper pockets into the scaleup companies because they're the companies</p>
<p><strong>[36:07]</strong></p>
<p>that are really building you know jobs bringing it hopefully back into the environment. So it is a lot trickier to raise you know larger rounds in the UK definitely compared to the US and I have firsthand experience of working with the US how much quicker it is than compared to the the UK unfortunately. And Matt, do you want to touch on that sort of like point as well on sort of like speed and um speed of execution as well? >> Um yeah, look, scaleup capital is a global business and so the big providers of scaleup capital tend to be global and so their perspective on what they're going to invest in is international. So that is a difference from when you're</p>
<p>raising locally up to maybe series A. We take our companies over to San Francisco a couple times a year and we slowly introduce them to the ecosystem over there, both operators and funders for this very reason. So this is a problem. this remains a problem but it's because something doesn't get fixed overnight. Can't fix that in in a budget announcement. Um we are doing things in the right direction. The BBB is now starting to invest directly into some of those companies. They particularly identified series B deep tech companies as a funding issue. That's their mandate. Step into capital market points of failure. So I think that's something</p>
<p>that will just take time to change. But a big driver of that also is the the talent that comes out of these later stage companies. the founders with that have made you know financial and and human capital and they're starting to share that and you were all feeling the ecosystem which you operate change I suspect I know I am and so I think that will change but that's taking longer >> and I think I mean I was at a dinner yesterday evening and they were saying like the reason why in Silicon Valley there are so many more sort of people who are like wanting to found companies is that they they've seen the benefit directly like they've seen their friends</p>
<p>become multi-millionaires etc off the back of that and so Sam I mean I'd love your sort of broader perspective on you know the the chancellor also touched on the fact that you know when talking about risk as a country as a population like we're not very good at sort of you know retail investment etc. we still sort of put our money in houses and in cash is etc. So are we seeing a shift in the dial there and and how can we accelerate that so that actually you know everyone feels money in their pocket and sort of like the upside of the amazing companies that are being</p>
<p>built here today. A lot of the discussion around this focuses on the kind of demand side for investment. You know, it focuses on not enough people are putting money in. I think it's much more important to look at the supply side. Um I think that when you look at for example the performance of listed companies, so the Footsie 250, which is primarily like actually UK operating companies has performed kind of catastrophically bad over the kind of past 15 years compared to the S&P 500. Like even if you take out the Mag 7 um which is like really really really crippling um the the analysis it's still</p>
<p>much much better to have invested in the >> SP it just a bit doesn't it >> it skews it quite a lot but I mean that but but the >> the performance of listed companies in the UK has been really really really dreadful and I think that when I hear a lot of groups um especially groups actually located around here arguing that you know we should be directing more investment from pensions or from</p>
<p><strong>[39:09]</strong></p>
<p>ISIS or whatever into UK um assets. I get quite concerned because I think that it might get the >> my question is slightly different because we can I think we can debate sort of like the specifics there but there is just generally you know people are just more likely to put money into property more likely to sort of sit on cash how do we you know we've talked about sort of like the founding founders mindset in terms of taking risk but how do we as a sort of population also take risk >> well so so this is the this is the point that I'm making that I think it's much more important to make sure the investment opportunities are there and</p>
<p>attractive and will deliver good returns I think people will will put their money in if those if those opportunities are there. Like I don't think it's about pushing people either via behavioral interventions or via um more kind of like laws um into investing their money. I I just I think that the idea that um culture is upstream of this stuff I think is probably not in fact the the way it works. I think it's much more likely to be the case that when the money is there, maybe initially the money will come from international funds and and you know there is a lot of money</p>
<p>internationally around but I think it's much much much more likely that people are going to become risk-taking and going to be willing to take money out of cash savings and put it into more um kind of high-risk investments if those high-risisk investments are going to going to deliver them a good return. And so far historically in since 2010 that has not been the case in the UK. So that means that we should be focusing much more on how do we make sure there are lots and lots of opportunities. How do we reduce costs? Make sure there's a lot of access to talent. Make sure that it's very very easy to set up a business and that the input costs, things like</p>
<p>energy, things like labor, things like property are cheap enough because they're plentiful enough that you can have loads of bets and that you can have businesses that when they do have a good bet can scale up and can make a lot of money. Then in that case, I don't think there'll be a shortage of people willing to put their money in. It might come internationally at first, but if it's there and if it's delivering a good return, I don't think we're going to need to convince people to take the money out of a cash ISA and put it into a stocks and shares is. I think they'll do it because the money will be there. >> I hope so. MVA, I'm going to stick with this sort of theme of like risk because</p>
<p>it seems to be the theme of the the um the budget and and even in the Fingleton Review, he talked very much about how we sort of are very willing to punish risks but not reward success. And you know when you think about how you were starting when you were starting out that's a huge risk you took a bet right like is there anything that you saw in the budget today or that you would have you would love to see in sort of like the prospectus that Alex talked about that would help encourage sort of like the next generation of entrepreneurs to sort of take that risk and make that bet. I don't know if there's anything budget for I know I think it's in</p>
<p>Finland maybe I can't remember where I'm not sure if this is but there's something of like if the startup founders fail there's like an unemployment sort of yeah Denmark right there's like an unemployment something and I remember that was a the main thing that on my mind luckily I was just too risky to kind of do it my you know I started the company when I was 24 I didn't really have any money my parents were like what are you doing I got a job in consulting they were like take it I</p>
<p><strong>[42:10]</strong></p>
<p>was like no I want to start my company and they were like right we're not going to give you any money just to, you know, just figure it out yourself. And the only risk, the only thing I thought about in my head was just like, what if every everybody I spoke to, friends, family, everyone was like, but what if you fail? And I was like, well, I'll just figure out I'll just get a job, right? But I don't I was lucky enough to kind of have that confidence, but I know a lot of people don't, and I think something like that would be quite cool. Uh, but I don't know if that, you know, is possible. Um, and just I I think just as a culture, as a society, just embrace</p>
<p>failing a little bit more. Like the press is so negative. Everything's so negative. Just in the US, you get praise. If you're a second or third time failed founder, another investor will bet on you again because, okay, you've done it two, three times. Here, it's just doom and gloom. If you fail, the press are all over you, you know, and I think that's just culturally not a right thing to do. And we have to we have to strip that away and stop being so negative about failure. >> I think that's really true. And I think you know the sort of like the the you fail and you get back up again and that sort of shows that sort of like strength and resilience is like absolutely key.</p>
<p>Matt, in terms of sort of this call for evidence and how you sort of incentivize entrepreneurs to get going, what's something that you would love to see? >> Um I think a lot most things do come down to incentive. You know some Charlie Munger or somebody said that famous thing, right? And um I think that anything anything more you can do to layer on to encourage people to take that risk that you took cuz you had that inbuilt confidence that allowed you to to do it even when everyone tells you not to. Some people need a nudge. I actually think this is an unbelievable country to build a startup in. It's got</p>
<p>the rule of law. It's got some things that we sort of are less talked about and less celebrated that you don't get around the world. Um so I I think we're actually pretty well set up here. The the startup kind of production engine here is operating at full steam. Um, I don't think that's part of the part of the issue. I think with EIS and those kind of things, that's wonderful. That really crowds in capital. Um, I think the issue is more further downstream and I think it's things like we don't want to sell another deep mine for 400 million quid. You know, I think those are the issues really. Where is that scale up capital? Where's that ecosystem? By the way, I think it's</p>
<p>coming. You know, we can focus on the negatives about stock market performance and things like that. They're trying to change. I don't think we would sit in a room like this 10 years ago and have the energy, the vitality. I mean, I couldn't believe that Alex and we've probably all seen her do that show a few times before. This woman is a wrecking ball in snakeskin boots, right? I mean, like, you wouldn't see that level of access of somebody with that point of view and that perseverance being given. They'd be shut the door be closed on them, right? So, I think we are living in a in a world that is more building the future that we're talking about. I actually</p>
<p>don't think it's so much about incentives to get people to start businesses here. I'd love incentives when they become successful. I love people the government to say actually if you're successful you know don't reduce entrepreneurs tax relief right that's just it doesn't send the right message it doesn't the narrative then people can pick up on that and start you know politicizing it and mediaizing it so I think you can do things that do say to people yeah build a company get rich you know that was Matt Clifford's big message right we got to be rich if we want to do all these cool things in this</p>
<p><strong>[45:10]</strong></p>
<p>country so yeah you can definitely tweak the incentive structure to encourage that >> yeah and credit like you know where credit's due like they not only got Alex in but have invited her to stay after sort of seeing that show a few times, right? And and had Matt Clifford and Poppy and now Jason. Um you've got sort of like Jane's wives like these are sort of big names and giants in our industry that are like going in and like doing their sort of tour of duty and sort of credit to them but also credit to the government for sort of bringing them in. Thank you so much for coming. Huge thanks to my panel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A conversation with Vercel's Guillermo Rauch</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faaRYgijQ-w</link>
      <description>Guillermo Rauch, CEO and founder of Vercel, joins Stripe's Head of Data &amp; AI, Emily Glassberg Sands, for a fireside chat on how Vercel scaled to $200 million ARR by shipping week-over-week, why AI agents are becoming the next users of software, and how natural language is transforming into the new programming primitive for builders.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:14]</strong></p>
<p>Well, thanks so much for being
here today for Build Day. Build Day's really all
about turning great ideas into great products, and so when we stepped back
and asked what that might mean, we thought, well, no better
company to talk to than Vercel, who's very much at the forefront
of making that possible, and Guillermo, in particular, who, of course, is the
genius behind Next.js and Vercel in parallel. So, lots of good conversation
to be had around open source- Good to be here, thank you.
-And business. I think earlier this year</p>
<p>you guys announced 200 million ARR and a doubling of users year over year. For those of you who are
reasoning about sort of scale and what might be possible, I heard 4.3 million downloads a week of your AI SDK alone. Yeah, it's hard to keep count of downloads 'cause they're growing so fast. Good problem to have. But, yeah, the business has
been growing really fast, and, as many others I think here, it was born in the cloud
and it was born on Stripe. Amazing, and, you know, I think with many of today's startups,</p>
<p>rather than reasoning about
year-over-year growth, we're increasingly reasoning
about month-over-month growth or even week-over-week growth-
Day. Day.
Day? You could ship something today that makes a huge difference. Always elevating ambitions, amazing. Well, thank you for being here. I thought we could start maybe
a bit with your background. Born in Buenos Aires,
taught yourself how to code? True story? That's right, yeah. Curious about kind of your early journey and what brought you to the US. You know, there are a lot of parallels between what I set out to do
with Vercel in my early days because teaching myself to code</p>
<p>and speak English was
quite the challenge, but- You taught yourself English? English was not spoken at home? The funny story, no. In fact, my parents were
really interested in it 'cause, in Argentina, like,
the country was always divided between like capitalism and socialism. And my parents were very much
like engineers themselves, industrial and chemical engineers, and they had a lot of admiration
for great engineering. And they knew that the
cutting edge would be in Silicon Valley in the United States,</p>
<p>but you needed to know
English in order to get there. And so I was interested
in software engineering, and I noticed that a lot
of the programming manuals, documentation, readmes, were in English. So I basically had a
bootstrapping process to do. And I tell people these
days that, you know, AI is sort of a before and after because, if I go back in time and I'm trying to teach
myself how to code, I can do it in my native language, and I can do it at every step. I can just ask the LLM to teach me. Like, literally, one of the
things with LLMs is like, "Explain quantum mechanics like I'm five."</p>
<p>I could have done that. I could have-
When you were five. You could have done that
when you were five, yeah. So I didn't have that. The next best thing was the internet, and the next, next best
thing was open source. So, for me, one of the discontinuities in my learning journey
was when I started getting to know the open-source communities, contributing to open source, spending a lot of time connected with strangers on the
internet, as one does,</p>
<p><strong>[03:15]</strong></p>
<p>and learning together. And so I started contributing
to a lot of web frameworks. One of the earliest was called MooTools. It was a JavaScript library, and that was actually very formative. You know, if I think of my resume, my resume was a bunch of
the open-source projects that I contributed to. And the web itself was
for me sort of the vehicle that allowed me to
basically leave Argentina and become a worldwide
figure in programming because the instant that
I was able to use the web to very quickly ship things,</p>
<p>fork something and put it out into URL, now you have a worldwide audience, right? These hyperlinks can travel at the speed of, you know, thought pretty much. So fast-forward to Vercel
and had the same inspiration. If you wanna start a company, if you wanna start a digital business, if you wanna ship your next big idea, I need to make it extremely easy. I need to remove all of the friction. And, funny enough when I
was here in Silicon Valley, I had already sold my first
business to WordPress, I noticed that, you know,
the cloud was all the rage.</p>
<p>I always encourage people to think about platform shifts very closely. Clearly now we have a
platform shift towards AI. Like 10 years ago when I started Vercel, the platform shift was towards the cloud. I looked at the cloud, and it was so hard, even though I had like 10 years of engineering experience under my belt. And so Vercel set out
to remove all friction, from idea to global cloud application. And so you're kind of
developing Next.js and Vercel, one open source, one is
a business, in parallel.</p>
<p>I'm curious like hard
trade-offs along the way when you had to make a
call, one versus the other. Yeah, where there was no
trade-offs was in my vision. I wanna make the web easy, and so when I was thinking
about it from first principles, something that you guys
love to do here at Stripe, okay, I sat down, and I needed
two halves of this equation. I needed the tooling, compilers, programming language, runtime framework, and then I needed the
cloud infrastructure. And so interestingly enough,</p>
<p>I noticed an asymmetry in the market. I noticed an unmet need because most of the platform providers were leaving the framework
side for you to figure out. So AWS and Google Cloud and whatever, like, here's a bunch of
like virtual machines and clusters and networking solutions. Right, you do the rest. It's like the meme of
draw the rest of the owl. They were like, "Here's some primitives. You figure it out how to
build an application." And so I looked at it
from first principles. I was like, "Wow, that's strange," 'cause as I'm in the act of
drawing this proverbial owl,</p>
<p>I'm realizing I need tooling. And so that's where the
idea of Next.js came from. It's like, hey, I wanna
create an application that is of the
sophistication, performance, and flexibility of the
giants of the internet 'cause I always caveat my
little storytelling with, look, there were ways to publish to the internet really easily.</p>
<p><strong>[06:17]</strong></p>
<p>You could have, you
know, go to Squarespace or Wix or Tumblr. Like, there were ways
to get something online, but my aspiration was
that you would be born- much like Stripe-like, your
business is born on Vercel. It never graduates because we give you infinite
scale and infinite power. And so I solved the Next.js
side, made it open source, and then I also needed to
solve the other equation with half of the equation, which is, all right, how do you host and scale this? And I also set a really
high bar for myself. I wanted to make it
universally performant.</p>
<p>I wanted to make it such that
without even being an expert in optimization or infrastructure, you could deploy something that scales and performs excellently. And so those were the two things. One is more on the business side, and the other one is sort of
our presentation to the world. Our cover letter to the
world is start with Next.js or any other open-source
frameworks that we contribute to. I mean, awesome that they
were so hyper-complementary, right, additive. Were there hard trade-offs you made? I mean, even in your own time-
Yes. Like where you spent
your own time and energy?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's funny because
I had to overcome a few bad, I guess, intuitions
in order to get there. One intuition that I
had at the beginning is: in order to create the world's best and most successful startup, I
have to make everybody happy, like every single person. I feel like that's just a life lesson. In order to be the best, yeah, you don't have
to make everyone happy. You have to be somewhat disagreeable. Yeah, so who did you
agree to disagree with? So, interesting, and this is why like the
story like seems so simple now</p>
<p>that I tell it, it's like,
"Oh, wow, like, genius. Of course, you created the framework and the infrastructure." In the beginning, the
infrastructure was so generic that I was trying to appeal to everybody. You liked Java. It's like, "Oh, I can't let Emily down. I'll do some Java over here. Oh, and you like Next? Oh, okay, I'll do some Next. Oh, and you..." And so I really was just beginning to straddle myself like really thin. And so the principle that
I've now extracted from this that I'm very happy to
share with the world, because it can save you some pain, is your ambition for a
venture-backed business that'll reach global scale
should be pretty much unbounded.</p>
<p>Like, we're here today. We're gonna colonize Mars
someday, sometime in the future. So that's the like long-term
aspiration and ambition. But you also have to meet it with realism because, if you're just
pure unmitigated ambition, you're gonna be so up in the clouds- not the actual cloud, but
the, like, metaphorical cloud- that you're not gonna get anything done. You might get into a situation
being jack of all trades, master of none-extremely
dangerous situation to be in. You might get into the situation
of what some call it like,</p>
<p>you know, having a
million mediocre customers versus 1,000 customers
that really love you. And so what was obvious in retrospect, and we did end up doing is, "Hey, we'll start by dominating a niche." So the niche was- which is funny because
I think a lot of things that we believe are
niches turn out not to be-</p>
<p><strong>[09:20]</strong></p>
<p>'cause we've had $250 million of revenue from a niche, which is front end. First chapter of Vercel was front end, hosting the front-end side of
websites and web applications, and then CDN and security services. Our next step, which has come way later than I would've expected,
is back-end: agents and the AI cloud, and all those things. In many ways, you have
to earn the privilege to expand that product lineup or that customer base in order to get to the ultimate
ambition of your business.</p>
<p>Actually, we're seeing that
in a lot of the companies that are being built now. What feels like a niche with
like a global user base- and especially sort of like
ability to reach markets that are well beyond our
own-are not niches at all. They're like very, very large markets. Okay, but you had to make
hard trade-offs at the start. 100%.
Had to shoot for the stars and then decide like which
planet you were gonna land on first.
100%. You talked about like, you
know, the new frontier is AI, and we've talked a bunch about open source versus closed source. I'm curious in the context of AI how you think about open-source models</p>
<p>versus proprietary models, both in terms of like what
the industry is building, but also in terms of like how developers should adopt the two. One of the things that I believe is that once your business
reaches product market fit, you can't get too satisfied, right? Because the world will
expect you to do more. Your customers will want you to do more. You'll have the people
and funding to do more. So you can, you know, expand
into other adjacencies. And one of the rules for when do I expand into my next chapter- there's a bunch of rules
that I have or principles.</p>
<p>One is what I call brand permission, meaning if Vercel
tomorrow launched a washer and dryer product, even if it's slick and
black and beautiful, you'd be like, "That's a little strange. I was expecting them to launch maybe like an AI coding tool." Like your brand doesn't
yet give you permission to launch a washer-dryer. And also you want to
expand into adjacencies to your core competence. So, if you do payments, you
can handle billing next. Or, if you do payments,
you can handle fraud next</p>
<p>and things like that. And so, for us, with our new chapter of becoming the AI cloud, what we realized is that
there is a lot of demand for the same things
that we did in the past. People want simple frameworks, tools, and solutions for creating agents. There's like a new
protagonist in this story. I call it, first chapter of the internet was about pages or pixels. In fact, if you've used Next.js, you know that the very
first thing we asked you to do was create a pages directory</p>
<p>and toss your files in there. It's like very much PHP-inspired. The next chapter-
Pages and pixels replaced by? Agents. And so agents might not even
have a face, so to speak, intelligence that is sort of
permeating everything you do, meeting you in every conversation, in every platform integrated into Slack,</p>
<p><strong>[12:20]</strong></p>
<p>integrated into Zoom,
integrated into, you know, parsing your documents while
you're doing other work. And so this is a completely
different paradigm of the type of software that
we've all been building. And this is why it's exciting
to start a business today because that feels to me
like a platform shift, and what's interesting
about platform shifts is that the old thing doesn't disappear. So it's not that tomorrow
there'll be no pixels or we'll get to a point
where there is no pixels. Much like today, we still
have AM and FM radio, so the older technology is still there,</p>
<p>and it'll have- I think in the case of the web, pages and URLs and
links are gonna continue to have a ton of relevance. But clearly there's a new type of software people wanna build, and there's a new opportunity then to provide the
infrastructure and framework. So just like there was
Next.js, we created the AI SDK. You called out it has 4.2
million downloads a week. I think it's actually
gonna surpass Next.js. Next.js now feels old compared
to like this new hotness. It's like my new love interest. No, but they're complementary.</p>
<p>There's like a foundations cloud, and there's an AI cloud
that you can build on top. And so whenever you have an idea for an agent or an assistant, you will naturally gravitate towards a platform that
speaks your language, and that's what we're building now. Yeah, so you guys are
really at the forefront of helping developers build with AI. We partnered with you to make Stripe sandboxes
native inside Vercel. And I'm curious sort of how you thought about integrating payments within your stack and why it
felt sort of worthwhile to you. Yeah, maybe for some context,</p>
<p>my original ambition transcended Next or Vercel or the cloud. It was, okay, if I have a great idea, how can I convert it into a
productive software entity or business or whatever? And so my tool or my inclination was, look, JavaScript, I
mentioned when I was a kid, I worked really hard to learn English, but I also worked really
hard to learn JavaScript. And what I really liked
about JavaScript was it felt like the English of
the programming universe.</p>
<p>Of course, there's lots of languages. Spanish is not too bad, but English, if you just learn English, think about how much you can accomplish. It's awesome. Same with JavaScript. So JavaScript can run on the server side, client side, edge, build time. It can be used to
provision infrastructure. And now our bet is it's
gonna be the main language of orchestrating AI services,
making API calls to models, creating agents and workflows, et cetera. So that was the inclination, is like, "enable the world, broadly."</p>
<p>Now, a little bit of a detour has been, well, kind of like ironically, perhaps, English is becoming the next
hot programming language. So we created this tool v0 where it feels like a self-disruption. JavaScript allowed us to
enable tens of millions</p>
<p><strong>[15:21]</strong></p>
<p>of people to create, but that's
still a very small number. How many people can express ideas? So I'll give you actually
an actual proxy that I use. Slack and Teams have
approximately combined half a billion monthly active users. What do those people do
when they open Slack? They, generally speaking,
talk about building software or building some kind of business, and they go back and forth. "Hey, Emily, how much money
did we make yesterday?" And she's like, "Well,
what do you mean by money? Like, tell me exactly
what MRR metric you want."</p>
<p>It's like, "Okay, see you tomorrow." But we go back and forth in some conversation
around building a business. Imagine if we could take those words and actually more directly
and concretely build software. That was the original idea of v0. And so for us, it means that
we can take that pool of people that are in the creator sort of category from like 20 million to 500 million. And so we recently integrated Stripe because obviously what you learn</p>
<p>when people start building software is that they wanna monetize it. So we made an integration
such that every person that puts a prompt into v0 or creates an application into Vercel has a seamless integration with Stripe where you don't even need
to set up the environment. You just get this sandbox provisioned. And it even surprised me, but it quickly became our
third-most popular integration in the entire platform. It should not be surprising because anytime you build something, you need that flywheel of:
is this actually working,</p>
<p>and do people want it? And the best thing you
can do is sell that thing and get feedback from the market. So it's been amazing
because I think, jointly, we're enabling not just the
people that know how to code or are proficient in coding, but now the next generation of, whether you call them vibe coders or not, but it goes back to that original mission of enabling everyone to ship. Any sort of surprising businesses
that you've seen spin up with sandboxes like
that you didn't expect, you know, just from going through?</p>
<p>Well, there's a lot of people that are building, like, ideas. They might have a main job, and then they're like
building sort of their, like, startup, their dreams on the side. I feel like I've seen an
amplification of this, where, you know, for me, when
I was at my previous company, I was dreaming of the company
I was gonna create next. But I think the barrier- But you weren't building it yet. The barrier felt too high. It was too hard. That's right. That's right. And so I think there are
a lot of people now that, you know, one thing that's
been really surprising</p>
<p>is younger people. So obviously, I had this
story-my personal story-of like, I had to learn quite a bit in order to actually become someone that could sell something online, just integrating all the services, programming languages, et cetera. I've been hearing from people that are professional
engineers that tell me, "Look, my siblings, they're
like 12, 13 years old, and they're already
selling products online." So that's also been really surprising. The other one that's even
more surprising, perhaps, is</p>
<p><strong>[18:24]</strong></p>
<p>within enterprises, the same sort of inclinations are in play where people have ideas, but they don't have the
resources to execute. And so giving them a tool that can enable fast prototyping... One that was maybe not related
to payments specifically but was bewildering to me
is we heard about a company that went from v0 to patent filed just through like
prototyping, trying it out, going back and forth with customers, visualizing the idea, et cetera.</p>
<p>Like, okay, this actually
is a meaningful evolution of our business. Without a tool that allowed
them to move this fast, they need to like get
engineering resources. They need to do all these things. So there might be a
renaissance of, you know, it seemed like the only way that a enterprise scale could innovate is by acquiring a startup or by some people leaving and starting a startup where
like they were free to innovate and use tools and move really fast. I think there's a version of this that's gonna happen
within existing companies, and it's been exciting
to play a role there.</p>
<p>I can't get out of my head this vision of like a five-year-old Guillermo, doesn't speak English
yet, in Buenos Aires, sitting at a v0, you know, computer. What would you build? So it's happening already, right? So one thing I've been struck by is people send us like
the really cool things they build with v0. They share the chats in
our community, et cetera. And it's been amazing to see that a lot of these chats are not in English. Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, like, the LLMs just don't care.</p>
<p>Is it as performant in non-English? So this is the other thing
that's been shocking. So I've only had limited exposure, so I haven't done a rigorous analysis, but from my vibe-ometer,
Spanish is amazing. So that young Guillermo maybe
would not speak English today 'cause he continued- Wouldn't have needed to, yeah. building in Spanish. But the other thing that's fascinating is this is not a one-way door, right? A lot of people are starting with v0 and they're becoming
proficient engineers later.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me
like, "Do you believe that this tool replaces
the engineering role?" I don't think so, and I
already have enough evidence from seeing people telling me, like, "I spent three months in v0. It opened my mind to the different kinds of special skills that
it could develop later. And now I do this, and I connect to Git, and I use other tools. And I'm going towards that
journey of proficiency." I don't think people should
necessarily stop at prompting. In fact, this is how I
quote, unquote, "code" today.</p>
<p>Whenever I have an idea, it's actually way more practical
for me to put it into v0 and send a prototype to my team than try to express the
same idea either in Slack or text messages or whatever. Or, you know, sometimes
the friction to coding and creating an environment,
it's just too high. And so I think these tools
will continue to coexist</p>
<p><strong>[21:25]</strong></p>
<p>in order to help people
dream up really big things. Okay, so your own developer
experience- Vercel's obviously known for an
incredible developer experience. AI is changing what it
means to be a developer. What do you think good
developer experience is gonna look like a year out, two years out, three years out? Yeah, one thing that's definitely changed in how we operate
internally is that we talk of the LLM as our customer. So it used to be that I designed
Next.js only for people, and the persona that I
would imagine in my head is, all right, there's this developer.</p>
<p>Maybe they've had some exposure to PHP. Maybe they know some HTML. How can I relate to them? In fact, and I haven't
shared this too broadly, but the very first version of Next.js looked a lot like a templating language 'cause I really badly wanted
to merge the world of React, which seemed a little divorced from the mainstream of
programming at the time, and I wanted to make it super relatable. I wanted to make it like MySpace codes. I wanted to make it like,
"Oh, it just looks like HTML with some JavaScript logic on top."</p>
<p>Or even Shopify Liquid looks
a little bit like this. And so my customer was that developer. And, whenever I design something, I try to think of a very
broad range of skillset. This has been sort of like a
personal mantra that I have. I call it progressive
disclosure of complexity, which is actually something
that's really hard to do. How many years old is Stripe? I mean, it depends when you count from but like slightly over a decade. Okay, so in ten years,</p>
<p>a company will add more
and more complexity commensurate to the customers that come in and the deals that they make. So, if Stripe is supporting Shopify, the needs of Shopify are way more advanced than the needs of a one-person shop. So, how do you maintain the simplicity of the early days, when it was mostly used by one-person shops, ten years in? And so my personal rule
is, one, it's possible. It requires a ton of work, but the rule is progressive disclosure</p>
<p>of complexity or sophistication, meaning you still should present yourself where you meet the needs and complexity and experience of that customer that comes in through the door. And then over time, if needed, you reveal your more complex self. And so I think there's a
version of that happening now where, in order for me to
make a product that is good for one person or a one-person team or we now host two of the top 20 websites on the internet by traffic,</p>
<p>I need to be very, very cognizant of how do I expose the
complexity to the end user. But, again, that end user
is no longer just a human. We think of the agent and how is the agent
gonna reason through this. Little example from literally last night. One of our framework builders that works on what do we call agentic
developer experience, he said, "Look, what happens</p>
<p><strong>[24:25]</strong></p>
<p>when agents use Next.js is that they will boot up lots
of dead servers and kill them and boot up lots of dead
servers and kill them." And this is not a behavior
that a human does. A human boots up one. They go to work to their
tech center, that's it. And, in some ways, agents are better because they try lots of
things really quickly, and if you give them rope, they'll do a lot of stuff in parallel. And so what we realized is that in one error message in Next.js, we had to include the process ID in order to give agent context
of what process to kill</p>
<p>in order to recover the port that the previous process was using. This tiny amount of information- hashtag and then
identifier of the process- is enough to boost the developer
experience, not for people, maybe actually marginally for people 'cause like what I would do
if I was an engineer is like, oh, I would run PS and then grab my Next and then find the process and whatever. Like, not a huge difference for people can make a gigantic
difference for agents. And so, as developer
tools continue to advance,</p>
<p>they will continue to cater
to this LLM that calls tools and commands rather than people. The people will still be behind
the agent instructing it. The other metaphor that
I use is that, you know, instead of thinking of
yourself as a junior engineer that joins a company, you're basically like a
junior engineering manager that joins a company, and what you're managing
is a fleet of agents. I like successively revealing complexity. I'm wondering if that works
in personal life as well. Yeah, I meet you</p>
<p>and we start talking about
something basic, shared, and then we can end up talking
about like colonizing Mars. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's talk about business models. Business models in the
AI era are different, unique, complex. I'm curious how you've thought about Vercel's own monetization
strategy, business model, and kind of what you're
seeing in the market with all the businesses being built on v0. Yeah, when you engineer platforms, some of the early decisions that you make can be highly regrettable in the future.</p>
<p>One of them is how you structure. I think a lot of people that have built products
might relate to this, for example, how you
structure users, teams, organizations, workspaces,
roles, et cetera. You make some decisions, and then you wake up five years later, and you're like, "Oh, I wish
I'd done it differently." And I think there's a version
of this with pricing models. So if young, five-year-old Guillermo in Argentina was asking me today like, "What advice do you have for like how I should structure
my pricing?" I would say- I feel like that's a question
you might have asked.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally, especially because I would
be chatting with the LLM, and the LLM would be like, "Yeah, you have to think about this." But so, for a couple rules of thumb. So one is optimizing for
high-iteration velocity, not just of your product, but your pricing and packaging
and the way you bill. Like, it's gonna undergo constant change. Another one is optimizing
for transparency.</p>
<p><strong>[27:26]</strong></p>
<p>One of the big weapons that
Vercel has today relative to old incumbents is that you can buy
anything off the shelf, and then we transparently tell
you how much it costs down to a very specific unit, request, data transfer unit, token of AI. And the world has very much
evolved to this way of buying, where you have a session
with an agent like v0, and then we tell you like, this part of the conversation literally costs you this many credits because you used up this
much of intelligence. So, we very much live in a world
where everything is on tap.</p>
<p>Intelligence is on tap and power. I think of cloud computing as power. I almost think of what
Vercel does as a utility. You want us to scale to
infinite concurrency. So, for example, we host all
of the prediction markets. We host Polymarket, Kalshi, and a bunch of the crypto ones. Today they're probably
having a massive day. Why? Because everyone's hitting refresh on the New York election. I'll probably do it
when I leave this room.</p>
<p>Hey, I could see you're antsy. You wanna know what's happening. And so Vercel is
basically letting you draw as much power as you need. And we do it in a way that
they didn't need to call 'em and say, "Hey, there's
an election coming up. Can you just give me a
little bit more power, bro?" No, it's like on demand, and that means that we need to optimize for a system of enormous transparency, real-time accounting. So you can go to Vercel and-at any time, in real time-see, all right, how many requests, how many compute microseconds. Same for the build process.</p>
<p>So, if you have 100
engineers or one engineer, we can provision one build
unit or 100 build units. Your team grows. You can draw more compute. The same is happening with tokens, right? There's some engineers at your company that will be having very long
sessions with the agents. There's some that are
gonna be more parallel. There's some people
that, you know, frankly, as much as I am agent-pilled, I have some engineers working
in some frontier domains where AI gives them no returns today, people working on very advanced compiler</p>
<p>or cloud infrastructure that there's just not
enough data or whatever. And so you need this very
fluid model of accounting, billing, et cetera. And so what I would be thinking today when you think about your pricing model and how you monetize is- especially if there is
an intelligence component or a power component- how do you do some of that
real-time transparency back to your customer? But also, the SaaS models
are still very relevant. There's a lot that is
rightfully metered by seat or by project or by
some other kind of unit.</p>
<p>So, where Vercel exists today
is kind of a hybrid world of this very much on demand and also for some things
that are more related to collaboration, other
aspects of building software, more traditional like you would pay for GitHub or Figma or others. And, of course, Stripe has
evolved to meet this level</p>
<p><strong>[30:26]</strong></p>
<p>of complexity.
Yeah, we do. We see a lot of this hybrid
billing model, right? You want the sweet, sweet ARR, but you also don't wanna
charge the same amount to the person who's using, you know, in browser base like
a couple hours a month as the person who's using
thousands of hours a month. And, I'll tell you, sometimes
entrepreneurs can get into a little bit of a cold-start problem because if you do everything on demand, then you might have 100,000 customers that pay you like 3 cents a month. And you have fixed platform costs. You have platform costs because you had to like get
something up and running in order to just be online
and serve your user base. And that's why I'm actually,</p>
<p>number one, I'm a fan of
extreme experimentation. I think no one really knows the answer to these hard problems, and so you have to get out
there and try many things. But the other one is that I
think I'm quite open-minded about like more of the hybrid ways, and obviously it's great that, you know, you have a lot of the
infrastructure already built. So doing it for yourself
I do not recommend. It's quite hard. I wanna jump back to
something you said earlier about like the web
today is built on pages. Pages aren't going anywhere, but there's kind of a
new dominant interface that's popping up.</p>
<p>We didn't really talk about... We talked a little bit about
what that's gonna demand from the infrastructure layer. We didn't really talk about
what that's gonna demand in terms of new protocols, and I'm curious sort of
what's top of mind for you. Yeah, one thing I mentioned briefly is if the programming language
of tomorrow is human, that means that you'll
likely be integrated into a lot of the places where the conversations
are already happening. So, if you and I are chatting on WhatsApp, then we might create a group with a bot that is there in WhatsApp,</p>
<p>or if we're in Slack, same thing. So, the interface that has been the poster child of this first era of AI is conversation, in talking to these agents, in prompting, and I expect that to continue. What's also true is that a lot of these platforms already exist. So there's already ChatGPT. There's already Grok. There is already v0. There's already Cursor. And so paying attention to the protocols that allow you to meet
customers where they are.</p>
<p>Literally, this morning I
was getting a really nice- I was telling you about it- pitch about a data AI company. And the founder's making the case that one of the key interfaces for his product is gonna be the MCP server because a lot of companies are building their own AI interfaces. I meet a lot of enterprises that have basically their
own internal ChatGPTs. We have one at Vercel. You guys have one. Shopify has one. And so your product might not have a pixel interface, per se. You might just come to
the company and say,</p>
<p>"Hey, Stripe, if you connect
to our MCP server over here, you're gonna get this value from us." So, I'm paying a lot of attention to MCP. We have a lot of customers in e-comm. Black Friday is gonna
be a huge day for us, also for Stripe, of course. And a lot of the questions that I get are, "How do I survive and thrive in an age of agentic browsers?"</p>
<p><strong>[33:27]</strong></p>
<p>Meaning, you know, the
customers tells it like, "Get me this beautiful black sweater." It's a beautiful black sweater. Do you think agent commerce
is overrated or underrated? I thought you were gonna ask
me, "Where do you get it?" No, I don't need one, but it looks- I don't think agent commerce is overrated because I think, at least for myself, I always get the same things, the same black shirts 200 times a year, and so there is a kind
of purchase that you make that is very predictable. Again, context is king, always has been, even more so now within in the age of AI. That little example that I gave you</p>
<p>of like we improved the
Next.js error message by five characters, and all of a sudden, like,
the world works way better- the same is true for
how you bring context. That's just a way of
doing context engineering. The concept that we put into the agent determines the quality of the outcome. For commerce, I think if
you have really good context in like what my preferences are
and my history of purchases, there's a lot that you can automate. I expect it to play a role
even in the world of pixels because what a lot of merchants- the dragon that they've been chasing and have never quite gotten to-</p>
<p>is that you open favoriteshop.com, and it knows exactly what you want instead of a generic static page. This is literally why Vercel like... A lot of our business,
why it's so successful, is we helped people not ship static pages and dynamically render and personalize. But I think a lot of these pages and interfaces are gonna be LLM-backed. So, imagine behind the
scenes of producing a page, there's an LLM with a lot of context. And imagine that the tool
calls that it can make is the orchestration
of your UI components.</p>
<p>So, all of a sudden when I
go to, you know, keith.com, the LLM is producing the page. That's the mental model that I have. Now, some people are
gonna go to keith.com. Some people are gonna go to chatgpt.com. And so you need both. You need the protocol to
integrate it into big chat, and you also need to,
yourself as a business but also the way that you
should think about it, is empowering the businesses that also wanna maintain
their own interfaces with the customer. And with this new customer that's the LLM, both at the same time?</p>
<p>Yeah, the customer might be an LLM. The customer might be a traditional user. The way that I think about it
is when I go to the airport, and I walk past my favorite store, I might still be inclined to have a human-centric experience. So I walk in and I explore, and ideally I would want
that to be hyper-personalized and tailored to me. Another interface will
be the agent browser, meaning I tell it like, "Get
me my black sweater again," and it just goes off and gets it. And then the other interface
will just be purely the agent that you're not directly interfacing with but some other agent.</p>
<p>So this is kind of the
agent-to-agent model. There's an e-commerce agent over here, but I'm interfacing with some other agent that in order to fulfill its purpose, it needs to buy something. We did a little demo. I mean, this sounds like science fiction, but we did a little demo
of this with Stripe, where imagine that you're coding, and you're talking to a coding agent, and you tell it, "Deploy." And the agent-you haven't made
a deployment decision yet-</p>
<p><strong>[36:30]</strong></p>
<p>the agent says, "Well,
in order to deploy it, I'm gonna use Vercel
'cause it's the best." How does that agent successfully
procure a Vercel account and pay for it, so that what it gives you is actually the outcome that you wanted? You wanted a live URL or
you wanted a deployment, and it just fulfilled the
commercial transaction as an implementation detail. Obviously, you will want oversight. You want your payment methods
to be, you know, persisted. You want fraud prevention. You want all the good things of buying, but think of it as like my
assistant is doing the purchase.</p>
<p>I mean, there's disproportionate
talk of agentic commerce in the B2C context, but I think the B2B is
far under-discussed, and procurement could look
very different a year from now. Amazing, that is all
we have time for today, and a huge thank you to Guillermo
for the insights shared. I know I'm walking away with a lot and hope you all are too.
- Thank you all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:01]</strong></p>
<p>Hello, this is a walkthrough of Stripe Checkout, a pre-built payment page that helps you quickly accept online payments. Whether you're selling products, subscriptions, or services, Checkout makes it easy to convert more customers with a payment experience that's optimized for conversion, security, and ease of use. In this video, we'll cover how Stripe Checkout works, how to choose between Stripe hosted and embedded Checkout, how to add features that boost your conversion rates, and developer resources. Let's get started. Stripe Checkout is a pre-built payment form that's designed to convert more</p>
<p>customers and reduce development time. Stripe offers two ways to integrate checkout, hosted and embedded. With hosted checkout, [music] customers complete payment on a page hosted by Stripe. Just redirect your customer to the checkout URL and Stripe handles the rest, including security compliance and optimized payment flows. [music] This is the simplest option with minimal code required. With embedded checkout, the payment form appears directly on your website, giving you more control over the customer experience.</p>
<p>Whether you use hosted or embedded, Checkout uses AI models to dynamically surface the most relevant payment methods based on many onsession signals [music] such as popularity among other customers, as well as showing prices in their local currency. Checkout also handles tax collection, supports subscriptions, and can be customized with your branding. Let's walk through how to start integrating with Checkout. All Checkout integrations use the Checkout Sessions</p>
<p>API to create payment pages. If you want to use Stripe Hosted Checkout, add an endpoint on your server that creates a checkout session on your website. Add a button that calls your server endpoint and redirects your customers to the Stripe hosted payment page. Your customers complete payment on Stripe secure page and are then redirected back to your site. For embedded checkout, which appears directly on your website, you'll use the checkout sessions API to also create an embedded form. [music]</p>
<p>If you don't want to start from scratch, you have two options. Quick starts located in Stripe docs are full working code samples of checkout integrations [music] in various front-end and backend languages. Simply select your preferred language [music] and follow the step-by-step guide that combines both server and client implementation. Then download a full sample app or install the Stripe VS Code extension to get step-by-step help from our AI assistant as you add the integration to your codebase. Or you can start with sample projects</p>
<p>that demonstrate checkout in real world scenarios. These samples include complete [music] applications for both hosted and embedded checkout with source code available on GitHub that you can clone and customize. Whichever way you choose to get started, Stripe provides developer tools such as the Stripe CLI and Workbench. These tools help you test the [music] complete payment flow, including successful payments and handling postpayment</p>

<p>Hello, this is a walkthrough of Stripe payment links. A simple way to start accepting online payments in minutes without writing code. Choose payment links if you want to sell online without a website or accept payments in person via QR code. In this video, we'll cover how to create a payment link, how to share it with customers or embed it with a buy button on your website, and how to configure your checkout experience with multiple payment methods. To get started, log into your Stripe dashboard. From the dashboard sidebar, click payments, then select payment</p>
<p>links. Then on the payment links page, click new to get started. You can choose between selling products or subscriptions at a fixed price or allow customers to choose what they pay. For this example, let's sell a product at a fixed price. Select products or subscriptions. You can add an existing product from your catalog or create a new one. To create a new product, click plus add new product. Enter the product details, including any images and descriptions, and set your price. You can offer one-time purchases or</p>
<p>recurring subscriptions. For subscriptions, you can set billing intervals like monthly or yearly and offer free trials. You can also automatically calculate and collect the right amount of tax with Stripe Tax. Once you've configured your product, click create link to generate your payment link. After creating your payment link, you can share it multiple ways. Copy the link to share via email, messaging apps, text to pay, or social media. You can also generate a QR code that customers can scan with their</p>
<p>phone. To use your own domain, go to business settings in the dashboard and add a custom domain for your payment links. If you have a website, you can embed a buy button or card widget on your site using your payment links. After creating your link, click buy button to customize its design and generate the code to paste into your site. When customers click the button, they'll see your Stripe hosted checkout page. Payment links automatically support over 75 payment methods, helping you convert more customers globally. Payment links</p>
<p>also support Link, a wallet built by Stripe. Link allows returning customers to pay with a single click using their stored payment information. The payment link uses AI models to dynamically surface the most relevant payment methods based on many on session signals such as popularity among other customers. For example, customers in Germany will see options like SEPA debit while customers in South Korea might see options like Samsung Pay. You can configure payment methods from the</p>
<p>dashboard. That's how you can use Stripe payment links to sell online without writing code. Create an account or log in to get started.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:02]</strong></p>
<p>Hello, this is a walkthrough of Stripe billing, a solution that helps you launch any revenue model quickly. Use billing if you offer subscriptions, bill on usage, or need to generate invoices. In this video, we'll cover how to set up subscriptions and usage based pricing, how to create and send professional invoices, and how to try to recover revenue from failed payments using Stripe Billings recovery tools. This video is forformational purposes only and shows one example of a configuration. Your configuration might require additional steps depending on</p>
<p>your region and local regulations. Let's get started. Stripe billing lets you create and manage subscriptions for your products or services. Billing supports over 15 pricing models from simple flat rate or per seed subscriptions build at regular intervals to more complex hybrid and metered pricing. To create a subscription, you'll need two key components: products and prices. A product is what you're selling, like a basic or premium plan. A price defines how much your product costs, the billing</p>
<p>interval, like monthly or yearly, and the currency. A single product can have multiple prices for different billing intervals or currencies. After saving a product and price, create the subscription in the dashboard or by calling the subscriptions API. Once you've set up your subscriptions, [music] you can use tools like trials and coupons to help drive growth. For example, you can offer free trials to let customers try before they buy. You can choose whether to require a payment method at the start of the trial and if so, whether the trial automatically</p>
<p>converts to a paid subscription or cancels at the end. You can offer pricing that reflects your customers actual usage of your product with usagebased billing, a flexible alternative to subscription pricing models. With usage based billing, you charge customers based on their consumption of your product or service. This is ideal for services like AI models and applications, cloud storage, or infrastructure services. To implement usage based billing, begin by defining a product with a metered price.</p>
<p>For example, you might charge a certain amount per gigabyte AI token or API call. During each billing period, your system reports the customer's usage to Stripe through the Stripe API with meter events, which is capable of processing up to 200,000 events per second. Then, Stripe automatically calculates the amount due based on the reported usage and your pricing model. Customers pay only for what they use. You bill for the exact value delivered. Stripe invoicing lets you create,</p>
<p>customize, and send invoices. Invoices can be automatically generated for subscriptions, or you can create one-off invoices for individual purchases at an additional cost. To create an invoice, go to the invoices section in your dashboard and select create invoice. You can add line items, apply discounts, and include taxes. Stripe also lets you customize the appearance of your invoices with your logo and brand</p>
<p><strong>[03:02]</strong></p>
<p>colors. When you're ready, you can send the invoice via email or share a link that lets customers pay online. Stripe helps you get paid faster by tracking invoice status, retrying failed payments, and sending payment reminders. Revenue recovery tools can help reduce and recover failed recurring payments so your business can collect more revenue. With billing's revenue recovery features, businesses on Stripe recover $12 on average for every $1 spent on billing. Smart retries uses AI to retry failed payments at times when they're</p>
<p>most likely to succeed. You can set up automated email reminders to notify customers when payments fail, when their invoice is unpaid, or when their trial is ending or renewal is approaching. We'll even automatically update your customers saved card details when their issuing bank replaces a physical card. This helps ensure uninterrupted payments. Stripe billing can be managed through the dashboard for many common setups. For more customized integrations like automating subscriptions or reporting usage for metered billing, you'll use the Stripe API. Stripe docs have what</p>
<p>you need to integrate billing, including comprehensive documentation, client libraries in various languages and quick start guides. That's an overview of Stripe billing, a powerful system for managing subscriptions, usage based plans, invoices, and revenue recovery.

      <title>Companies applying emerging technologies to lesser known frontiers</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnzbIL-huR4</link>
      <description>Our users are bringing new technology, standards, and opportunity to every industry. We spoke with Lucid Bots, who save lives by building cleaning robots, or Archistar, who are using AI to speed up property planning applications by 50%, or Katalyst, who build fitness techwear that intensifies your training 6x. We also spoke to pioneers in their industries like Playdate, Atomic Industries, Light, Sorcerer, and Masquerade, who are innovating in some of the lesser known frontiers.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:03]</strong></p>
<p>In the year 2025 Playdate is very different than anything else that exists out there. Video game hardware projects? Kind of uncharted territory. Rocketry and aerospace engineering became a thing. Why did we not elevate manufacturing to that same plane of existence? The skill that we needed to actually make things is almost completely depleted. What we're trying to do here is actually preserve very precious trade skill and ultimately scale it. There's not a lot of software being developed around power and utilities. We're hoping to build the tools and the critical infrastructure</p>
<p>that the entire grid needs in order to operate in this new world. This is a unique product that doesn't really fit into any existing category. In 20 minutes you're getting a workout that's like two hours of an intense gym workout. It's doing the workout to my body and that's really different from anything I've seen over the last 40 years. When people talk about permitting, it sounds simple. Design your building. Get your permit. Proceed. In reality, that permitting process can take longer than actually building the house. We built the Archistar platform to generate building designs</p>
<p>that comply with the local city rules. And that has never happened before. Every four days somebody passes away cleaning a building in the United States. So we started with building a drone that can clean buildings. We've had to solve problems that others haven't addressed. How do we get a drone to fly with stability in the most complicated environments where most drones quite simply can't? Weather forecasting was one of the first fundamental problems that humans have tried to solve with technology. The ways in which we collect that data hasn’t changed much since the eighties. Masquerade is an original show</p>
<p>inspired by Phantom of the Opera but in a way you've never experienced it before. We invented technology for this show. The way the microphones are triggered across six floors, across six casts, the cueing of all the music. It's so madly technical, and yet it's all designed to feel like it's just happening. About 80% of the world lacks accurate weather information. In El Salvador, a one-day forecast is about as accurate as a seven-day forecast in Florida. We can launch the</p>
<p>Sorcerer weather balloon from San Francisco and navigate them to pretty much anywhere in the world. They float for months collecting thousands of times more data. This is the first time in history that something like this has been possible. I can't really think of anyone that has tried a new platform with its own SDK and its own everything. There's something super special about putting that game on a thing that you're holding in your hands. It's like, oh my God, I made a console game. Price of power is incredibly volatile. Power prices will put cryptocurrency to shame. Explaining to customers</p>
<p>is really difficult. Talking to devices is very simple. We can talk to an EV or talk to a home battery tell it when to use power, when not to. We're shifting power consumption to when it's abundant, cheap, and renewable. Classically we're very trapped in a mindset where manufacturing is just cost optimization for everything. I can save a penny here,</p>
<p><strong>[03:04]</strong></p>
<p>a nickel here. And ultimately nobody is thinking about, if I could just make my entire product 10 times faster how much is that worth? We're here in the LA office to help the recovery for the wildfires. There are 12,000 homes that were burnt. What Archistar is doing with technology is getting those permits out the door. So that we can build faster. It is saving applicants 50% of the time to get a permit through. Not being in the Broadway arena was critical to the innovation that we were allowed to even entertain in our minds.</p>
<p>You are literally like this in our show. You are literally a foot away from these Broadway singers pouring out their hearts right next to you. This is truly frontier technology. We're tethered by a hose to the ground. So every foot I go up in height is a different weight profile. I need to be able to counteract high flow rates, pressures up to 4,000 PSI. You can go into an EMS studio and you'll see people standing in a squat attached by a wire to a very complicated-looking control panel.</p>
<p>What we've done with Katalyst is we've incorporated that all into a self-contained suit with an impulse pack that connects wirelessly to an app for home consumers. Every aspect of the suit, is tested by the FDA to be sure that everything's engaging the muscles precisely when you need it. When we think about growing at an exponential pace, Stripe's a really important part of that equation for us. We use Stripe Atlas to rapidly set up a US entity. We use Stripe We use so many Stripe products at this point. Stripe Connect to enable Playdate Catalog, Stripe Tax,</p>
<p>Atlas, Stripe Terminal when we go to trade shows, definitely Stripe power users at this point. Is there a record for number of services used by a company? Because if there is we will shoot for the stars.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tacit: Fingal Ferguson, Master Knifemaker</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD1bI4LGobw</link>
      <description>In this episode of Tacit, we follow Fingal Ferguson, a fifth-generation farmer and master knifemaker in West Cork, Ireland. Fingal divides his time between the farm and the forge, where he handcrafts knives prized by chefs around the world. His work reflects a form of expertise that cannot be fully written down or automated. You can study metallurgy or knife design on paper, but knowing when steel is ready to move or how a blade should feel in the hand comes only through years of practice and close attention to materials.

Fingal’s craft is an example of tacit knowledge: expertise that develops through repetition and proximity to other makers. In an era of AI-generated output, his knives show what machines still struggle to replicate: judgment shaped by experience, care, and embodied understanding. Tacit is a series about that kind of mastery, and why it matters.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:12]</strong></p>
<p>The biggest honor there is as a knife maker is to actually see some guy who bought your knife. And you see years later you go back there and you see the worn used handle and the blade from sharpening. Out of all the knives there it was one being used. And that's a beat your chest moment. The Fergusons make</p>
<p>Gubbeen cheese in the townland of Gubbeen in West Cork in Ireland. My name is Fingal Ferguson. I'm the fifth generation on the farm. On my father's side a long line of farmers. And my mom's side is probably more of an interested one of more worldliness. Dad has a security and amazing steadfast way of being so efficient and logical in such a casual way.</p>
<p>And mom was so creative and quite brilliant and such a strong character. My sister Clovis I jokingly refer to her as the white witch of Gubbeen. She can heal you through food. I have kids. I want them to be proud of where they grew up and what they do. And you know one of the Fergusons being me also happens to make knives. As a butcher</p>
<p>through this whole process I always worked with a knife. This physical object this thing that basically wasn't eaten and didn't disappear. All my friends through the cheese and through everything else, they were chefs. The tool of the trade to all of these people that I had come to love was the knife. Knife making in general is a very simple process that actually you can complicate</p>
<p>and simplify as much as you want. You have to find the metal. You have to make it hard. And you have to make it into the shape and put a handle on it. And there's no such thing as the best knife steel in the world. There's just the best knife steel for that one job. You're gonna forge out a thickness into this steel. There's a point where the steel is softened. It's annealed. It's in this point where you can bend and you can straighten it and you can do all these things to it. When you violently change the temperature of a piece</p>
<p>of steel and shooting it up to 1080 degrees centigrade and then crash it back down to sort of room temperature in three seconds,</p>
<p><strong>[03:12]</strong></p>
<p>it's so hard that it's actually brittle. It's fragile. So at this stage you now have a blade that isn't finished, but it has been transformed. Muscle memory is I think, to me, a knife maker's tool of instinct. What I mean by that is you're on the grinder. You're holding something in your hand. You close your eyes and you almost will automatically put it back in the same place, at the same angle, at the same pitch, at the same yaw. The whole thing. You're looking at the shadow</p>
<p>that's being cast from the light that's behind you against the product. And using that shadow as a guide to see how close or how far you are from the platens. It's a subconscious means of sort of knowing things and that helps you through the longevity of a process where you can disappear into that. Hello? Sorry there's actually a crisis</p>
<p>going on at the moment. Is there any way you could courier it to us and let us know the cost of that? Or should I arrange a collection? I suppose. I feel very connected to to the chaordic word. To some people that could be an insult. To me it's like it's a sign of winging it moving forward. And maybe probably moving faster than you should be. Hot, hot, hot. That is not</p>
<p>normally how it happens. The knives don't go off. They don't go stagnant or stale. So I need to basically know that I can stop here and go and prioritize the farm and anything else that needs my attention. And I do that willingly. You can see that there's a family relationship that leads me to a certain shape of the blade. I find that</p>
<p>your first impulse the first thing that comes to your mind usually 90% of the time is the one you should go with. The first instincts are very powerful. These are some lovely Damascus blades. I have some high-carbon steel ones here. These knives are worthy of a little accent a little twist. This is the spine of a Spinosaurus. I've got pieces of mammoth ivory. That little piece of it can slip in between the bolster and the handle. There is an element of personal choice. You're going to shape the handle.</p>
<p>This is all about ergonomics. There's a balance and there's a weight and there's a feel. There's a thickness you can feel in the fingertips. This step is something very unique to myself that I'm proud of because it's both functional but also visually appealing. At the very end when you feel like it's finished</p>
<p><strong>[06:12]</strong></p>
<p>really you're probably still at 80%. You have to go over it. You have to look at it closely. Find those imperfections. Test it. The fact that it can cut paper is one thing. What's really interesting is actually the sound it's making while you're cutting it. So there is a point of maybe tear, if that's amplified. It's one element of what</p>
<p>you're listening for. Or sometimes if there's just one little part of the edge that isn't quite right, you can hear it. And I think I can see a bit there that maybe I'd nearly touch up. So that's one of the knives. And then this is a knife I haven't fully sharpened yet, properly. Are you hearing a difference?</p>
<p>Slightly. And also one of the things that's kind of important and a nice test as well is the push cut. If I'm going to push on the exact same place as opposed to the pull, a pull cut. So all of these elements are are telling me something. So it's a tool. It's also fun and it makes an incredible mess. Beauty to me</p>
<p>wasn't somebody wearing a wonderful outfit very elegant and beautiful in respects of the eye of the beholder. Beauty also came from a wildness and originality and seeing beauty in something very simple and them wanting to master that. If I was to be asked if I'd mastered knife making, I hope not. It's lovely to see an evolution.</p>
<p>And I'm very curious to see how that evolution will be in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tacit: Christophe Laudamiel, Master Perfumer</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwyOvhRIpu4</link>
      <description>In this episode of Tacit, we spend time with Christophe Laudamiel, master perfumer at Osmo, and the creator behind some of the most recognizable fragrances of the past few decades, including Polo Blue, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce, and Tom Ford’s Amber Absolute.

Perfumery is a field built almost entirely on tacit knowledge. While formulas and chemical structures can be written down, knowing how a material behaves in heat, how it changes over time, or how a composition will settle on skin cannot be learned from text alone. That knowledge develops over many years and thousands of small judgments, many of them unconscious, shaped by experience and repetition.

Christophe’s work shows how mastery emerges through sustained engagement with complex systems. Tacit is a series about that kind of mastery, and why it matters.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>I want you to make me a fragrance that evokes fear. So fear. I think I would do something very electric like before the storm. We can do that in perfumery. We have molecules to do that. And even certain naturals like chamomile blue has this uncomfortable feeling of a very raw rubber, even. And, uh I think I would put some wet stones, like in a dungeon or in a medieval torture room.</p>
<p>Not that I know that, but- And, uh what would I put? I would put something a little dry a little mossy maybe. Certainly musty and something very unpleasant. So a clash. So in perfumery, how would I do a clash? Maybe patchouli with very wet or very dry notes. So you have the wetness, mossiness from the stones, like in an old cemetery,</p>
<p>and then you would have something very dry. And it's very unsettling actually for people. And we can do both. Oh look, this is the store. Do you like the store? Yeah. And look, what is this? I'm Christophe Laudamiel. I'm a master perfumer. For me, I'm actually better with things that have a lot of personality</p>
<p>and things that people want to make a mark on the market. I make signature scents. I'm the creator, or one of the major co-creators, of Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford Amber Absolute, Fierce by Abercrombie & Fitch, and some others.</p>
<p>From a very young age I was always exposed to a lot, a lot, a lot of scents. Whether it's in the tropical forest, in the mountains there, or in the mountains of the alps, or in the dormant volcanoes where I was born actually. My aunt and my uncle, they were working in the Michelin testing facilities. And you know that's where you run the cars over and over again. I loved the labs. And in the lab, everything has to be perfect. It's like a car.</p>
<p>Because if in a car you're not perfect. You go off the road, and you kill yourself. Michelin at the time was equipping Formula One cars. And after that Michelin equipped the space shuttle, the American space shuttle. So for me, I could see how when you do the best</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>then you get to some really cool project that's also that. And then you pioneer things because by doing new things, it brings another one, and then it brings another one. One thing that's been in my mind from the beginning, I wanted to create the Pixar of perfumery. I've always strived for people to understand that perfumery is just like any other art. You have to do your own imagination. Just like in front of a picture. When I smell something, I see myself somewhere. If you want to create for other people</p>
<p>then it's how to make something that triggers the emotion you want to trigger in that person. You don't learn in the school that. You learn in projects on the job. You have to learn psychology, basically. It's like a perfume psychology. I bring you a little carrot. What do you think? Mais oui? Look. I need to smell this now. You see? Look. It’s very nice.</p>
<p>Oh, this stinks. Look. You like this one? You like this one? Or which one you like? Oh, this one is good. What about this one? No, this one is not good. And this one is not good either. Only the one in the middle. Yeah. Very nice. Mais oui! Someone just wants the smell of jasmine when the bush is blooming on the west coast of California. When you extract a flower it never smells like the real flower.</p>
<p>Like jasmine absolute doesn't smell like jasmine on the branch. So you have to reconstitute the feeling of the natural jasmine. I don't want it to be too direct. I want the greenness of the leaves. And I want the- maybe a little bit the woodiness of the bush. You see? So maybe if we have a little. Do you see here? There you see nothing. But there's nothing to see because the particles are mini, mini, mini. And then you smell like that.</p>
<p>So this is nice but I think it's still not green enough. So what I'm going to do, because we see too much of floral, we see the fruitiness of the jasmine. Yeah. And so then I'm going to rewrite the formula. So I can write on the computer or I'm going to write like that. So I need to make number 16. Sometimes I don't know. And it's when I write it that I start to decide what I want. So ethyl benzoate, 10% instead of pure. Now I'm going to dilute it 10 times. But if I start to think,</p>
<p>to think, to think, to think. It's still thinking. But now let me think. This space here is like</p>
<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>
<p>my private painter studio. You know, you can have your big studio where you do all your biggest pieces of art and then you have your private thing like on the weekend. I've had this for many, many years now. Actually I established it in 2010 in another location, and I kept it with me. You see? I have all my medals from kung fu. And then more medals here from kung fu. Yeah, I like all this. And here I have my bed in my lab.</p>
<p>And it's very important because I don't make a difference between private life and perfumery life. When you are an artist, that's how it is. You know? And this is a scent spray that's from a friend in Los Angeles, a perfumer in Los Angeles. It is very eucalyptus rosemary. But I love scent. And I love to use them in different ways. I don't spray before going to bed because it makes me think too much. Whether on my skin or on the pillow, I would never spray. Because then I start thinking of the fragrance,</p>
<p>how it should be built, how I built it, how, no. It's a nightmare for me. I cannot sleep. Okay, 104, 525. I do have to fight against ingredients very regularly to make the fragrance smell the way I would like it to smell. Voilà. Okay. And then plus 45.1- I always say chemistry is non-linear logic</p>
<p>and perfumery is non-linear logic. We should put a bit of tocopherol in there. Do we have tocopherol? No. A molecule has 4,000 parameters to describe a molecule. Do you understand? Just one. You have a hundred in the fragrance. So people that are logical go crazy. In perfumery you put something you put twice as much and it's still not twice as strong. Plus there are so many parameters. So people get lost. You have to know which ones are going to be the most important that are going to make a difference. So there was once when you</p>
<p>and a collaborator discovered an unwanted wet dog note. Yes. In a composition. Yes. Oh, that was a nightmare. When there's something you don't like in a fragrance, how do you go ingredient by ingredient? So for instance, what we do, we would take the formula, like we have this one. So this one has probably 30 or 40 ingredients. We line them up here on the bench and then I re-smell them one by one. So you smell them and then you say, okay, could this have a little facet of that. And then you smell. You smell, you say, could that have another facet that's missing</p>
<p>and then together they do that? But I'm going to see now that I have wet dog in my mind. And the other day here at Osmo it was the I say the kitchen rag the dirty sponge. Oh, this smells. When that shows up, it's horror. It's horror. And I cannot think of one ingredient in here that smells of wet dog or one that smells of the kitchen rag.</p>
<p><strong>[09:02]</strong></p>
<p>And then, well, actually I can think of one, but it was not in there! So then when you don't find it in the ingredients or in a combination of ingredients in your mind, then you reweigh the fragrance. All the green notes and all the woody notes separately to try to isolate the culprit or the culprits. The perfume industry's relationship with innovation is very poor. The last revolution is the pump. Okay, which came in the seventies.</p>
<p>Tell me the innovation in advertising, advertising, fragrance for her, fragrance for him and voilà. And then the pump. Why don't you have perfumery in the news? Why don't you have perfumery reviews in the Wall Street Journal when something comes out? Because they're lacking innovation and they're lacking disclosure. They're lacking transparency. So journalists cannot talk about something that is so secret and you cannot verify. And when you scratch there's not so much innovation. Something around it.</p>
<p>Yeah, texture or maybe some tulips around. Yeah voilà, tulips around. All around, yeah voilà. Fantastic. I love that smell. I want the public to know that when you buy a bottle for $300 most of the time it is not because the ingredients inside are expensive. No, this is not because of the amount of fragrance in the bottle. It is not because you have to pay the harvesters in Madagascar or in Egypt. The charm on the bottle is more expensive than the juice inside.</p>
<p>When you create for these brands you get some interesting ones. But it's rare. I want to do exciting projects. And I want to showcase the artistry of perfumery. For this, you have to create jobs in the industry that don't exist. So when Osmo asked me one day if I wanted to join as a master perfumer, I said yes right away. Osmo is this new fragrance</p>
<p>design studio using AI and perfumers to create new styles of perfumery. We could not have been here a hundred years ago because we didn't have the science. We didn't have the knowledge. Now the computer screens about 300 million molecules. We are going to screen about seven billions. To do that it would take one perfumer 66,000 years. With the AI you get new fragrance structures. And there is always something</p>
<p>interesting in those structures. This is what you are doing in the lab that when I pass by I was like oof! I get dizzy. Actually, this started when we asked the OI to screen already a hundred million molecules. And the 301 came up. So when I smelled 301 it was actually very oceanic, very fresh. And I said, okay, we should dig around that molecule more</p>
<p><strong>[12:03]</strong></p>
<p>because we need new oceanic notes. And then the chemist and the OI working together sent to our table this 3 9 1 3 0 6 that smells of melon. I don't care how the OI thinks, I see the OI as another colleague that thinks differently from me. What also is really important which is unique at Osmo. I don't know one chemistry lab next to a master perfumer's lab in the world. Where's the- Yeah, this one. Oh my god. This is so nice. This is crazy.</p>
<p>This is crazy. You don't need to go to perfumery school to know how to do melon anymore. If you take that, it's a photoshop. Click the melon. Cut and paste, melon. You see this in real time. This is fascinating. You know some people when they feel they have done big things or they feel they're there. Me, I still feel like a student at university. It's like just one step.</p>
<p>And I don't know where the road is going. Make me a scent that evokes optimism. Optimism. So I would have something super bright, super yuzu, citrus, lemon but twisted. I love the smell of lime, which is underrepresented in perfumery. And optimism it means the base is also very strong.</p>
<p>But the base would come into the fragrance. So like strong woods or spices. Some spices I see them as very emphatic and very energetic and very warm also. For me, optimism, there's a big, big hug that takes you somewhere and opens your mind. So also abstract notes like floral ozone, like nitriles, like things like that, that brings you in the outer space. And you don't want to think of the past</p>
<p>and it makes you think towards the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ben Thompson from Stratechery on AI ads, the end of SaaS, and the future of media</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUSWtLu2RCE</link>
      <description>Ben Thompson, the internet’s premier tech analyst, joins John for a wide-ranging conversation on the mechanics of the internet economy. They discuss the origins of Stratechery and the "1,000 true fans" model, why Taiwan is the most convenient place to live (and the best Uber Eats market), and why the public markets are wrong to think SaaS is "canceled." Ben also explains why the US failure to control the TikTok algorithm is a disaster, why he’s a "crypto defender" in an age of infinite AI content, and gives John some very direct feedback on Stripe’s ACH implementation.

<p>Ben Thompson is the founder and author of Strategy, the newsletter that everyone in tech reads to make sense of what's happening. He's also heirly to the premium newsletter model that's become very popular in media nowadays. For many years, he ran Strategy as a solo founder in Taiwan. Cheers. Good to see you. Cheers. >> It feels like people in San Francisco have not properly discovered Taiwan as a tourist destination. Like, do you agree with that characterization? What's your recommendation? People always ask me about Asia and the way the way I always characterize Taiwan is there's lots of great places to visit in Asia</p>
<p>>> and I would also put Japan on the list. But I, you know, I like to think I went to Japan before it was cool. >> Yeah. Nothing against Japan. It's just >> Well, the whole thing with Japan is going to Japan pre-smartphone was a completely different experience than going there post smartphone. >> Like you think, oh, the subway system's amazing, the trains. Try navigating that with no smartphone and nothing's in English. Like like Japan used to be very low on English. Uh it's still lower than places like Taiwan. >> It's surprisingly low. >> Yeah. And Japan it just has the the way to visit Japan is you just walk like</p>
<p>don't go to like set destinations. >> Um where but the way I would talk about this is places to visit but the best place to live is undoubtedly Taiwan. >> The one word everyone says for Taiwan sounds not that impressive but the word is convenient. >> Like it is the most convenient place to live. So part of that is actually >> 7-Eleven has really good food. >> Well, it's actually downstream from the Japanese cuz Taiwan was a Japanese colony for the first uh 50 years of the 20th century. And it's laid out a lot</p>
<p>like why is it great to walk around Tokyo? Cuz Tokyo is all mixed use, right? That's how Taipei is as well. You have these big blocks where the exterior will be commercial and the interior of these big blocks is all residential and the first floor is all like small shops or restaurants, things like that. So, wherever you live, you basically have access to everything all around you. But the the I think the downside as a tourist is it's kind of an ugly city. Like Taiwan's kind of notorious for just these dumpy, dilapidated buildings and</p>
<p>you go inside and they're like palatial on the inside. Like Taipei is very very rich. It's like in the top 10 I think as like number of billionaires in the world or something like that. All downstream from building out China, things like that. It's a very beautiful country. from Taipei, 30 minutes to the ocean, 30 minutes to the mountains, East Coast is amazing. >> But if people listening to this are visiting, like I feel like one thing they should do is it's a mistake to try and use Yelp or anything like that too much cuz like you should maybe just try and go to a night market and follow your belly and see see what looks good and</p>
<p>like a lot of excellent street food. And so that'll be one thing is to don't try to over plan. Well, here's a problem though where tech tech has made it worse, I would argue as a tourist, which is uh Taiwan is arguably the greatest Uber Eats market ever >> because there there's amazing options. It's all delivered by scooter, so it's always like 10 minutes to get to get dinner and things along those lines. I think you were going to ask me about difficulties moving to the States. Not</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>having access to that is definitely one of them. But the problem is that it's such a huge market now that I think there are fewer and fewer restaurants >> in that a lot of these places actually just straight up close their storefronts are just ghost kitchens basically >> and all they do is just make Uber Eats orders all day. >> I see. So I mean famously yeah the um the restaurant economy in places like Taipei would have been really good but it's gotten worse because people are eating in more with Uber Eats and stuff like that. >> I think so. I think so. As far as the like walking around and just like stuff on No, there's still plenty of places. But there are like a number of</p>
<p>restaurants I used to always take in the wall beef noodles or something like oh you can't actually go eat there anymore but there are still Uber Eats. >> That's a bummer. It's like a separate problem. The the San Francisco problem at restaurants is that nobody drinks anymore and so the restaurants can't you know uh they've lost a major. >> It's so bad you you had to get a your own office. >> Exactly. We're trying just firsthand to uh uh to to fix it. >> Be the change you want to see in the world. Should people visit places beyond Taipei or they >> Oh, for sure. Yeah. No, Taipei is great. It's great to walk around. Uh, Taipei</p>
<p>101, uh, which is obviously very much in the news these days with with the the scaling, >> but you can go up the elevator on the >> You go up there because there's a massive ball at the top, >> the mass temper. Yeah. >> Yes. Which is amazing. It's like like I if you're into like engineering, uh, that's actually a very underrated thing. National Palace Museum is amazing. >> But the whole the East Coast in particular is is incredible. You like you drive there is a train but the driving you can drive like you're driving on the coast like >> coast of Hawaii kind of. >> Exactly. Uh the problem there's an incredible gorge called Turokco Gorge</p>
<p>>> that was really Yeah. messed up by an earthquake a couple years ago. So I don't know if it's even reopened yet, but I used to take people to that all the time cuz it's it's world class. >> Yeah. Yeah. It is impressive that they said we're going to build the tallest skyscraper in the world in like a very frequent earthquake region. So >> yeah, it's a big skyscraper. It worked out well for the Netflix. >> Yes. So you've talked a lot over the years about aggregation theory and really popularized this idea where pre-in often power would live with the supply whereas on the internet because</p>
<p>of the different you know marginal cost dynamics and things like that. Uh power will rest with the demand aggregators. And so Booking.com is a much bigger company than any hotel chain, you know, something like that. >> And Booking.com is the particularly interesting one because they aggregate all the hotels, but they are also aggregated by Google. >> So they're like Google's biggest customer even as they're also on the other side. >> I feel like Booking.com is a very underappreciated success story in tech. you know, they're a European company,</p>
<p>kind of much quieter in a lot of ways, but like if you invested a dollar in Booking.com and a dollar in Google 20 years ago, you made much more money as a Booking.com shareholder. And I think people don't uh appreciate that fact. It's a very well-run business. >> Um, but where I was going with this is how does aggregation theory apply to AI?</p>
<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>
<p>How does one need to update the framework? TBD to a certain extent. I mean this is part of the huge probably the the the one of the most angsty debates that I have internally generally which is open AAI's sort of welfare going forward. I put forward a few years ago that actually OpenAI could stop making models and be one of the most valuable companies in the world just because of chat GPT. That's their most that's their most valuable asset. And part of the problem issue that they have is that was definitely the case in 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>Um, but they never, you have to actually build the business model around that. And I've, you know, I think fairly famously, at least based on all the tweets that I got when they announced that they're going to launch ads, I've been losing my mind about this fact for a long time. And I think this is interesting. I'd actually be curious your view of this, which is there's this mindset in the valley of this skepticism of advertising and people have sort of like internalized that it's it's bad and evil. Do do you do you sense that? Do</p>
<p>you feel that? >> I agree. There's kind of a knee-jerk skepticism of ads and like look, you know, when I I'm a YouTube Premium subscriber. When I see someone uh you know, uh watch a video without premium gas. It's like what are you what are you doing with your life? And so like I get the knee-jerk reaction and at Stripe at some level as kind of the the anti-advertising company and like we're the opposite uh uh form of monetization, but I don't know. I have no particular um issue. I think it's like a very efficient form of monetization. It makes</p>
<p>a lot of sense for certain products. Um and so I think it's just different strokes for you're I think you're with Stripe. You're you're on the you're on the skepticism side. I think ads are amazing and uh and you know I'm talking my book a little bit. Trae trajectory has gotten tremendous traction just by not hating ads even though I'm not an ad model myself. >> Exactly. But you're a paid model. >> Uh well it's actually it's funny. I actually think I got a lot of traction over the years by talking about ads when no one else was despite the fact it's the most important business model in tech.</p>
<p>>> And I look back and all my early writing about ads was terrible. I had no idea what I but I just by virtue of talking about it was it was helpful. Uh the the reality of advertising is number one people if you're making a product in the world like strategy is very fortunate like it is definitely a new model or a new internet native model in that I have subscribers in like 200 countries right like I'm literally the whole world is my market uh and Stripe obviously helps helps make that possible</p>
<p>>> a few in the Vatican you know they're following along with >> I could go check you know I I would put the odds are very high that I do have at least one one subscriber to the Vatican. Um, and but where I benefited from is I was a massive beneficiary of social media, particularly Twitter. >> And that back in the early days, good days of Twitter, if you want to say whatever it was, uh, there was currency</p>
<p><strong>[09:03]</strong></p>
<p>in sharing smart links. >> And so if I was a regular provider of links that people felt made them smart, so they would share them and talk about them and be sort of back and forth. And so that solved my customer acquisition issue. Yeah. >> Uh the reality though is most because the other thing about about content actually is a point I issue to come back to >> is it's a something to talk about. It's it's something it's commonality sort of sort of between us that we can both read the same thing. We can both have opinions on it, sort of react to it. the sort of product that I buy on</p>
<p>Instagram is not what I'm I'm not going to like post about it or talk about it, but it could be tremendously beneficial. And they in theory have this those these small businesses or whatever they might be um or Chinese suppliers or whatever, they have the same opportunity which is sell to everyone in the world. They just need a way to tell people about it. As someone who buys way too many products off of Instagram, and by the way, one of the great things about moving back to the US >> is the Instagram ads are unbelievable. Like, I thought they were pretty good in</p>
<p>Taiwan. They're so much better in the US. Like, oh, this is the best part of living in the richest country in the world. >> Advertising. >> It's amazing. Like, I'm like, what what's this native content? Give me more ads. Um, which by the way, Facebook is very happy to do over the last 6 months. Um, lots of ads these days. But, uh, I get stuff that I never would have thought of. I didn't even know about. And it's great. It's amazing and it's a real benefit to me as a consumer who subscribes who for sure subscribes to YouTube premium and looks down on people who don't but finding things that I didn't know about that make my life</p>
<p>better. So, as a user, I'm benefiting. As a rich user, I'm benefiting. As the world is six billion people, most of whom do not have the disposable income that I have, much less you have, much less anyone else in San Francisco has, they get the same experience I do. and something for AI like when you think about particularly when it's so costly to provide and the free product is so much worse than the paid product >> of course it's a win for them to be able to get access like so to have a mission</p>
<p>of believe that AI makes the world better >> and to not embrace ads no I I agree with ads being an efficient form of monetization what do you think is the right way for consumer AI apps to do ads like uh you know chat just announced that they're doing ads and they're doing well. No, they're doing them as the very separate experience to the answer. >> No, this is why it's so bad. This is why I'm so frustrated with them. So, what they're doing is the bare minimum easiest solution >> like banner ads basically. >> It's banner ads, but it's based on the</p>
<p>context of the conversation. >> And the problem is that like they release like their ad principles, right? Which is our ads do not influence your answer. If you're using the easiest possible way to target ads, which is based on the context of the conversation, we're going to show you a roughly relevant ad. Number one, your market's way smaller because you have to hope someone starts a conversation that matches the inventory you have. Number two, you're getting into a my t-shirt</p>
<p><strong>[12:03]</strong></p>
<p>answers questions that my t-shirt is raising sort of situation where if the ad is clearly connected to the answer, you're going to raise suspicion in the users's minds about about what sort of the connection is. So I I would prefer if the ads had nothing to do with the answer. The way you get there is you build a meta style understanding of the user and show them stuff that's relevant to them. Like in Instagram, the best Instagram ads don't have anything to do with the stuff I'm surfing. It's from Meta's understanding me broadly. >> So are you saying that like the AI ads</p>
<p>should be more like Facebook ads than Google ads? And you know, right now the focus is on doing targeted ads that are related to the prompt, whereas instead it should all be profiling the user and who this person is and what their interests are. >> Yes, I think that would be better. It would it would present less conflict of interest, less uncertainty amongst the user, and it's a it's a model that I think I'm I'm not the world's biggest fan of search ads precisely for the reason why they work so well. I think there's a lot of confusion between organic, no, they're cannibalization.</p>
<p>Like why is it that I have to buy my own name in search ads, right? because someone else will like go go in there and you're getting a harvesting a click on the ad that would have been there sort of organically which is fine it works the search is providing a lot of value but the the the challenge obviously is they only have one space for inventory which is in chat GPT well sorry is the defense of Google ads that um everyone complains about the branded search and yeah you're paying for cannibalization but Google pays so much attention to search quality that the sponsored listings themselves have a uh</p>
<p>a ranking of them, like a relevance ranking of them. And so it's really just like the yellow pages where, you know, you need to pay to be listed in the yellow pages. >> That's fine. I I I I don't I'm not I don't again I'm the ad lover here. Uh I just think that meta ads are more broadly valuable because they're showing me stuff I didn't know that I wanted. >> But if the AI apps are to generate a profile of you, does that profile include the content of all your conversations? This is the thing. Isn't that the same? >> So, this is the thing. So, Deus is out there saying, "Wow, I can't believe</p>
<p>they're adding ads. We're not going to do that." Which is hilarious because the entire Gemini Deep Mine apparatus, what is it funded by? >> Sure. Yeah. It's a Google ad machine. >> It's funded by ads. And that actually is probably the ideal model. So, it's actually very funny. I was actually in New York City last year. Um, I was meeting actually I was meeting with someone in the office in in the shared office or across the hallway was like a was a hedge fund or someone and they came over and he's like, "Oh, long time reader. Um, you're responsible for our</p>
<p>worst decision ever." And I'm like, "What?" He's like, "Putting money in Twitter." I'm like, "I've never said to put money in Twitter." Like, that's always been a terrible company. Like, I I stopped covering them because it was such a bad business. And uh, and I'm like, "Oh, no. I remember what it was. It was when they bought Mopub." And my theory, my problem with Twitter advertising has always been that it</p>
<p><strong>[15:03]</strong></p>
<p>especially was very textual. I think text doesn't work as this a problem for the all this applies to the chat clients. Text isn't the best interface for ads. Obviously, visuals are are generally better. And there's also a posture. >> If I'm on Twitter, I'm like I'm ready to do battle. I'm locked in. I'm I'm searching for information. If I'm on Instagram, the whole point of like seeing an ad is I don't really care what I'm seeing right now. I'm wasting time. you're actually in a much better posture I think to absorb just like TV like you're sort of absorbing can absorb the ad >> and Twitter is like bad for that. So but but Twitter because it's an interest</p>
<p>based network at least in theory it should be able to understand a lot about you above and beyond theoretically having pixels and and SDKs sort of all over the web. And so my theory with the MOPub acquisition I thought it was a great acquisition >> because like oh they can harness signal from Twitter and manifest it in other apps through this sort of Mopub Mopub network. Now Twitter was incompetent so they did nothing with Mopub gave it to Apple who's now written Mopub to like like the top of the world >> but that was sort of my thesis and I think that could apply to to AI as well.</p>
<p>I think the ideal outcome for Google is they never put ads in Gemini, but they understand so much about you because of what you do in Gemini that they can then manifest that through ads on YouTube, through ads on Google, through ads on their other properties. And the challenge for Open Eye is they only have one place to put inventory which is which is in JPT. >> Okay. So, you're saying that Google could use uh Gemini to just improve the targeting of the ads across the Google properties and then maybe if you want to have ads in Gemini, uh</p>
<p>>> I don't think you need to ever put ads in Gemini, >> but but just if you did, you would also have the profile that Google has for sure >> of you from across the web and you could >> Yeah. And you don't need to have ads that are like making the user feel weird because why are you showing the ads about what I'm asking about? >> Okay. But in the scenario you're just describing for Google, wouldn't that have the same just like the, you know, meta is listen to your microphone conspiracy theories where when the targeting is too good, people get concerned like wouldn't you get similar issues? >> I think it's a madeup concern. >> No, it is. But sure, but like people people have it and wouldn't you have a</p>
<p>similar issue where if you're using the Gemini data to make better ads, won't ultimately the targeting be too good and people will find it weird? I mean, I think that that's a bridge that every tech company would be happy to cross if they came to it. >> I see. It's a thing that people say when you have very good target. >> I think there's a lot of like I honestly I think a lot of the the there's a real stated versus revealed preference about a lot of this stuff. The reality is is people like even the US think oh you could pay for Facebook or you could show people would rather see the ads.</p>
<p>>> Yeah. >> I think most people don't care in this >> a lot of tech and this sort of ties into the skepticism of ads. >> It's sort of an elite town. There's a wheat regulators. Everyone's thinking about these very theoretical things. >> Isn't it a bit of the challenge banner blindness where Instagram advertising works so well because it's a picture feed and it's showing you pictures. >> I think some of the pictures are like</p>
<p><strong>[18:04]</strong></p>
<p>commercials. >> So this is where Facebook >> with an AI app you're like looking for an answer and you don't want to look at the banner. No, it's a huge concern and this is one of the great ironies of MetaF Facebook is the extent to which they of course Mark and everyone hates Apple for lots of I think very justifiable reasons but Apple saved Facebook from itself like back in the day remember Facebook platform and there's like Facebook payments and all this sort of thing and Mark has always wanted to build a platform and if you're just an app on a</p>
<p>own. You can't build a platform. And the problem is that I think being an advertising based model is generally incompatible with being a platform. The whole point of a platform is you're letting something else shine, something else bring to the surface. You're just un you're you're the support structure for something to take over. So an operating system is not about the ideally it's the application on top of it that that you're using. When Facebook was forced to not be a platform but just be an app, suddenly they could be fully</p>
<p>lean into being an advertising thing. And think about a Facebook ad. Even back in the day was a feed ad or a story ad. >> Literally your entire device >> is all an ad. >> And somehow it's not a banner, it's a little thing on the edge. They literally have achieved permission from users >> to take over your entire device to show you a full screen ad >> every 5 seconds. It's amazing. Yeah. And they they were forced into it by Apple. >> Do you Okay, this reminds me of and I want to come back to the eye um</p>
<p>dynamics, but this reminds me of a view I've had that I'm curious for your thoughts on, which is often when tech companies become really big, they become really big just because the core idea works better than even the founders could have realized. And so Meta is a really uh big company because they uh have a feed and the feed got really big and they like were very smart along the way where they bought Instagram and they're like incredibly targeted good monetization but it turns</p>
<p>out people spent a lot of time and many people you know the P times Q of that with the feed and they monetized it very well and that's what got really big and same with Nvidia. It just turns out that the GPU market got really big and they sell a lot of GPUs and so maybe founders because they're often like high-powered individuals who want to have lots of new ideas, they're often thinking about the next thing or like what the second act or the third act is and everyone wants to in invent AWS. But I'm curious what you would say to the idea that just >> generally it's making the core thing</p>
<p>really big and there's more orders of magnitude at the top than you thought. Yes, I think that's always the case. And I think that sometimes people end up making something that they didn't want to make and they continually push back. I think Meta is the perfect example. I I my impression is Mark's not very interested in ads. He's had very good people along the way that have helped him build these ad products.</p>
<p><strong>[21:05]</strong></p>
<p>I think Meta has suffered from that because he has not been front and center fighting for actually ads are good. They are societal good. They get they are the driver of all the consumer surplus that tech throws off. Like the president uses the same search engine as the guy on the street or the same AI or sort of whatever it might be. That's because of ads and the uh >> probably not. The president probably used like a palunteer search engine or something. >> Yeah, it's probably worse. Um Google Google has left a lot to be fair. Um there's so much junk online, but the um does Donald Trump ever search? I don't</p>
<p>know. That's a good question. But uh but he's not made that case. And I think Meta has suffered because of the failure to make that case. And then you get things like we're going to do the metaverse. We're going to do XYZ. It's always coming back. We be a platform. Be a platform. And Meta is an entertainment company. I wrote this like years ago about the like I think this is actually it was simultaneously a good call and a bad call. Do you remember that Paul Krugman quote uh the internet's not going to be very big or the fact machine because people don't have much</p>
<p>interesting to say? >> I actually defend that quote >> and because it's actually true. Most people actually don't have that much interesting to say. And the I brought up that quote around 2015 by saying this is a fundamental limiter on Meta's long-term potential. As long as they think of themselves as a social media company, they're going to run into a problem with their feeds becoming insufficiently interesting over time. Now, >> uh, the move from kind of peer content to, um,</p>
<p>>> well, so that was that was a, if I might say so myself, a very brilliant insight. The bad insight was my prescription, which was they needed to do more with professional content makers, like more funding of like the Buzzfeeds of the world and share revenue, all that. >> Userenerated content. >> The actual answer is what Tik Tok did, which is >> Tik Tok is not a social network at all. It is a >> harvesting and YouTube, you know, the same sort of idea. >> It's like personalized TV. Yeah, >> what actually matters and this is a key thing people get hung up on relative numbers and what matters is absolute</p>
<p>numbers. So it is better to have.1% of your content is good if your content is like in the billions or trillions as opposed to oh 10% of our content is good but you only have a 100 pieces of content. That's actually worse even if you have a better hit rate. And so spurring lots of creation, writing the algorithms to to capture the good stuff, put it up there, that actually solves the Paul Groomman fax machine problem. >> And Facebook was blindsided by that. They were so stuck on their identity of</p>
<p>being a social network that they let Tik Tok take this huge chunk. It was their blind spot. Speaking of Tik Tok, I feel like you don't write about Bite Dance that much, and I'm curious just what your thoughts are on Bite Dance from here and the Tik Tok sale and everything. >> I mean, what a what a what a mess. Uh, I had to make a decision a long time ago. I I wrote about Chinese companies more</p>
<p><strong>[24:07]</strong></p>
<p>previously and I think there's >> uh it's too number one, I have to decide what what I'm going to be able to cover and what I'm not. Uh, I'm not in China. I was in I was in Taiwan. it is a different internet and there was too much sort of uncertainty and unknowns just in general about a lot of Chinese companies. I would write about them occasionally in the context of US tech companies. So I think I wrote about like WeChat and what it meant for the iPhone's relative competitive position in China, how it's different than sort of other countries. I think that sort of held up pretty well. Wrote about Tik Tok</p>
<p>in the context I mean more about Tik Tok I think uh in the context particularly this context of meta. Um, Tik Tok came up around the same time as the uh was was it Quibby, >> which Quibby was the example of that. Quibby was like it was actually right that there was room for a mobile entertainment product. Yeah, >> it was totally wrong about the content acquisition strategy. So even if they had hit rate was higher, their total volume was way too small. I follow them but not super closely. It's just a hard market to understand and the uh >> like Tik Tok's very relevant to the US</p>
<p>market. So Tik Tok Tik Tok I so I wrote the Tik Tok war basically making the case that the problem with Tik Tok and back then everyone was talking about user data. >> Mhm. >> Who cares? Like the the whole user data thing people have this view of like the East German Stazzy and like folders like going through people's datas like these are like vector databases with like numbers that no human can parse. like they're they're it's really quite anodine. It's just related to target ads and um I was very skeptical about that</p>
<p>being a forcing function in terms of forcing divesture or whatever it might be. The issue I had was the algorithm and I noticed I think it was when the Hong Kong protests happened and Daryl my then GM of the Houston Rockets tweeted like free Hong Kong or something like that and there's a huge meltdown the NBA games have canled and I noticed that on Tik Tok and this was from I tested it from Taiwan and via VPN from the US. Uh, if</p>
<p>you search for every single NBA team, you got NBA clips. Except for Rockets, you got nothing. >> Oh, that's funny. >> And I'm like, >> they got demonetized. >> There is there is a thumb on the scale here. And I started talking about it then and my I did support the ban of Tik Tok or the force sort of divesture from China >> because it seems fairly insane to have a primarily information source controlled by your chief geopolitical adversary. >> Yeah. saying like there's rules over TV station ownership and it's like not</p>
<p>wildly different >> and so I I you know everything's a trade-off of course I'm pretty well known for being a pretty stark defender of free speech and against censorship and my issue wasn't Tik Tok per se was >> tech the reality of China is >> the founder of Tik Tok of bite dance is long gone >> because he got called to the carpet for bite dance showing a little too much of what people liked which is mostly like</p>
<p><strong>[27:08]</strong></p>
<p>hot girls dancing and being insufficiently like showing the right things that the party wanted. It's in China's like the reality is China has the price of doing business is they get you know they're on somewhere on the the control structure they can tell you what to do and this just seemed like a very foolish thing to tolerate. Uh unfortunately um the US political process or fortunately maybe the reality is is the US process and system is such a mess. Can anyone really truly impact</p>
<p>it over time? Uh the way that it shows up messily is we somehow do pass the law banning Tik Tok and it didn't get banned and now it is sold but China still controls the algorithm. So I think it's a big disaster. It's also like what what can I say about it? I said my piece. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Um, we ended up in the worst possible case, which is we violated property rights and we did all this stuff that's ridiculous and we probably bartered XYZ for ABC and we didn't get the most important thing which is control the</p>
<p>algorithm. >> Has that not happened as part of the sale? >> No, back then still controls the algorithm. >> I didn't know that. >> Yeah. >> Good job by us. >> That does seem like it was the point of the spin out. >> Well, the data was always the was always the most uh salient political point. And so when I wrote about it, that was my point. like I don't care about the data. The issue is the algorithm >> and um unfortunately that did not care. Maybe I should have wrote about more but anything like all the politics stuff there was a period >> I mean thank god for AI there was a period I wrote like when I wrote aggregation theory a couple weeks later</p>
<p>I wrote like something about regulation. I'm like this is going to drive a bunch of regulatory issues and antitrust things and and all these bits and pieces. when that actually happened, the late end of the last decade. Of course, I was writing about it. I was watching congressional hearings, all sort of thing. And that is the close I came to quitting and burning out. >> I think burnout's not a function of how much work you're doing. It's doing work you don't enjoy. >> And at one point, I'm like, either I quit or I stop covering congressional hearings. >> So, I decided to stop covering congressional hearings. Uh, I only wrote</p>
<p>about antitrust stuff was super prominent and I've been much happier ever since. And maybe that's part of the price of just not writing about that is maybe I should have pushed on the Tik Tok thing more. >> That's interesting. >> I said my piece. So >> yeah. Is strategy very widely read in DC? >> It is. >> Uh yeah, it is. Uh sometimes it's gratifying. Uh it's great when you get called and asked for your opinion. Um or you know you get certain responses or you see impact. It's less gratifying when you get yelled at and people are</p>
<p>are mad at you. But fortunately, the key thing to succeeding on the internet is something I have in spades, which is a very high level of disagreeableness. So, you can yell me all you want. I'm not going to change my mind. >> Okay. But getting back to aggregation theory as it pertains to AI. Like a simplistic view you could have is that the AI apps are the new aggregators and so a huge amount of economic value will</p>
<p><strong>[30:09]</strong></p>
<p>acrue to them and that's it. You could also say that that's too simplistic in a bunch of ways because one of like we're saying the you know booking.com you expect it to return you hotels that you should book uh but you expect a little less of a commercial incentive from the AI apps and this is like a little more of an abstract technology where it's actually not trivial to insert all of the you know commercial uh incentives in the right way and any you come up with various objections and so do you >> well I think the ad model is is is probably the way to start</p>
<p>>> which is I just talked about before sort of the lean in versus lean back. ads are very tied into human psychology and like what you're sort of tapping into and people's response to that and how do you make something creative and in the short term >> you know technology often makes old business models even more powerful >> before it kills them >> right so you have something like uh you know suddenly you're a newspaper I used to be limited to my geographic area right >> now I can reach the whole world >> yes</p>
<p>>> oh wait a few years later everyone can reach the whole world yes >> I'm in pure competition I'm screwed. And that is certainly a concern about this model. If you get to a world of say agent commerce and the agents are just buying the right thing like and this is I think this is also something that has driven a lot of tech skepticism of ads. >> People in tech tend to be fairly nerdy, fairly obsessed. Uh they're doing a ton of research to find sort of the exact right thing. >> Yes. Why would anyone tell me what to buy when I've, you know, researched it</p>
<p>for two hours? >> That's right. >> Yeah. But and so like ads have no effect on me. Well, what if that sort of obsessive deep dive approach is now trivally available to everyone because AI is the one actually doing it? >> Now where where do ads sort of function? And I think this is definitely a bit of a be careful what you wish for scenario >> because what this entails is of course more transparency,</p>
<p>more details, more understanding sounds good. What it actually entails is sort of perfect competition which is a very sort of brutal game that can just wipe out entire categories. That's you know that's basically what happened to newspapers uh in many respects. So that's that that's number one. Number two, in a world of this sort of world, you're sort of by definition anchoring on whatever specifications or whatever can be measured, can be put down. And you had the old sort of Steve</p>
<p>Jobs adage about feeds and speeds versus like the feel of something where the intersection of liver what the what the does that mean? And it's just like well uh what it actually means is there's things that can't be measured and that don't go on an Excel spreadsheet and everyone you talk to acknowledges this say yes there's things that can't be measured and the way it actually plays out in practice is only the things that measured sort of matter. I think this</p>
<p><strong>[33:09]</strong></p>
<p>has happened to a this a huge problem with sports analytics is a great example of this where there I think basketball is my favorite sport. There's a lot that goes into basketball and winning that is somewhat hard to wrap your hands around. >> Like baseball's very measurable. I do think there's aspects about clutchness and stuff that I'm I'm that I don't know that are properly measured. But around basketball for sure, the interaction and way teams play together and how your effort on or your involvement on offense can affect defense or sort of back and forth and</p>
<p>and you see again and again like to take my you know I like Daryl my um I think there's a reason his teams haven't won. they've overoptimized at the expense of some of these these other issues and if you can't measure them they tend to get devalued and in a world of AI mediated everything how many things that can't get measured fall by the wayside because we end up with it's very utilitarian sort of goods that have no</p>
<p>soul to them. um sort of a silly sort of thing to worry about in some respects. It's like or it sounds silly, but I'm a human and I anticipate liking and preferring the humanity of things of all sorts in the long run. But you could say that um like e-commerce aggregators like Amazon and lots of others have led to you know fairly anonymous manufacturers of lots</p>
<p>of everyday goods uh the kind of Amazon basics type stuff and a much lower price point than they you know were at previously at still perfectly good quality. Isn't that Isn't that fine? This is where you throw my ad argument in my face, which is like actually it brings up the base level for everyone. Like your basic consumer, the access of items they have to in the like >> there's no soul in an Amazon basics and that's fine. >> Everyone thinks back to like, oh, my washing machine was so much better in</p>
<p>the 1960s. And it's like, yes, that's true. And also far fewer people had wash machines. >> And so I'm now like making the opposite argument sort of I will leave and you can have a one person. >> Switch back and forth. >> Yeah, exactly. You can change sides of the booth. Um you mentioned agent commerce where you know we obviously are are big into that and had our announcement uh with OpenAI um uh back in October. Where do you think that goes? Like how do you see agent commerce playing out? >> I mean the the contrast between uh your own open announcement and sort of Google's announcement I think is is</p>
<p>pretty interesting and speaks to what the companies are driving for. Openai wants to be the place you do everything. They want to be like the aggregator. I think a critic would say people compare them to Netscape. I think the better analogy if you're an open AI skeptic would be AOL uh where they want to be sort of like the interface for everything that you might do and it goes</p>
<p><strong>[36:10]</strong></p>
<p>through their channels and Google just as they were relative to AOL is like actually we want to we want to make equip everyone knowing that if everyone is capable we are the greatest beneficiaries because we still marshall sort of the the sort of front-end demand sort of in that regard. Now, how does that actually manifest in terms of commerce? The funny thing about tech is I don't think it will manifest in terms of uh airplane tickets, which is everyone's example like everyone can never think of a better example than that. Uh but what what is the AI going</p>
<p>to buy? What is it going to get? I don't know. I think I would like to think people will want to have agency in their buying decisions. But then again, I you know, we have like assistants whether it be like, you know, for work or whatever it might be and they make buying decisions that we're necessarily not involved in. And that I think is a good predictor precursor of what people will ideally like, do I really need to know? Actually, I have very strong paper towel ideas. That was going to be my that was going to be my but once I once that's</p>
<p>set, >> can that be sort of monitored and done? Um, so I don't know. I think this is a very unsatisfying answer other than to say it has big implications on things like advertising and on things like like is that going to be a viable business model going forward. Uh what margins are going to be available? Is there going to be perfect competition? Things along those lines. >> Okay, let me try this on you for agent of commerce and I'm curious to have you critique it which is sort of how I see things playing out. I think some skepticism is triggered by people pitching a very</p>
<p>far-end state with a lot of agentic autonomy. And so it's like please book me a honeymoon in Japan and all the activities or like no one actually does things that way. Whereas actually you should go from the bottoms up in some very basic building blocks where um step one is just replacing filling out web forms. That's an activity that sucks. No one likes it. And so imagine you find the winter jacket you like and you copy the URL into chat GBT and just say</p>
<p>please buy this for me. And that's a much better experience than going clicking around a site you've never been to before. And so there's just the agents doing kind of tool use on your behalf and everyone can create that. Maybe it clarifies there's multiple colors. Which one do you like? Uh but it's just replacing filling out form fields. This is by the way one thing that I am very a lot of people are skeptical of this but I I am very optimistic about which is I call like just in time UI >> exactly the the like >> it's a better UI. >> That's right. Okay. So that's like level one is a better UI for for kind of doing</p>
<p>an action you want to know. Okay. Then level two is better discovery in search. It is crazy that we've gotten this far in e-commerce with keyword-based search. like keyword-based search works really well when you're buying a book that you know the name of. It's like I want to go by this particular title. >> Um for a winter jacket, it's like I don't know, I want it's like a puffer,</p>
<p><strong>[39:11]</strong></p>
<p>like what's it called? And so instead, you want to be able to say I'm looking for a jacket, this kind of I'm going to this place, it's going to be this cold. Uh you know, I like these kinds of things, whatever. And so step two is just better search and the ability to search with parameters that like no existing search UI lets you specify the temperature of the place you're going to actually get you know a jacket of appropriate warmth. But that's obviously with a jacket one of the core things and so better search UI is kind of level two from our point of view >> right which I think is already sort of manifesting.</p>
<p>>> Exactly. you're already and like in the early usage of the kind of chat GBT buying experience I think that's one of those like super cool features and then level three which we haven't really seen play out yet is this idea again of a persistent profile of the user >> that anticipates their needs >> exactly it's like I want to be able to just pin things I like as I go along or maybe you know if I can share my browser history or maybe if I can just like you know share a Pinterest board of just like these are some styles I like give me a good winter jacket for the cold based on that here are photos of me uh you know based on uh this and so</p>
<p>starting >> well I have even better I have even better idea imagine if you were using chat GPT and it's circa October 1st and there is an ad for a great winter jacket that is perfectly suited to me because they've been understanding my interests they understand the context of where I am not searching for winter jackets because I don't plan well it's going to get cold and then I'm searching winter jacket I'm >> but what if it could anticipate that and show me an ad at the right time when I need to see it. >> Okay, maybe that's level four is like the uh</p>
<p>>> that's what I've been wanting them to build. This is my whole myth before. Like this is like this is why they're so late. They they should be shipping that this year. You're only shipping that this year if you started your ad product two or three years ago. This is doable today. >> This is what meta ads are. You need to be on more you need to watch more reels. I >> like like just the I've bought more ski equipment this year that I don't need just because it just shows up. I'm like I'm moving back to Wisconsin so I I'm buying stuff for the house. And I get, oh, those ski hangers. I bet those would be great. That sounds very useful. They're still in a box. I would actually</p>
<p>put them up. But >> yeah, so there's a limit to kind of with just um kind of banner ad type experiences to what you can do where I think the search thing is is very powerful. But yeah, I'm curious what you think of kind of step one just the very act of checking out uh and then or level one, the very act of checking out, level two, better search, and then level three defining your own embedding space of preferences. No, I I I completely agree with that approach. I just think you underrate the extent to which level three has already been built.</p>
<p>>> Actually, one of the thing that that um Mark Zuckerberg said on a couple earnings calls ago that I thought was very astute >> is uh we get hung up on technological definitions for like what is an agent? And he's like actually the largest and most successful agent in the world today is Facebook advertising >> which is exactly right. Facebook advertising, people have it in their head that you go and you put in like demographics and your targeting and stuff. >> No, no, it's very autopilot.</p>
<p><strong>[42:11]</strong></p>
<p>>> Yeah. What you do is you go in and you say, uh, this acquiring a customer for this is worth $10 to me. I'll spend up to $10 and they will deliver you a customer for $10. Yes. >> They'll their margin will actually increase because they will make sure they deliver it at exactly $10. They can do it for more and they actually make more money. You get exactly what you asked for. Uh it's I think the extent to how powerful this already works. They're just stuck on the 50% of my ads work don't I don't know which ones. >> No on Facebook >> they all work. >> Yes. >> I feel like a bunch of new very big</p>
<p>successful companies will be created in AI powered e-commerce. It just feels like a different enough product space. But what what you're talking about retailers, merchants or dis or a >> I was talking about discovery and um kind of the demand side though also probably retailers. >> Yeah. I mean I certainly think I I think that the the part that I think would be new which is a bit which you maybe talking about is this real anticipatory aspect which is right now what is amazing about to go back to meta ads is</p>
<p>it helps merchants who have a very specialized product find customers that they never would have found otherwise but there is the inverse of I need a very specialized product how do I find what it is which I think you were referring to before >> but to what extent can that not just being in the moment. I need this specific I remember I needed a uh a server a piece for my a rack to mount like this router cuz I had like an extra I didn't want to buy a whole new thing or whatever. I had this extra router and of course there's some guy in Australia</p>
<p>that does 3D prints that perfectly matches this on Etsy or something and it was great. I found this random guy I'm sure he made a bunch of money selling me a $40 piece that cost him $2 to make. Good for him. Uh but what if an AI should be capable of anticipating that need? >> So it's not I oh I have a need let me go find it. >> Yes. >> It's like I know you're going to need this and let me acquire it. And that would be very powerful. >> Mhm. >> In his excellent newsletter strategy Ben</p>
<p>often argues that whoever controls the customer relationship shapes the entire ecosystem. And in mobile apps, there's always been this interesting tension here with inapp purchases where historically app developers had an intermediated relationship with their customer through app store policies. Over the past year, that layer has started to open up. Mobile developers can choose what they use for inapp payments. Developers now have more freedom. But with that freedom comes new challenges. App Store payments were previously handling a whole bunch of different tasks like payments, tax, fraud, disputes, all bundled together.</p>
<p>Stripe manage payments is built for this new world, handling all that operational complexity for you with Stripe as the merchant of record. And with our new app to web flow, customers can check out in seconds in an experience that feels native. It converts like inapp payments, but it runs on Stripe. The public markets indicate as of</p>
<p><strong>[45:12]</strong></p>
<p>January 2026 that SAS is canled. Are they right? I think it's probably a mix. Uh the I think the one of the brilliance of American business is actually this is one of my theories about why the Europeans are so gung-ho about data privacy and regulation is because they so often interact with European companies. Yeah. >> So, like I was in Paris a couple years a couple years ago and of course going on</p>
<p>a tourist trip going to going to the Lou going to the museum or wherever it is like or not whatever it was seeing a bunch of museums. >> They all have their own homegrown registration systems >> and they're collecting so much data >> and they're like it's like yeah what's your age? What's your pet? What color is like it's like why do you need to know all this information? They're all non-standard forms. they need this is where you need AI to fill all this sort of thing in like what like there's like this theoretical idea in their head if we capture this data it could be useful so</p>
<p>they built these homegrown things in like the 2000s that are horribly insecure and I use them I'm like where's the regulator can someone put this is ridiculous so I get I get the mindset >> US companies don't do that like US companies are so good I think one of the big strengths of of US business culture is understanding and I think about this personally. This is what I give life advice. What's the number one mistake people make uh when they're young in particular? They focus on their weaknesses. Like I have to amiliate my weakness. Like no, what you do is you</p>
<p>double down on your strength. You get richly rewarded for that and then you hire someone to take care of your weaknesses, right? Like I'm I'm a big believer in the getting things done system. Like great book, Getting Things Done. Even if you don't use the system, the book is really good. Lots of great insights. There's this whole thing like tickler files and like all these sorts of things. It's an amazing system. I'm completely incapable of managing the system on my own. So there's a Mac app called Omnif Focus that is completely built around the system that I don't have a license for. My assistant has a license for and I text him stuff and his</p>
<p>job is to maintain my getting things done file because I can't do it. What I what do I do? Actually my wife is very very optimized around I write three pieces a week. I do an interview and I do three podcasts and all my focus and energy needs to be on that. And if I do that, that will make a lot of money and I can pay to fix all my problems sort of elsewhere. And I think American business does this very well. They don't waste time and energy on stuff they're not good at. They double down on what they're good at and they're focused on the upside, not on their cost centers.</p>
<p>>> Probably a result of the very large market in the US. >> I think so. And just the the competition, it would be in a very large uh common market. So you you like you you don't have your like you go back to like newspapers, they have lots of homegrown stuff. Like if you're a publication on like online, if you're if you're like me on the internet, >> I get paid to comment on the big tech companies. It's probably the most competitive market on earth, right? Like</p>
<p><strong>[48:13]</strong></p>
<p>lots of people have takes on the big tech companies. Uh and so you have to be super focused given that that speaks to the enduring value of just paying someone to manage these these business functions from a software perspective. Now, there's a lot of SA like there's a there's a lot of SAS applications. Not sure they're all sort of strictly necessary and and worth the price. Uh I like to think people talk tech. I would say there's a big six. >> The six was Silicon Valley Inc. which is basically this cookie cutter</p>
<p>>> VC goes to this founder addressing this specific business case with the SAS business model. Everyone likes to they get to talk about changing the world. It's actually the most predictable thing yet. That's why VC returns compressed, but because they're also very predictable in terms of like the sort of engine going. >> A big problem there is they're all seat based. Like anyone's seat based that some of that just there's going to be probably fewer seats. Uh and then if the replacement is more smallcale, uh ideally there's lots of, you know, the internet in general has</p>
<p>writing or content is a good example. There used to be sort of you want to be in the big pond and everyone in the big pond sort of ate. If you if you had a job at Kday Nast and one of their magazines, like you lived life well, even if you wrote like four four magazines today, if you want to be a writer, I give advice to people that that want to be content producers all the time. >> And I'm like, look, you don't want to be you don't want to be in a pond with me, right? Uh Bill Simmons is like the like first internet sports writer and you don't want to be doing a Bill Simmons impression on the internet because he</p>
<p>got there first. And what what you want to do is you want to make your own pond. The internet enables the creation of a million different ponds. So you to get to define your own pond, be the only biggest fish in that pond. That's how you succeed. To the extent AI makes that I think this is the upside case is AI makes that possible for more than just content for all sorts of businesses to be lots of smaller scale individual entrepreneurs or small teams all of whom don't really fit in the Salesforce driven seatbased model for a lot of these companies. So</p>
<p>there might be a big return to self-s serve um you know the uh or maybe they'll just roll their own because their their needs aren't that large. >> Um so that's more a larger structural change but the problem is it's fine to say businesses will be okay as they are. If you're eliminating the growth that's the big problem I think that that's the biggest issue for all the compression >> by headcount growth >> just growth in general. like what's if if these are just stable businesses with astronomical stockbased</p>
<p>compensation >> that is predicated on we're going to be very large >> I can see two critiques you might have uh of uh kind of the software space and why everything's traded down one is we're you know everyone's just going to use cloud code to rebuild their own version in house and so uh the software mode is less and the second is actually</p>
<p><strong>[51:14]</strong></p>
<p>just that many of these products price on a per seat basis and so if you're growing Headcount less on the first shrinking. Exactly. Yeah. On the first like anthropic just installed workday famously. >> Exactly. So I don't think um I don't think uh you know we're cla >> systems of record are are are is that that's the category. >> People do not seem to be um you know we see this with tribul as well like I don't think anyone's cla coding one of those systems of record anytime soon. Now we use workday. I don't know what to make of the second criticism, but again, it just feels like for a very broad and</p>
<p>deep system of record, it's kind of hard to make the argument that the business is somehow impaired versus a year or two ago, >> right? But but I think but I think that that's my point though is people saying they're going to zero are wrong. But if the assumption is you're fine >> Mhm. But you're not going to be growing indefinitely. Like that shift from thought of as being a growth company to being a stable >> I see >> that's a haircut and again it's combined</p>
<p>with these whole compensation structures. >> Yeah. You're now valued on EPS rather than revenue or something. So yeah. Um can we talk about your business and check? >> Sure. So you were very early to the I mean the sovereign writer um concept. Uh I think you were one of the first premium newsletters. >> Uh I think so. >> Yeah. >> Well well so there's two predecessors to talk about. One is just on Wall Street in general. There's a long history of faxed out newsletters and things on like</p>
<p>grants. >> Uh the difference there is those were very expensive and a very small addressable market. So, uh, the difference for Shaki is it's much cheaper and the market's much larger. >> Uh, the other person that deserves a call out, which I think was the first person to do it before me. Otherwise, I think I was the first, >> was Andrew Sullivan, who did uh >> I didn't realize he had a paid news. >> He did for like a year. >> The problem is he did it all wrong. >> You're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>>> Uh, he was like he would turn out like 50 posts a day, right? just about a gazillion different things. He totally burned out and like all this sort of stuff. >> But um that was happened to be a great fit for the advertising model back in the day cuz you would always go back there just always be new stuff and I'm sure he had a gazill I'm sure he drove a gazillion impressions for the Atlantic especially when he was with them. He went independent. He was pretty successful. I think he he did like around a million dollars or something like that. But it was a this very leaky pay wall. It's like after like 35 posts then you'll hit like a payw wall and there's a bit where you're like you're</p>
<p>punishing your your worst users. It's very easy to get around. Um, and so, but he was actually very inspirational in how I thought about the model in that he was hailed as a failure because he like burnt out and then quit. But I'm like, he made a million dollars, right? It's pretty good. Uh, I wanted from the and just think about the psychology of this. When I started Trajectory, he had a gazillion ideas of things to write about</p>
<p><strong>[54:15]</strong></p>
<p>and I limited myself to writing a max of two times a week. And the reason is I had the subscription model in mind and when I added the model I didn't want it to be I'm taking stuff away and now you have to pay. I'm like you like this so much if you pay you can get more and so I always wanted to be you're paying to get more sort of sort of aspect >> and I think that probably mattered more at the beginning especially because the model was new. Uh, you know, I had I had my metric I looked at was people who visited Shakri on days I didn't post</p>
<p>>> because they were people that were going there hoping I had posted that day and they were leaving disappointed. >> And so in this case, usually previously a payw wall would disappoint people that they hit it. >> In this case, the payw wall would >> leave their disappointment cuz they they they could now get what they wanted. And so I'm like, if I can capture X percentage of these visitors, it'll be very good. um one day goal, one week goal, one month goal, failed to reach all of them. Uh what happened was I I I actually thought it was not going to work. I was going to have to go back to</p>
<p>like teaching English or something like that. Uh the but it sort of grew and grew and grew and at 6 months actually hit my one year goal which was 1,000 subscribers, thousand true fans, you know, was $100,000 run rate and I posted a little >> take you how long to get to a thousand subs? >> Six months. >> Okay. And I posted a little note saying, "Hey, you know, model works. Reach, you know, my goal is a thousand for a year. I've already reached it." And this is the only step change in subscribers I've ever had. In the next 24 hours, I got 250 new subscribers. 25% increase.</p>
<p>What they were was I had identified those people who wanted to be subscribers. They just didn't trust that it was going to work. I was going to go out of business and take their money. And so once they realized I wasn't going anywhere, then they all they all signed up. And those people signed. So I actually had my my metrics were right, but I didn't properly calculate the uncertainty and people's fear of losing their money. Uh so I'm very grateful that now people just sign up for stuff all the time, right? Uh you</p>
<p>know, >> I of course I'll probably, you know, go to my grade being most wellknown for Shakery, but I am equally proud of the model and that lots of people make a living doing this. How far do you think this model can go? Like again it the the defining characteristic to me seems like the unbundling like you know maybe 30 years ago you would have been writing for a publication whereas now it's unbundling. It's the direct relationship with your subscribers. It's direct monetization and generally paid. I mean there might be some ad supporting</p>
<p>component as well paid. Obviously, kind of Substack has proven that this is a very broad applicability, but how far do you think this goes versus traditional media bundling >> there? I think there's a couple interesting angles to this. Uh number one, I think people including people in tech seriously underrate how large the internet is. And like some of the biggest push back I got when I announced like the check your paid product was from >> VCs. I won't say who. It's like love you</p>
<p><strong>[57:15]</strong></p>
<p>Ben >> just doesn't not going to work on the internet. Um the uh so and my bit about ponds before I don't know that we've scratched the limit of how many ponds >> Mhm. >> can be sort of built in the world and you can sort of occupy and and the other part of this the critical piece of this and AI is actually an important factor here is the key to the model is your costs. So you need just as technology enables you to reach everyone you need to leverage technology to keep your costs very very low. And so for the</p>
<p>first several years, for sure it was just me. So as long as I could feed my family, >> I was I I I was fine. And this is this is the problem for the traditional like media companies. Their cost structures were were not internet cost structures. They were they were predicated on on much higher revenue. And there, you know, and this is it's interesting to think about and talk about this because a lot of this it is like not really applicable. It's like before I write about ads a lot and I'm not an ad business. In this case, I write about VC highcalable companies, but my actual</p>
<p>business is very sort of boutique and small and artisan in that. Yeah, that's right. In that regard, and this is a super important point is managing your costs. >> If you manage your costs appropriately, then the possibilities, but that also means there's some things that don't work with this model. >> Like your traditional >> classic investigative journalism six-month sort of piece. Yeah. it it did it's not well supported by this. >> What did support that was the bundle >> having lots of different writers in one</p>
<p>publication altogether and the thing I worry about I wonder about is bundles are good for everyone involved and no one wants to be a part of it. So TV is the classic example. Why did we have a TV bundle? Because you had like so in I think it started in Pennsylvania. So you have like a television station in Philadelphia and you have the Alagany Mountains and you have a bunch of towns there that want to get the signal from Philadelphia but they can't get a good signal. So they</p>
<p>band together. They put up a big tower to get the signal. They run actual cable from that tower to all their houses. And all of cable television started in small town rural America to get TV from the big cities. And Ted Turner comes along like I could just broadcast directly to these towers. this would be amazing and you get the model and suddenly every but you had a for geographic forcing function and you ended up with all these companies with the best business model in the world. They everyone paid them whether they watched you or not and they made a ton of money</p>
<p>>> and what happened the moment they could do something different. >> Let me I could also go directly I could I could stream directly and there's just something about business and like cuz it's it's a it's almost like you have to be forced into the game the optimal game >> from like a game theory perspective and the moment you can desert everyone always desserts even if it's the best thing. >> Yes. And I so I wonder so I do wonder can bundles >> how does this apply yeah to your world</p>
<p><strong>[60:16]</strong></p>
<p>>> because in theory there should be bundles. Substack should be a bundle. Uh like you should be able to pay one fee and get everything. But they you know they started I think a mistake Substack made and I'm a huge Substack fan just to be clear. I made this creep before mad about it, but is they characterize themselves as being totally writer friendly. >> And I think that was a mistake cuz it's impossible for them to be ultimately writer friendly cuz the most writer friendly setup is running an open source software like on your own server like then no one could do anything to you. And uh by definition >> I thought you were going to say like the</p>
<p>most writer friendly thing is to have like a humming consumer business. It would be but the problem is so they they all their initial terms let >> made the bundles impossible and all the individual publishers owning their own subscribers having their own Stripe account and all these sorts of bits and pieces. >> But hang on isn't there like a I feel like there's a welltrodden path in tech here where open table started as like entirely it started as onrem purely software for restaurants and then they added the customer discovery layer on top of it. Shopify started as a solution just for merchants and then they added the shop pay kind of network layer for</p>
<p>consumers on top of this. >> Yeah. But what what actually ma even with those business though like the shop pay bit is nice. It's not the driver of the business. >> It's a pretty cool part of the business. I like it but it's but at the end of the day the vast majority of shop interactions are I see an ad on Instagram and I go there and I get shop the shop button which is incredible things. >> No. Yeah. But then it makes the Shopify offering to merchants so much more compelling because you get the shop pay network and there's >> I'm skeptical that's the driver of the business. I think it's a nice to have. I</p>
<p>think the >> but can't Substack just add a Substack Prime bundle on top of it and merchants can or writers can choose >> the problem is yeah the problem is the merchants who will drive make that bundle valuable have no incentive to join the bundle because they could make more just monetizing users directly. So imagine I'm on Substack. How much more revenue does Substack have to give me for me to trade $15 a month from all my subscribers for a smaller amount from all whoever is part of this this so the</p>
<p>problem is they have to really pay me off to be a part of it meanwhile everyone who doesn't have any subscribers of course they love to be in the bundle so so this is why the geographic forces >> feel solvable to me >> I I think it's solvable at the beginning >> no sorry it feels solvable now >> yeah I think a counter example is something like Spotify. Spotify is arguably the best bundle on the internet. But the reason why they were able to assemble the bundle is because they only need to negotiate with like four four entities. >> And so it's interesting because on one</p>
<p>hand that limits Spotify's upside because those entities are able to >> negotiate such a large share of Spotify's revenue. On the other hand, that's also why Spotify was possible because they only need to negotiate with four. >> Yeah. Yeah. And if you're trying to to like get every artist on earth >> Yeah. >> where you Well, of course I got to get Taylor Swift. Okay, good luck with that. Oh, all the small fry will sign up. But</p>
<p><strong>[63:18]</strong></p>
<p>and the music's unique in particular because you music the moment a song comes out >> is now part of the back catalog. It actually people only ever listen to back cataloges. Uh so that it's a particularly unique industry in that regard. But that is a bundle that formed. But I think it's because there's only four players. >> Mhm. Okay. And how do you use AI in writing strategy these days? >> I think it probably replaces what I used to do a lot of on it's much more efficient Googling like so I really um the most gratifying articles I write is</p>
<p>when I write about a topic that I usually don't and then someone from that industry is like wow I did that's that was good cuz you're always working >> you have this imposter syndrome. Oh, I mean fortunately I don't really have imposter syndrome but like if you all work what's the uh what's the mechanism where you're reading something about your air yeah that's right it's like this is totally wrong and then you trust everything else uh I am yeah I don't want to trigger gum's uh amnesia amongst anyone so</p>
<p>>> I will and people ask me like I hate the book question like what books do you read >> I read a lot of books but they're very targeted like I will I'm a very very fast reader so sometimes I'll write an article I know there's a pertinent book and I will just read the whole book in the morning and like really context in there. >> Um >> and but but in general I really want to make sure I fully understand a space it's new that I'm writing about. This is partly though why I have a big competitive advantage. >> I've been thinking about tech since I was in junior high school and I've been writing about tech for 13 years. Yes.</p>
<p>>> So I've already done so much preparatory work that anyone starting from scratch it's like uh it's hard but something so I want to dive into it. I'm one of the world's greatest Googlers. I'd like to think I know every sort of parameter and how to find and it and so I think I can say pretty authoritarily Google has gotten worse. And I don't think it's Google's fault. I just think they just it's harder. One thing is Google's fault is they got so biased towards recency >> and so you have to be super like diligent. But um AI is so incredible for this like just sort of getting</p>
<p>background making sure you understand an issue the ins and outs of it um how things work. you can query stuff, dive deeper. So that is by far my number one use case. I do not always but I will sometimes ask it to this is where I like chatbt like I type in BBedit as an integration. This is also I I'm very annoyed by and am very sensitive to the coin nature. >> Oh this is really great. No, that's not what I'm asking for. I want you to actually go in and find stuff. uh so I do not use it to actually generate any</p>
<p>any exact content but >> okay so targeted research and then critique >> yes >> those would be the the two biggest use cases um you've written a lot about the TSMC break this idea that the limiting factor on all AI expansion is basically</p>
<p><strong>[66:19]</strong></p>
<p>the rate of TSMC capacity expansion because all most AI all AI chips are fabbed at uh at TSMC. It seems like as you look at the AI space and everything interesting going on, uh so you know for mostly chip constrainted right now, which would not have to be the case, you could be power constrainted and stuff, but if you're um uh chip constrained, uh there's a population of people who want to expand very quickly, the AI labs, Nvidia, people like that. And then yeah, famously, which uh you know TSMC, which</p>
<p>is more conservative in how it expands. Why is that? Like why why does the market signal not cause them to build out fab capacity faster? >> Because the risks for fabs are basically larger than for anyone else. You're you're spending billions and billions of dollars on a fab that if it's not fully utilized, if you end up with too much capacity, number one, those all those all your costs are locked in. Like basically 99.9% of the cost for a fab is depreciation, which you're paying the</p>
<p>depreciation. No m like you already showed you're paid in cash flow obviously but it's on your accounting statement no matter what. >> Uh so the fabs can be extremely profitable. TSMC's margins are higher than ever but they can very quickly tip over into having a huge problem. And then once it's already built these fabs can run for a long time. So that excess capacity is depresses prices for years to go. I mean we see this in memory all the time. memory famously goes through these cycles like what's going to happen we're</p>
<p>going to believe it or not we are going to have too much memory capacity in a few years because we have such a shortage right now like Micron just announced like uh there a huge new fab in Singapore like right and everyone's going to do that and which is and so but why has this happened to memory >> there's three competitors in memory if Micron doesn't do it SKH will if SKX doesn't do it Samsung will and so you have a dynamic where a healthy dynamic which is the fabs know better but they can't help themselves and so they take</p>
<p>on the risk and they build these fabs. The problem we have with logic is that TSMC doesn't have that pressure and so they're actually behaving rationally. TSMC is giving up potential long-term revenue. Yeah. >> But the downside for a fab in particular is so large that they don't want to realize that downside. Can they not pass the risk on to the customer where it's like you are going to pay for the entire fab? >> That's probably what they need to get to. And so Apple famously uh did a lot</p>
<p>of this uh sort of prepaid and particularly when TSM was sort of expanding hugely in the 2010s and they maybe need to get even more explicit about that. But I think the better solution and the cheaper solution for the hyperscalers in the long run would</p>
<p><strong>[69:19]</strong></p>
<p>be to do what is necessary for TSMC to get better. Then you get it for free. Yeah, >> you don't need to prepay it. So there's this risk that's out there this risk of overbuilding. >> Right now TSMC is shifting all that risk to the hyperscalers to Nvidia to Apple. And the way it m and the reason why they get away with it is because the risk is foregone revenue. >> Yeah. >> It's money you don't make. And worse than that, it's money you don't make four or five years down the road. And everyone like what does every company say on their earnings right now? We</p>
<p>could have made more but we don't have enough supply. Y >> and if you think it's bad and why is it bad right now? Chat GPT comes out. Every hyperscaler starts investing like crazy. What does TSMC do? They actually decreased their capex year-over-year. two years in a row >> they did they there was no market response from TSMC to the chat GPT moment now they increased to 41 last year they're going up to like 60 this year but even that increase to 60 is a less percentage increase than than last year I think we're looking at a massive short shortness in chips in 2029 uh or</p>
<p>or so and particularly as the other thing the compute density of AI is so much larger right if you have an agent outdoing stuff it's doing so many more computations in a limited amount of time than me and my googling is even humanly possible to do and all these lookups. So we have a CPU shortage too and Intel Intel >> shut down some of their CPU plants, right? Uh so it's it the whole semiconductor the uh I just think it's a it's it's a</p>
<p>big problem and we're shifting to for a long time like how can we get an alternative to TSMC for geopolitical reasons >> and the truth is it's kind of like the bundling thing. It's really hard to get companies to buy insurance particularly when the insurance is uh number one you have uh like everyone else wants someone else to do it right who's going to be the one to go go and make the sacrifice but also it might not happen China might not attack Taiwan >> and also >> as long as it doesn't happen it's super suboptimal to go somewhere else cuz TSMC</p>
<p>is better right >> and their customer it's not just their their fab's better their customer service is better and they have all the IP blocks you need and they've done this before and you have existing relationship and they'll punish you cuz they women, they have control because they like they're they're not going to fulfill all their orders right now because there's so much demand and so they can pick and choose sort of who and so people are scared. They don't want to go anywhere else. Uh and and the uh so uh how are we going to solve this problem? And I think I actually wrote on the front page of Shery about this this</p>
<p>week even which is basically the same thing I wrote in update but this was a like >> this someone needs to wait. Yeah. Someone needs to the hyperscalers in particular need to appreciate I think a massive crunch is coming >> and it's now on them to get Intel up to speed to get Samsung up to speed to get a credible alternative. Yes, in theory you could pay >> for political geopolitical reasons or</p>
<p><strong>[72:21]</strong></p>
<p>for shortages. >> No, we'll get the geopolitical reasons for free. Okay. I think there's massive economic reasons to do so, >> which is all the revenue you're going to be forgoing in 2029 if you don't do it now >> and then we'll happily get geopolitical uh insurance for free. >> But if TSMC are the best, like isn't rather than like stand up Intel, which seems hard, isn't the answer to just again prepay for an extra fab build out for >> this is like how do we feel in tech about ongoing operational costs as opposed to putting in some money up front and fixing the problem permanently? the the market structure is a problem. You're dealing with a</p>
<p>monopolist >> and like not a like a mean monopolist. >> They're very nice, right? And they actually have not arguably not raised prices nearly as much as they should have, right? But the the reality is there's this market structure problem that is going to impact the hyperscalers and it behooves them I think to fix the structure otherwise the costs of ensuring they or overcoming that are just going to be be larger and larger. >> This seems like the topic you have felt strongest about in the past year or two.</p>
<p>>> I felt pretty strong with Apple Vision Pro. >> Okay, fair. What was your take with Apple Vision Pro? >> They finally showed an NBA game and they kept changing cameras. They're applying 2D television production techniques to an immersive technology. Just let me say courtside. >> I know the TSMC break seems like a bigger deal. Um >> Oh, probably. >> I have some rapid fire questions or I'm not going to say rapid fire necessarily, but um uh more uh a collection of disconnected uh questions for you. >> I'll connect them. That's that's what I >> Great. Um how should schools do homework</p>
<p>now that AI exists? I think they should incorporate it and they should probably do in-person exams like uh or in like the >> Yeah, I mean you you it's silly to try to crush it out. I'm very opposed to these like AI detectors which don't work is more I mean probably I'm particularly sensitive to it because obviously a lot of my pros is in these models. Um no one like my thing was I wasn't an MD user but um I'm a world's biggest semicolon</p>
<p>user. Yeah. >> Uh, which >> I was a big M user all. >> Oh, unfortunately the models don't seem to have really incorporated the the semicolon mayo. I haven't been that influential, but um but yeah, no, you you want kids to use it >> cuz whoever can use AI most effectively in their jobs going forward is going to have a big advantage. >> Um, so there's probably some return to, >> you know, more in-class being more important. I think the this my this is my view on content generally. This is I I just uh I think there's a world in which not all content but some content</p>
<p>is more valuable than ever because AI is a perfectly individualized experience. What you read is not necessarily what I read. So stuff that we both read >> is actually compelling and I'm very interested in >> figure out how to leverage that to be sort of beneficial to people in the long run. And what can you get from school that you can't get elsewhere, right? like I can read the notes, I can read</p>
<p><strong>[75:23]</strong></p>
<p>XYZ, but there's being in class having a discussion about it, like actually interacting, being pushed on these sorts of things. All this is a sort of a beautiful theoretical depiction of what school might be that is probably very far removed from the reality. But identifying things that are common experiences are going to be more and more valuable. Yeah. >> Common content, common classroom time, live events, like shared experiences because anything that's individualized is just going to be completely swalled.</p>
<p>>> Yes. Do sports teams become >> more valuable than an AI abundance. >> Everything live becomes more valuable. >> That's something I'm thinking a lot about as far as my business, right? Like the >> there's some aspect of tens of thousands of people reading the same thing every day. Yes. That is actually really powerful. There's something interesting there. the possibility of doing live events where people can come together. Uh you I think a lot about community. I think no one's ever really solved community around content like a message board or comments or not. You have to get very bad dynamics. There's a few</p>
<p>people that dominate it. >> Totally. >> Uh but what is great is >> if we're in a group chat and you share an interesting article and you have a discussion about that. Yes. >> Uh so there there's a lot of stuff around that I think is really interesting and that I'm thinking a lot about. >> What do you think of what's going on in crypto these days? >> What's crypto? No. Uh, I've always been a crypto defender. Like, uh, just because digital scarcity is fundamentally interesting, >> it's probably even more interesting to this point in a world of infinite content, which you thought we had infinite content before. Now we have infinite content on steroids. >> Uh, not just a six billion humans typing</p>
<p>away, but agents generating stuff sort of constantly. >> And in that world, I think crypto as an identifier of authenticity is going to be more and more important. Like the at the end of the day, I want the original. I don't want a reproduction. >> And I'm optimistic about humans ability to create value where it seemed impossible it would ever exist. I'm literally a professional like podcaster and content</p>
<p>creator and get paid a lot of money to do it. Uh imagine explaining that to someone on the farm worried about the the automation. Speaking of that, you mentioned that a majority of strate uh consumption is now in the audio form rather than the written form. >> As far as I can tell, I don't do like but the more than well more than half my subscribers are subscribed to >> I consume the audio form. Yeah, it's quite interesting. I added the pod this is actually where I started building my own software. I was begging everyone to support paid podcasts. There was</p>
<p>dedicated paid podcasts and there was like writing ones and no one would do it. So, of course, I had to just hire engineers and build it myself, at which point it obviously was the right thing to do. Now, everyone does it. Um, whatever. That's my fate in life, I guess. But the uh Yeah, people love it. Like, the interesting thing is I'm not sure it's been good for my business. >> Why? >> Oh, cuz people >> The good news is is I think it drives</p>
<p><strong>[78:25]</strong></p>
<p>retention cuz people would build up emails cuz it's like it feels like a lot of work >> and they say, "I haven't read this in ages. I unsubscribe." Whereas it they just consume seven minutes or eight minutes. The problem is they don't share. Yeah. Audio content is not shared. >> Totally. I listen to it in the car on the way home from work and uh that's great. And then I >> never think about it ever again. >> Exactly. >> But it's great for me because I can write the same I can say the same thing the next day. You're like, "Oh, that was a very insightful comment. You even know I said it yesterday." >> Yeah. We if we reason about what sectors are going to be important down the road, you know, for the AI buildout, energy is</p>
<p>um is going to be a big a big deal and the ability to actually power the data centers that are coming online. Uh that may be a bigger constraint going forward than even chips. Uh robotics are clearly going to be a big thing. It seems like China is doing better on energy and better on robotics and is catching up on chips, doing okay on, you know, the AI models. But does that mean China's potentially very well positioned for the coming wave of tech trends? >> I mean, I think any country that is</p>
<p>capable of actually building things is well positioned. But then again, the counterargument uh if I could sort of put a silver lining on it is the challenge, the trick going forward and to sort of defy the doomers as it were is actually creating new sorts of value, new sources of value in a way that humans are uniquely capable of. And that is by definition a sort of an innovation story. It's a freeing up resources from things that can be done by machines</p>
<p>>> to more productive. It's it's having a consumer market that pulls out that sort of innovation that makes it possible to write a newsletter or a podcast and actually pay for it. >> And so there is a scenario where China is well positioned to win the total commodification of everything which doesn't have much margin. >> Mhm. and the actual value creation and what makes humans humans and</p>
<p>generates the value that I think people in AI are skeptical can be created >> despite the fact 90% of us use working agriculture and like 1% do uh for some reason that's not going to repeat uh >> if you want to be optimistic that's the sort of thing that America has always done well >> what's your stripe feedback for us >> oh where to start Uh, I mean I am obviously it's hard for me to write about Stripe because I'm not biased because I was very early. I think you</p>
<p>you introduced the billing API in 2011 which is a direct spur for wanting to do thinking this was a business model that was possible. So very very big thumbs up on that. >> The you didn't warn me about this. I should have thought about this. Uh actually you do have you have one huge issue that I was just dealing with. Oh yeah. a >> your a implementation is a is someone</p>
<p><strong>[81:26]</strong></p>
<p>can go in and if I try to add on to an a plan so we'll say I have a team cuz that's where you use a like large companies and they want to add someone on >> if that add-on fails the entire plan gets canceled >> so we have to build a bunch of logic to handle that independently >> okay so >> so that's a very detailed specific problem that we're facing >> buggy a subscription interactions okay that's a good one >> uh there's there's definitely more I'd have to go back and think about it. But I mean, I do think the, you know, we didn't talk about stable coins in this sort of area of of I've always been a</p>
<p>big skeptic of like microtransactions >> because the problem it goes to the investigative reporting thing. You can't build something sustainable if you're only monetizing in the back end. >> And the only way to do that is to have a very large market, which this is what YouTube is. YouTube is a bunch of speculative video makers hoping that they'll get enough views that the ads will pay for it. and they're such a large scale and they monetize their ads so effectively that it works. There's no market like this for written content or like podcast content and you can't people are like oh pay for one article</p>
<p>like no what you're paying for when you >> when you pay for me is you're paying for my ongoing production. I'm making a promise to you I'm going to write something every day and you're paying for that promise. You're not paying for the actual content. The content is is a byproduct of that. The question for AI and microtransaction is you have all these labs paying people all over the world to generate data and like you know if you're like a radiologist you get paid $300 an hour. I saw an article about it and all these sliding scales</p>
<p>>> and they're all duplicating work. This is because they're all you know everyone feels a sense I can get differentiation. What we clearly need is some sort of market mechanism for data generation that in the long run will replace what we're getting from journalistic enterprises which are even more doomed than ever before. So how do you generate uh like you're paying directly for content and then AIs can get it and can you can build a large market like YouTube >> that people will speculatively do it</p>
<p>trusting that they'll get paid because the market is large enough. That's what needs to happen. Like a lot of things, there's this massive valley of how do we get from here to there? Um, but we'll see. I know Cloudflare is trying to push on that. So, we'll see what happens. >> Yeah. Last question. How would you rate the execution of the major tech companies >> like the big five? >> Yeah, sure. >> Uh, Apple traditionally very strong. Their manufacturing remains amazing. Like the iPhone Air that just the alarm went off and make sure I turned the snooze off.</p>
<p>Uh, the greatest smartphone ever made. >> Really? >> Oh, yeah. >> I never even seen one. >> Oh. >> Oh, it's it's thin. Is the battery life good? >> Good enough. >> Yeah. Like it's bad. >> What's that? >> It sounds like it's bad then. >> No, it's fine. I mean, I actually forgot my external battery and it's doing okay now. And I'm back in Wisconsin. I have to wear jeans cuz it's cold and it slides right in. Uh, it's f actually I love it. Okay. >> I'm very devastated to hear they might not make it regularly.</p>
<p><strong>[84:27]</strong></p>
<p>>> Uh, >> obviously Apple's Apple's software has gotten pretty rough. their relationship with devel I mean the Apple is so interesting because the reality is when it comes to platforms you have to build the price of becoming a platform is making a great product so Apple gets platforms so they make great products and they're terrible stewards of the platforms Microsoft is a great platform steward but they can't make good products so they never get the permission to sort of have big platforms uh which is sort of a tragedy there um >> but Apple it's some you know it's an old company driven managers, not founders.</p>
<p>And maybe they, you know, the AI Siri got as bad as it was is obviously really bad. But at the end of the day, we still need devices. They're still better at them than anybody else. So, they'll probably be okay. Um, Google, I've had the hardest time understanding Google in part because I think Google does a lot of stuff suboptimally. almost everything I feel like they do suboptimally, >> but I think that lack of like Apple can be super optimist,</p>
<p>>> but I think it's their lack of optimization that actually makes them maybe the most resilient of all the tech companies because they never they never get so exactly doing what they should do and they have all this extra fluff and doing things and gazillion science projects, but because their their their core business model is so good, it throws off so much cash, they can just sort of be sort of >> Yeah. Yeah. >> very flexible. And I've come to appreciate that about them. Everything that frustrates me and analyzing them</p>
<p>actually has this hidden benefit of resiliency and strength and adaptability. >> And you know, they're like the the the amorph what's this? what's the the slime that just will like and if they're coming in your direction like you're actually in big it might take them >> a really long time to get there but when they get there you're doomed. Um, so Microsoft, Microsoft is always I've gotten a lot of mileage right about Microsoft. Everyone is especially in the SAS era. All these companies are like, "Oh, the Microsoft sucks. We're going to</p>
<p>make the best of breed product." >> And guess what? Uh, startups in Silicon Valley, they want to buy all the best of breed products and they have the capabilities to send them together. >> Joe in managing the tire shop doesn't care about he just wants this crap to work and to work together. And if it's all mediocre, but it kind of works together, that's better than best of breed. And right just just squashing these companies would grow and just hit the hit that Microsoft wall again and again. Is that going to persist in an AI world? It's probably tied to the SAS</p>
<p>question sort of before in some respects. >> They their distribution and and power there, you know, remain sort of substantial. >> Meta's probably in my experience >> been the best execute. There's I mean you usually see stuff like interacting with PR or executives like they just run such a tight yeah that that's always been very impressive to me. I think the</p>
<p><strong>[87:29]</strong></p>
<p>again I think their ad model is underrated. The trick with them is keeping engagement like that that's what makes the whole thing go. They've done a decent job of that. hours spent in chat GPT hours not spent on Instagram or not spent and I think that that's an underrated area and I think they're kind of betting that look that's all fine and well today but in the long run this is an infrastructure game we have cash flow to fund it and >> open AI doesn't I think open might be a bigger threat to Facebook than Google</p>
<p>something worth considering >> but uh Facebook is obviously clearly spending to to meet it so now Amazon Amazon. There's a lot of there's a lot of fab capacity and power being spent on tranium that um one wonders could be better spent on on other chips. But we'll see what happens. >> Aren't people happy with the trinium chips? >> The degree to which Amazon optimized uh cloud computing I think is underappreciated when you're operating in a commodity</p>
<p>market. So there's two ways to succeed, right? You could have a differentiated product where you can charge a high margin >> or you can have a lower cost structure in a commodity market where the the price floor is the market price but your cost structure is lower than your competitors. So that's where you make your margin. That was how Microsoft that was how Amazon dominated the cloud. They their their their cloud was way more optimized than anyone else's. The whole Nitro architecture like just the way they architected everything doing a lot of their own chips shifting to Graviton. I think the thing with graviton their</p>
<p>sort of their ARM CPU is they could who's the number one customer for graviton Amazon itself and so they can move all their loads to that optimize it build all the software libraries and then start offering it on a cost basis to others that's the playbook that they're trying to run with trrenium where the number one customer trrenium in the long run is Amazon but then they develop all the capabilities around it for other people for it to be attracted to other people at lower prices and they they have that structurally smaller cost structure. The problem is</p>
<p>that works when you sort of leveled off in performance, right? Amazon executed this model between 2005 and 2025. Of course, processors got faster in that time, but not it wasn't like the 80s or 90s when every leap was massive. >> Does that does that work in a relatively new market when there's massive leaps to be made generation on generation and they have Nvidia servers? Do they have as many as they could? >> Yeah.</p>
<p>>> Uh because they're on this strategy. Um I see >> probably not. >> Ben, thank you. >> Thank you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ramp founder Eric Glyman on the many ways AI is changing corporate spending</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRPCRIhrYac</link>
      <description>Eric Glyman is the cofounder and CEO of Ramp, the finance automation platform that now powers over 2% of all corporate spend in the US. He sits down with John and co-host Alex Rampell to discuss how Ramp scaled to over $1 billion in revenue in just seven years, and why the future of fintech is "selling time, not money." They cover the "SaaS apocalypse" (and why lines of code are becoming a liability), how Ramp uses AI agents to review 100,000 expenses a day with 99% accuracy, and why their internal data suggests the US economy is much stronger than the Census Bureau reports.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>I don't know if we need,
if we want to do this, but— I already look like that naturally, so. Oh, this is Kevin from "The Office." Yeah, yeah. Eric Glyman is the
co-founder and CEO of Ramp, the corporate card and
finance automation platform. Founded in 2019, Ramp has
taken the industry by storm. Oh, cheers. Cheers. Can you describe maybe a good framing, just the Ramp business today? What's the biggest part of the business in terms of where you make money? What are the new growth lines? Any metrics you can share on the scale? Alex and I have a million questions, but maybe you can start by
just framing it up for us.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course. So first, just the pace
that this has come together has been pretty remarkable. Seven years, yeah. You know? I think by the time we
were, six years and change, the company had passed over
a billion a year in revenue. The largest portion of that is card. And so, that might be a classic kind of interchange-based model. But behind it— So this is people, in their business they have spend cards, everyone walking around the
company has a Ramp card. And you run interchange on those.</p>
<p>That's right. Next, you can think about
bill payments and software. Software, it's a two-something-year-old business line, just about two years and some months. That's over 100 million a year business line in and of itself. And that can be advanced
functionality to maybe manage lots of entities, to automate
aspects of accounting, maybe aspects of
procurement, bill payments. So this can be sending checks, wires, ACH and that's predominantly a float</p>
<p>as well in some cases foreign
exchange transaction business. Treasury. That's a product that is about a year old, several billion dollars of deposits. Some of that is checking-like products. Some of that is more of an investment and money ladder type product. And then the last, the
other ones are procurement and then travel, which
is a bit of an in-kind. And what's been so interesting
is that if you break down and look towards maybe let's
say contribution profit, gross profit of the business, a few years ago it would've been</p>
<p>90 plus percent card. I think by the end of
this year, the second, third, fourth, fifth lines of business will comprise and aggregate the majority of Ramp's business. And so, it's evolved into
this platform by which if you're trying to operate your company, it's just a lot more efficient. You spend less. I think
people know Ramp for, we help the average
company cut their expenses by about 5% per year. The thing that's been really fascinating</p>
<p>is people are starting to use
these products in aggregate. Not only are they not paying for five, six sets of point solutions, but they're also not wasting time. They're growing faster. The average customer last year on Ramp grew their revenue by, I think it was 16%, which compared to, in the United States, the average business— Much higher than that.</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it's 5% in the US. And so, in some sense
what we're trying to do is be not just a better platform, but a better, almost kind of
digital brain for organizations to allocate resources and
make sure spend is not wasted. Yeah. So, you start by selling, say, spend cards into a business. The CFO likes it, the employees like it, and then that gives you
permission to go sell some of this other functionality. And so it's kind of a classic
multi-product cross sell. Is it always starting with spend cards</p>
<p>or do you now have multiple front doors into the business? It's been the big story of the past year. I think there were, over the last quarter, thousands of businesses that
came in just for bill payments. There's accounting firms
that are becoming into, they say, "We're a Ramp shop here if you want to work with us. We'll bring in bill payments, treasury..." We use Ramp to go power that and they can manage 10, 100, 200 clients all through one platform.</p>
<p>And we're excited. I mean, probably the fastest growing line of business is procurement. Or, they're single
clients that are looking to kind of bring in and do full-scale purchase orders across, whether it's single or a dozen plus entities,
all the way through. And so, that's been the really fun story of the past year. Do you have a view on
what the right policy is for employee spend within a business? I love that you ask this, yeah. 37signals or someone will say, "Companies are so lame.</p>
<p>you just give everyone a credit card and trust people and it's fine." And then meanwhile,
large companies are like, "Well, this hotel is in a Tier 2 city and therefore there's this dollar limit and it must be booked 14 days in advance." And so, you see companies
operate at really two ends of the spectrum in terms of how much flexibility they give people. What is correct for a company,
or does it just vary by size? I love this question. And the interesting part,
if you really kind of dig into Ramp's businesses we have ways of back testing and actually understanding</p>
<p>based on how strict your policy is, how things are running. Does that have an impact on how much time your employees are,
let's say doing expenses, how quickly you're growing. And you can start to actually compare based off of the operating
hygiene of the company… What are end margins? What is a pace of growth
that occurs at the company? And I bring this back to what— So you can do a correlational study between expense policies and company growth.</p>
<p>Yeah. And look, it's pretty interesting. I mean, the first, there's an aspect of, in most companies, particularly
high growth companies, it tends to resemble something closer to the "no rules rules" Netflix approach of we're going to trust but
verify and shine a light on it. Spend tends to be reasonably permissive. But then part of the
breakthrough of the past year</p>
<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>
<p>is you could basically
take an expense policy, let's say it's written in plain English. "If the flight is more than five hours, you can take business. If it's under..." Things that
would've been horrible to go and have your managers
go and verify this stuff, now you can run that through an LLM. I think that we're processing
over 100,000 expenses a day that are being reviewed agentically. This is a very fast-growing
subset of the business. So you give the Ramp agent this company's expense
policy and then it applies it</p>
<p>to the transactions
that are coming through. Exactly. And so you can start to do things like, I think about the episode
you'd had with Susan Li. It was incredibly instructive where, she sort of says, it would feel so silly and it's not a great use
of my time in some sense to be a very expensive machine
learning algorithm to do, to review expenses. But yet somehow a lot
of people in companies are reduced to that
thanks to Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules around it. Now you can have an agent
functionally that does that, that takes that aspect of the job.</p>
<p>And so, it has access
to the full set of data that you would, all the
transaction-related metadata, the receipt data, the timing
data, the policy data. It then can go in real-time review. Was this in or out? Can have the full audit trail
explaining its reasoning. And today it's over 99% accurate, which turns out it's much
more accurate than people are. So people don't know the expense policy and expenses are pretty automated. And I find this thing
super interesting, in part because I don't think it
should be anyone's job</p>
<p>to go and review people's expenses, but somehow, while it's in no one's JD, the law kind of requires
everyone to waste an hour of their time every month,
if you're a manager. And does the law allow for
it to be reviewed agentically and then just signed off on by the human? It does, yeah. The goal of this is separation of duties. That you yourself are not reviewing your own expenses. There needs to be a set of procedures that govern and actually are effective
through the action of, okay, the rule says this.</p>
<p>Did you take some steps to do this? It can be a system— Yeah, you can't self-certify. The funny thing is that, I
mean, one way of doing this… Actually, we used to do this is why not just post your expense reports in the public eye, right? So, and the reason to do this
is actually it could go wrong. You could say, "I'm going to spend... You stay at the Four Seasons, I'm going stay at the Five Seasons." You could go that direction. But what you actually
want is a moral code. It's like, if you were the owner of the business it is your own money.
Yes. So if you were staying
at the Five Seasons, I've just made that hotel chain up, it's like, you're—</p>
<p>Sounds pretty nice. You're stealing from yourself,
why would you do that? The problem is that once you get to tens of thousands of people, how do you impose that moral code? And actually like the two tent poles that you just
mentioned, they're both bad. Because if you have to
stay at a crappy hotel and you're about to sign a
two million dollar contract and you didn't get any
sleep. It's the Motel 6 and you take a two-hour taxi, it's like, all right, you
saved the company money.</p>
<p><strong>[09:03]</strong></p>
<p>That does not make sense. Stay at the Four Seasons. But you can't really embody that in, "if this, then that." Because what you want is this moral code. Like that's what you want. And like how do you actually instill that? And there's almost a
behavioral psychology way, which is like, we'll just show what people are spending. If you're at the top of the leaderboard, we might trust but verify
and verify a lot more. But that's the hard thing to do and actually preserve
as the company goes from the founder, to the founder
plus the founder's brother to many, many more people. How do you keep that same esprit de corps or this informal code.</p>
<p>I think it comes back to… What was the name of the movie? "12 Angry Men," I think it was where, as you're watching the film, you get some level of detail and someone seems very guilty. It's a dead shut case. And as more evidence emerges, you realize actually,
this may be different. And you need more context in order to arrive at
maybe a moral conclusion. Did it relate to closing a project? How does it relate to an outcome</p>
<p>that maybe you'll see
emerge one month, two months after you stayed at the Five Seasons and closed the deal that
changed the company, whatever the example is. I would argue in favor of tools that have more context,
that do more jobs of work. Because not only can you
do the narrow job better, but you can start to get at the answer of what actually is
right for shareholders. Where should we be allocating capital? It's so interesting to hear because every company
approaches this differently. Like I'm on the board of Wise</p>
<p>and you know, Kristo
flies coach everywhere, everybody flies, that's just the policy but it might be penny-wise, pound-foolish. Again, not for me to say, but I also really admire
the corporate code. It's just like you,
actually, that is cultural. It's kind of weird to say expenses are
cultural, but they are. For sure. Yeah, it's shared— Shared belief system. It's a shared belief system. It's like, what is the
culture of the company? You talked about your
expansion into Bill Pay. It seems like bill payment</p>
<p>has proven, over the past 40 years, uniquely resistant to
automation and modernization. If you look at how a typical business pays their rent or if you
order a keg of Guinness, you'll get a PDF emailed to you by some person who has
a relationship with you and there will be bank account details which hopefully are correct. And you send a payment to those. And even bill payment products, you guys have a bunch of technology here,</p>
<p>but it's like, we scan the
PDF in an automated way or we ensure that the bank account details weren't mistyped or something. But it's kind of "putting
a little bit of lipstick on the pig" of the whole system being super antiquated. Why is the system so antiquated when it comes to bill
payment in particular? I think this is some of
what Alex was bringing up.</p>
<p><strong>[12:05]</strong></p>
<p>It's the constraints of programming things in an "if this, then that"
kind of world are very heavy. There's a lot of complexity. And when you think about the nuance and algorithms that govern why do companies spend money
under some circumstances, how hard it can be to record. I wouldn't overlook... Let's say that you're a manufacturer and you're buying some asset
which you're going to use for five years and it's
going to depreciate. It's a very different accounting treatment versus I'm buying a
pay-as-you-go SaaS app.</p>
<p>All the complexities around that might govern whether or
not you decide to spend. And then finally, once
you get all this detail, how do you review this and decide where to allocate
your next marginal dollar is very complicated. But many systems are in place upgraded despite the fact that
that's pretty complex. So credit cards started with no real-time authorization system, which is crazy. And you just hoped that
they were good for— Carbon copy. Exactly. The machine
with the pleasing sound.</p>
<p>They'd do great in the
current ASMR environment. That's true. But then they added, you could call up and get an authorization and then they obviously added to the current systems we know where— The modem, you forgot the modem. Exactly. And then the modem. And so, in place credit
cards were upgraded with much better capabilities. And similarly, if you look at checks and how they work, even though we think of
checks as antiquated, it used to be the case
that physical checks had to be flown all around the country to be physically settled. And then there was the Check 21 Act in, what was it, the year 2000?</p>
<p>Where they said a scan
of a check is good enough and so they could be
digitized by the banks and then shredded. And then there was the, you can take a photo of
a check with your phone. And so we've managed to take this super old-timey check system and despite the fact it's super old-timey, in some ways it has actually
been meaningfully upgraded. And if you looked at the bill
pay system from the outside, you would say we should
have DNS for companies. So rather than a company like sending you their
bank account details, you should look them up in
some central clearinghouse. And that way you confirm that
you're not being phished. A lot of spear-phishing
attacks work that way.</p>
<p>Although you referenced this. So there's actually an indifference point that you can graph. If interest rates go up high enough, if I send you a check, which is like a paper mail check and that takes five days and hopefully the USPS goes on strike for two more weeks so
I've got the postmark. I actually benefit… It's
actually cheaper for me. You legally paid, right? It's crazy. No, it's crazy. This is the problem. Like credit cards, everybody... I am in the store, I want the TV. You want to sell me the TV. We both want this done right away. And in the knuckle-crunching, ASMR,</p>
<p>carbon-copy days, they might not have been
willing to sell that to me because they didn't know if
I was good for the money. They'd never seen me before. And the interesting thing is that AR and AP are almost
an adversarial process. You mentioned this. What do you want to do as a controller? Well, you want to pay as late as possible and you want to collect
as early as possible. And then you have this
weird thing where checks, it's not just an accident</p>
<p><strong>[15:06]</strong></p>
<p>that they stick around for a long time. It's like there's a financial
incentive for one party. So that's true on payment
timing, I agree with that but there are some things that
are just a dead weight loss, like the ability to fat-finger a bank account. No one benefits from that. Everyone has a horrible time if that happens.
No, that Nigerian guy. There's some people that benefit. Nigerian princes. Let's think of everyone. I will posit that many networks have been upgraded in place. But somehow the loose
network of businesses paying each other via PDF invoices has proven very resistant
to in-place upgrades.</p>
<p>Also, I love your notion of DNS for payments or for expenses. So, I don't know if you saw this, Google wanted to issue a 100-year bond. Yes. So, why is that interesting? Imagine that I am owed money by Google. I am one of the small
businesses that you reference. Their job is to pay me
as late as possible. Yes. They can borrow money for a hundred years at like 3% or whatever it is, cheaper than the US government probably. T plus a hundred, yeah. I mean it's a little more expensive than the US government,
but they are borrowing...</p>
<p>That's crazy. I can borrow money at 20%, but why do I need to borrow money? Because Google's paying me late. Those jerks. So, I should be able to borrow money kind of at the rate at which
Google is borrowing money because my AR... My AR is their AP. But the problem is, unless
you put all this together, you would just look at me and you're like, "Well, you're just a little schmuck. I'm going to charge you 18%." It's like, yeah, but it's Google. They could borrow money at T plus</p>
<p>whatever, you know, SOFR plus a hundred. 100%. That's not fair. But the only way to really solve that is with more data and
actually entangling... Not entangling, but just kind of connecting these things together. For sure. What's your vision for once AI is doing a lot
of software engineering, what does that look like in
three or four years time? Is the competitive equilibrium similar, but the expectations for the amount of software and
functionality businesses are shipping is much higher? Are software teams similar
looking, different looking?</p>
<p>Again, you're doing a
lot of AI engineering. What does the future hold? It's all blurring. It's totally crazy. There's a designer shipping code. Marketing at Ramp reports into our CTO Karim, my co-founder who's doing some of
like the best marketing I've ever experienced and seen. We have customer support agents like shipping code to production too. I just think that the
half-life of you see a problem to how long it takes for you to go fix it</p>
<p>and do something about it
is shrinking immensely. Or if you want to change
a color of a button, you can just say, "Hey at Ramp Inspect, can you change the color of this button?" And it goes and spins it up and it does it within minutes. It verifies and validates it. And so, I actually think in some sense,</p>
<p><strong>[18:07]</strong></p>
<p>these classic barriers that software businesses had are clearly going to erode. Yes but, there's the old joke of "It's much more fun to
write code than read code," which explains a lot of
software engineer's behavior. And it becomes easier
to change the button. Is that another instance
of it being more fun to write code than read code? Where lines of code are a
liability and not an asset because they're something you have to reckon with. And so, are companies
at some level incurring some tech debt now where
they're adding a bunch of code, which will maybe be harder
to reason with later?</p>
<p>Or do you just get bailed out by the models getting better? It's really interesting. And by the way, one of
the other interesting sub-conversations I'm hearing a lot, too, is when you think about where
tech debt comes from, there's a set of conditions and trade-offs you make, you write things in a discreet and deterministic way. Under these circumstances,
follow this code path. Under this circumstance,
follow this other one. In a world where there's LLMs and the models
themselves are improving, I think it's entirely
possible that the way</p>
<p>that code is written is you say, "Here's what I'm solving for. Under these kinds of conditions,
here's what I want to occur. Go write the code that
drives this outcome." And maybe with the models
such as they are today can get it done in sort of a spaghetti code written fashion. But it kind of works even
though it's some kind of Rube Goldberg machine underneath the hood. But as these models get much smarter, you might write your code base
in such a way where you say, "Every year, rewrite the underlying code, but here's the outcome I can drive."</p>
<p>And today you accomplish
my outcome 90% of the time, 95, 98, 99, 100. And do you just have kind of self-healing and writing code all the way through? And this notion of like
underlying code does goes away because we're writing things
in this different manner. Obviously, there's real
conditions in which that's not going to… That won't occur. Like, if you're writing
code that needs to have, four nines of accuracy and uptime, like that's probably not
the methods you're using. But if you're like a
growth engineering team, that's probably what you're doing today</p>
<p>if you're kind of on the
leading edge of this stuff. And so, I find this
stuff very fascinating. And when I think about the deeper implications of this stuff, I think that if you are
completing this small amount of cognitive work... Let's say you are an expense app. The spend has occurred, it needs to go get the... Write it down somewhere
and get someone's approval. And that's all the knowledge
work that you're doing. That's very few tokens in
order to accomplish that,</p>
<p>both to create the infrastructure
in order to facilitate it, like that probably evaporates. Anyone can probably custom
write that kind of app. Whereas if you're doing
much deeper kind of work, such to underwrite a company, provide financing, automate
areas of accounting. I think the fitness function for companies</p>
<p><strong>[21:09]</strong></p>
<p>becomes can you actually
do things in such a way where even if you could
spend tokens on it, it would take more tokens
to create the thing or do that work than the
system maybe that you've built to kind of drive that outcome. I just think the rules of what it means to be a software company are changing. I think network effects
and what you're building is more important than ever. Like, if you think about
the classic set of moats that are there, I think
that this question of where are their moats in a world where... I like Dario's way of putting this.</p>
<p>If you have a country of geniuses— Data center, yeah. Living somewhere and they're writing code and they're incentivized
to compete with you, too. If you're not really following what are the classic four moats and building towards that, like, I think life gets a lot harder. Yes. Do you guys have a house view on the new competitive equilibrium with a lot of AI
engineering really working? Well, I think there are a couple things. I think Marc talked about
this a little while ago,</p>
<p>but what is an EPD team? Engineering product design team. Product development team. You normally have one product manager, maybe you have five to eight
engineers and one designer. And now everybody has
Cursor and Claude Code. So the designer is like, "I don't need any of these bozos." The product manager says, "I
don't need any of those bozos." Each of the engineers are like, "I don't need any of these bozos." And they're all— It's like the start of "The Dark Knight." And they're all right. It really is, it's… Exactly. And they're all right. It's like they're all
wearing the Joker mask. Or, the Joker mask</p>
<p>is Claude Code or Cursor. But the problem is, because I
was talking to one of my CEOs, this is a pretty scaled
company, lots of revenue. And they use all these tools, they're not more efficient. And he is like, "Why
aren't we more efficient?" And it's two things. Number one, it's a real company, they have real customers. They can't just push things
and hope for the best. But it's like you actually have an HR problem in that if you're building from scratch, granted you have nothing,
you have no tech debt, you don't really have to
worry about customers, you don't have any,</p>
<p>but you wouldn't have an
eight person EPD team. You would probably just
have each person... We have eight different product managers slash engineers slash whatever. Each one is a pod unto themselves. So that's one thing. I totally agree on the data moats where that has become more important. I'll tell you a story that you might like. I met this company, vLex. It's a 25-year-old company. This guy Alex bought up
every legal record in Spain, like probably going back to 1492. Buys the Ferdinand and Isabella...</p>
<p>Here's the document, I'm going to take a picture of that, I'll sell it to every law firm. And he built like a $20 million a year SaaS business, bootstrapped for 25 years. And then it went to like a
hundred million in one year. Now why is that? Because he used to sell this document or he used to sell a subscription to Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins and all these big law firms. And a paralegal would take that, they would turn it into a document.</p>
<p><strong>[24:10]</strong></p>
<p>They'd charge the client $10,000 and ChatGPT can't do that. GenAI can't do that. But you know who can do that is vLex. Another good example of this, of who has proprietary data? A lot of times, the data's free. This is the really cool thing. Or it's sitting, I wouldn't
call your data free, but it's not like for-sale data sets. Do you know domaintools.com? It's my favorite business. So DomainTools runs a cron job every day on
every single internet website. They do a WHOIS lookup</p>
<p>every single day. And they build a historical record of that which no one has. So if you want to see who
owned stripe.com in 1999, well, it was free in 1999. If you invented time machine,
go run that WHOIS query in your terminal but you can't do that. So you have to pay them. But all that data is free or FlightAware with ADS-B data. So you have a lot of these weird businesses. And of course this is not a new idea, like FactSet, Bloomberg... You have aggregators of data, but that becomes so much more valuable. Totally.</p>
<p>Because your 10,000
geniuses cannot do that. 100%. You always experience this if you hire someone extraordinarily talented, like top of the class at MIT and you say, "All right,
join the engineering team and go ship the code." And they ship something kind of crazy on the first day. And it's sort of slow. And it's like, you can have someone who is intellectually an absolute giant, but learning kind of how
a company does things the way it does. Learning the procedures and nuances</p>
<p>of an organization takes time. It's part of what makes
working with interns or junior engineers fun. I think the learning curve
is obviously immensely steep. And I think that the speed at which, with sufficient access to the data and the procedures of a company, they're going to get
there very, very fast. But these
moats are real, you know? Well, the other moat I would argue is the dark-mattered moat. Yes.
And what I mean is you know, like the Milky Way, nobody could figure out
why the mass is the mass because it's like all the observed stars and planets and everything else.</p>
<p>It's, no, actually the vast
majority of the matter, or energy, because they're the same thing, is dark matter, dark energy. And what does that mean?
Nobody the hell knows. But it's just like, we don't know it. And for products, it's like you built, if I tell Claude, "Go clone Ramp." Because this is the SaaSpocalypse that's happening right now. It's like, oh, of course. Well, I just went to the website and now I have a website
that looks like Ramp. No, no, no. There are like
nine million edge cases. The tech debt sounds bad because it's a pejorative, debt = bad. But actually it's good because what you've
done is you've uncovered</p>
<p>every single problem that can go wrong. The fact that, I mean, a great example, remember when the power
went out in San Francisco a month and a half ago? So we have this amazing
thing called Waymo. Waymo had not figured out this corner case of what if the power goes out? It was a thundering herd
problem with the customer, or the human overrides, yeah. But they had no idea. And it's actually great
that that happened. You need these problems to happen.</p>
<p><strong>[27:11]</strong></p>
<p>For sure. And just because my background, I used to write shareware, this try-before-you-buy software. Shareware was a big thing. That's a blast from the past. It's a blast from the past. So there's a website that's part of CNET— That might come back, you know? Well, but it's freemium. This is where I'm going with this story and you'll like this. So Download.com was the preeminent site for downloading shareware. It was like... CNET was one of the most popular
properties in 1999, 2000. So, all of the top downloadable software products were there— Download.com sounds like a company that had a Super Bowl ad. They would've. I bet they did, actually.
They probably had two.</p>
<p>I'd be shocked. They probably had five. Right between Pets.com and something else. So Download.com had all
the popular products and then this site called Elance shows up and Elance is now called Upwork. This connected you with work
that you would want done by very smart people, basically
in the developing world. So I want a software product built. Here's everybody in Romania
and Russia and India. I want translation, I want graphics. So what ended up happening is people would look at
the Download.com top list because before it was
a very cottage industry</p>
<p>of who wrote shareware and
it was very profitable. Like ID software shareware company, McAfee shareware company. Actually Cybersource started
off processing payments for shareware companies. That's how they got McAfee. That's funny. Very interesting history to this we can talk about some other time, but basically what happened
is people found Elance, like, "Oh, I could pay anybody $500 to clone anything on this list. Everything on this list makes tens of millions of dollars a year. Let's go." And the cloning never worked. It functionally worked.</p>
<p>Because if I say "I'm
going to clone Eric." I might not know that you have a pancreas. Right? I'm sure you do. I might not know that
you have two kidneys. So the problem is that cloning
just, it goes skin deep and like that's the embedded
advantage of these companies. Do you then think the SaaSpocalypse is kind of irrational? I think it depends. I think some of it is very rational. Because if I want, if I have a feature that became a company, and I know this sounds like a very negative thing to say, but I want to get paged if
my server goes down. It's a very logical reason</p>
<p>to build a company called PagerDuty. That now has a lot of stuff around it but I might just say, "Hey,
whenever my servers..." There are corner cases, there is the proverbial the
power goes out in San Francisco, do something differently. That's very, very different than NetSuite, which is, I have a saying that I like, which is the best companies
have hostages, not customers, at least in enterprise software. Not for you because
you actually have INPS. But that they're much
harder to go rip that out and a lot of it is like
the "Goldilocks zone" that you operate in.</p>
<p>If you're too expensive, of course I'm going to
try to rip that thing out. If it's so cheap then I
forgot nobody even used it. So you have to be in this Goldilocks zone, you have to have enough complexity. And ideally the front end is
different than the back end. So, Workday I think is... Nobody's going to get rid of Workday. And I actually credit
David Ricardo with this. Like, comparative advantage. Sure, you could grow your own food.</p>
<p><strong>[30:14]</strong></p>
<p>You could plumb your own plumbing. But you're not going to do that. And somebody could do your own HR system. Yes. The one maybe pitch for Stripe and others that I would say here is, I do think that that is right. And there is a lot of complexity and local tax law for payments and things that make Workday an extraordinary business. There was this overarching
macro question of how does work get done? If you believe that.</p>
<p>You know, work can
get done through tokens and models. And presumably it doesn't go through payroll, probably goes through
a credit card or check to these types of companies. And so, the share of, it's almost this sort of simple math that if you X-rayed the
P&L of most companies, the majority of it classically, at least for asset-light firms, is payroll. You're paying for people to do things and SaaS is maybe a small percentage of a company's income or
a company's cost base.</p>
<p>Does suddenly that share
grow to high single digits, low double digits,
significant double digits? And does the share actually move where, the payroll economy itself, even though maybe it grows,
becomes less relevant? I think this is the
really funny part of even as this has been going on, what do I know as a private company other than seeing our own payment data. But you start to see these companies beating their earnings</p>
<p>in a way they never have before where the terminal value perhaps is falling out. But they're saying, "Shareholders, we're reaccelerating." We haven't seen this since 2021. We're going faster and
you're going to have multiple progressive quarters of this actually occurring for
certain types of businesses. And so, it's a really
interesting time to... I very violently agree with your view is like yeah, it depends. But it's doing really well. That's my brilliant comment, it depends. Yeah, you mentioned... Very Howard Marks of you.</p>
<p>As you're hearing from Eric, Ramp has become the default way a lot of American companies manage spend. Stablecoins allowed that
functionality to work in many countries all at once. With Ramp's stablecoin-backed
corporate cards, businesses can fund a
balance with stablecoins, issue cards against
those balances instantly, and allow employees to spend
anywhere cards are accepted without the business having to think about stablecoins all the time. Same card experience, same controls, just a much more global
set of rails underneath. This is one of the many practical ways</p>
<p>we're seeing businesses
on Stripe use stablecoins by launching card programs
in many more countries and doing so in much less time than it would've taken otherwise. If you're thinking about
using stablecoins to expand, Stripe can help. You mentioned your spend data. What does the spend data that Ramp sees tell us about the economy?</p>
<p><strong>[33:14]</strong></p>
<p>I think it is stronger than many people
understand in lots of ways. I mean first, I'll go
back to one of the things that perplexed our team for a long time. Our economists on the team saw this data even as recently as last year were the Census Bureau would
do these periodic surveys. They'd go out and ask "How much is your business using AI to produce goods or services?" A very refined economic way</p>
<p>of wording the questions. And they would come back with these pronouncements saying a single digit percent
of businesses in the US have adopted AI. And we looked at our data and we support over 55,000 businesses. We lean a little bit towards
tech but not heavily. It kind of resembles the
distribution of businesses you would see in the States. And well, the majority of
businesses have used AI. You look at businesses
whether they're paying for— As in they subscribe
to ChatGPT or Anthropic</p>
<p>or something like that.
Exactly. Or, maybe a business that is a true agentic… Cognition or a Cursor, something like that where this is kind of
vertical application. And so, one, there is
this disconnect between the use of tools if you look at how quickly businesses are adopting and responding to these new tools versus what maybe people
report on. Next: growth. I think it's been clear
over the last few quarters is the US itself is reaccelerating, GDP growth is gone from
maybe the one to 2%,</p>
<p>area to four to five and you could argue how much of this is, a little artificial with subsidies, but it's been pretty significant. But subsidized by what? Some of the Big Beautiful Bill as well as some of the tariffs. And where that's been reallocated, I think some people, I would argue on the whole maybe unfairly said this. I think that there's more durable growth inside of the businesses. But I would say overall business health is much stronger. And I think that the
really interesting thing</p>
<p>and again some of this is
specific to the data that we see, but I think that businesses are generally getting more and more
savvy about finding tools that help them be more efficient. And I think what skews our data is maybe the savings we drive for people. Seems the way of explaining
it is like people know the, Ben Franklin would say this phrase of "a penny saved is a penny earned" and this is awesome aphorism but the average American business has an 8% profit margin. And so mathematically speaking,
a penny saved is equivalent</p>
<p>to 12 pennies of revenue earned. And so, if you save businesses a lot, you end up with these outcomes of the average Ramp bases
materially outgrowing the regular US average. And we can clearly see this and demonstrate this for
our own set of customers. I suspect these types of things are occurring at businesses adopting</p>
<p><strong>[36:15]</strong></p>
<p>these new sets of technologies, I would argue probably faster, very clearly, than what the US is maybe, the classic sources are seeing. So I think it's much healthier. When a business saves money
on Ramp, what happens? The CFO comes in and says, "Oh my god, we're spending— Confetti.
"Way too much money, on confetti. We don't need this much confetti." Who's buying the confetti? "We have huge stockpiles
that we don't need." What happens when a business saves 5%? What are they actually cutting? So there's two pieces of it primarily. One is like these hard-dollar cost savings</p>
<p>and then some of this is time, and I'll start with the time
because it's the squishy one, but I think that it's, in some cases, actually much more important. Oh sure, they save time on
their expense reconciliation. That makes sense. So they're no longer
going through line by line and therefore there's one person who is freed up
to go do something else. Yeah. And I think one of the classic biases that people forget is people chronically undervalue their own time. As a principle of business, everyone has an hourly rate. Within a business, human
time is incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>I think the lean companies got this right and eliminated the bottlenecks there. So, okay, that's one form. What else? Next, all right, when you start to have these fine-tuned kind of controls. This part has been I think probably the biggest lion's share of this. Let's go back to one of
the earlier conversations of why do people use checks, this horrible system and purchase orders. Well, one of the advantages of checks is unless you mail it to
someone and you sign it, no money can leave your company. And what every person knows</p>
<p>who's ever had a credit
card and gone to a gym once and had a good New Year's resolution. But is you go a couple times and you're like, "Goddammit,
this gym is charging me." The difficulty of sending a
check is a feature, not a bug. Yeah, exactly. But it's part of what Ramp was the first to build.
One-time use cards. Single-use cards, but also more than that, merchant blocking. So you can, whether it's on one card or 10,000 cards at once, build in a kill switch to say, "Okay, we've signed this new
deal with this merchant. We are only on Uber,</p>
<p>we are no longer taking Lyfts. And anytime someone goes and
tries to go on merchant A or B, you can do this." Or you sign a new contract and you say, "I'm going spend $10,000
only with Salesforce and on the 10,001th dollar
they try to charge you, it declines." And what gets to happen, you
get to have a conversation with their sales team who really
wants to make their budget. And if you look at this mathematically, for most companies that
come over a low end, maybe a very hygienic company that is giving out a few cards and the old world</p>
<p>could durably cut their expenses about 2% a year by doing this. Some of these very
laissez-faire businesses are saving just 10%, just
through these things. Next, you start ending up
with these more fine-tuned kind of controls where you can say under these circumstances I want to go and have
kind of charges occur. Maybe you have an engineer
stay till 8:00 PM at night,</p>
<p><strong>[39:17]</strong></p>
<p>you can go and buy a meal. But if you take an Uber on a
Saturday, that should turn off. And so you have the cards, if it's like an Uber on
a Saturday auto-decline, but you can text and say
actually it's for work. You send back a yes, it turns on. And so it's all these
little tiny paper cuts that actually start to go into run. Next, it's vendor data. One of the unique assets of Ramp is anytime you spend money,
you upload a receipt, maybe you upload an invoice or an MSA. This takes us back to the Paribus days. We know across hundreds of
millions of purchases every year, not just that you spent
money at a software vendor,</p>
<p>but what did you spend per seat? And so if you're a customer on Ramp and you're about to go
and pay this large bill on a random SaaS vendor, we can show you in real-time before you send the funds, you are paying 20% more
than the rest of the market. Here's kind of the cost curve of what others are paying. And actually by going and
empowering your procurement team— Do you have enough data to do that? Because my AWS bill
is not like your AWS bill. And so, don't you need to know how many instances we're running</p>
<p>to know if this is a good deal or not? You can, but you can still
kind of get down to the level of is there a bulk discount or not? And start to know of, is
there a negotiated aspect? There's other types of
things where I'd argue maybe a lot of classic software- as-a-service ends up in this way. It's like your pricing is
really dependent on, you know, did you sign that deal on January 1st or on December 31st when the sales team really needs to hit the quota. And you can actually see
down to the seat level, you're paying $30 per seat.</p>
<p>It's a great time to be
signing a Salesforce contract. Exactly. And so you can actually get
down to the seat level and say, okay, you're about to auto-renew. The market price has actually
moved for the set of service. And so it can be very, very
useful to procurement teams to know where they
compare with the market. That was actually my question for you, which is, so if you remember Groupon— Yes.
The much beleaguered Groupon, but Groupon started off as a site called ThePoint.com/groupon because originally it was like,</p>
<p>"I don't like the fact that
Starbucks uses paper cups. If I get 10,000 other
people to donate a dollar, we'll fly a plane in front
of Howard Schultz's house," which also emits carbon, a bad example. But you only want, it's a
collective action thing. So, and then because I met Andrew Mason and Brad Keywell when they were first
starting this business, it was like eight people. It was ThePoint and downstairs there was a
pizza restaurant or something like, "Oh, if get like 50 people to agree to buy pizza, maybe
they'll give us a lower price." The cause became discounts.</p>
<p>Yes and then, but then the thing is Groupon wasn't known
for this "it has to tip" because they always had the demand. So they never had to worry about it because before it's
like you've got supply, you've got demand. I guess my question for you is, can you be the arbiter of pricing? Can you aggregate the demand? And the same way that like
Costco, who shops at Costco? Every small restaurant shops at Costco. And Costco uses that
collective bargaining power,</p>
<p><strong>[42:19]</strong></p>
<p>if you will, to say, "Hey Coca-Cola, give us a very, very low price." They take very, very little of that because right now I'm
using Ramp to buy stuff. Yes. But I would imagine if you could say, "Hey, I have $100 billion." I didn't know it was that
high, that's amazing. "I have a hundred
billion dollars of spend. I can hopefully direct
it this way or that way. Please give me a 20% discount." Can you do that? Or is that further in the funnel of the purchase process? There is this large swath of businesses that I've been fascinated by called group purchasing organizations.</p>
<p>A lot of these came out of the healthcare world where it's a very small set of—
APMs, yeah. Yeah, exactly, supplier. But if you can go and aggregate demand, you could say, okay, for
these type of purchases, you're going to offer this procedure at this account for
this type of equipment, you're going to give this
level bulk kind of discount. And you've gone and you've done that and I think these are very popular now in the private equity world. Even when I look at Ramp data today, there are dozens of, and more and more every
year, of merchants where, you know, we were sending
billions of dollars. It is truly, it is the client's money,</p>
<p>they are going where they're going. But we have a sense of actually, okay, where is this actually going? And can you go and say, you
know, across the Ramp buyer base over the next 12 months, this is how many dollars
will go towards you. Can we negotiate a discount? The other way which maybe starts to... Sometimes these businesses
veer closer to advertising, but where it gets really interesting is we see the fastest-growing businesses. What are the businesses that people are getting really excited and are adopting really quickly?</p>
<p>And we might have a signal of these are actually good
businesses and good tools and actually most businesses
should move towards that. Could you go and actually start to say, "Hey, your renewal is
coming up in 90 days. Have you considered this other business who has provided a 20%
complimentary welcome lower price to you?" And so, there's multiple
forms that can take place. But the short version of it is, I think one, it's yes, I think you
can offer a bulk discount. But two, you end up
almost getting closer to,</p>
<p>back to this other theme
of can you start to go and maybe show businesses that directing their next marginal dollar will lead to this outcome. Well, it feels like there's
even like a third thing. Which is, I would call it merchant-specific balance. So imagine that it's December 31st, I'm buying something at Whole Foods. And then I see an offer,
not donate a dollar to the, you know, whatever
charity they're pushing. But it's like, why don't you commit</p>
<p>$2,000 of spend for 2026 for $1,800? And the nice thing there
is that they lock in that spend for me. They actually collect it. I mean I know there's a stupid law and all this complicated stuff. But the key thing is it's
almost a risk management and a loyalty play for them at once. Because the problem is
that they don't know</p>
<p><strong>[45:20]</strong></p>
<p>how much celery to buy. They don't know how many... So, it kind goes back to the AR/AP thing that we were talking about earlier. You nailed it, yeah. Because the other thing
is not just saying, "Hey, I'm going to group bargain on behalf of all the different
customers that I work with." But it's an ancillary
thing, which is you might want to just pre-commit your
spend to a particular vendor. And that vendor would love to
have that spend pre-committed, even if they're Amazon and their cost of capital is very low. Because they know they don't have to worry when they're planning their
budget for the next year. 100%. That you're going to churn in month nine.</p>
<p>And that seems like another, like the closest that you can
get to that is gift cards. Strangely enough which
I'm sure you know well from your— It's gift cards for business.
Yeah because it's like you go to Costco, this is
actually a big business at Costco. You go to Costco, they sell gift cards. We were just talking about this. So they sell gift cards. You can buy $100 of Starbucks
gift cards for 80 bucks. Is Starbucks dumb? Like why are they, if they're worth $100? No, because they basically
have, in the ecosystem, money that is going to
be spent at Starbucks. And yeah, there's
breakage and other stuff, but it's actually a quite, it's quite a valuable value proposition</p>
<p>for the receiving merchant because they know that
you're going to spend your money with them. But I want to go back
to your previous idea where McDonald's every
five years or whatever does a big bake-off between Coke and Pepsi and they always renew with Coke and they have a long-time… Maybe a movie theater
chain is better example. All the big chains, like they
don't serve Coke and Pepsi, they only serve one and
they do a big bake-off between the brands every five years. And you have lots of small businesses that are buying from Coke
or buying from Pepsi. And so, it feels like you
could just do a bake-off between them saying Ramp is
going to have a preferred vendor</p>
<p>and you can obviously use a
Ramp card on either, it'll work, but we have preferred rates with Pepsi. Is that a thing Ramp should do? It's a really interesting question. The short is I think over
the long duration of time. Like I'm kind of bit of a crazy person. We should try everything
is my actual answer. Claude Code.
Yeah, Claude Code. Let's go, let's do it, build it. Pepsi. Make money from Pepsi.
Go and negotiate. The cost of a phone call, a negotiation has never been lower, but… And there's this almost
philosophical question of like,</p>
<p>all right, where is the differentiation? What makes Ramp different? But isn't that increasingly the scale? It is, and I think that
you're right in that at the very beginning of the company, the answer was very easy of like, look, our cost of capital is
nowhere close to a bank's. The interchange that we could
make is nowhere close to it. We have all the disadvantages of scale and kind of the only
thing that we could do</p>
<p>to compete with these people was we could… Everything was slow at the bank that I worked at before, it was hard to ship things. We need to move fast. We need to kind of have this
emphasis around velocity to ship product and just
kind of blitzkrieg faster than maybe others could respond. What it's evolved into and I think is today probably the largest point of
differentiation at the meta level between Ramp and maybe the
financial service providers</p>
<p><strong>[48:25]</strong></p>
<p>that we compete with is they sell money and we sell time. They'll sell you a lower, like a loan at a lower cost of capital, rewards at wherever they set it. We will sell your expenses, done. And so, are you naturally
skeptical of this idea because it's selling money
rather than selling time? I wouldn't say I'm naturally skeptical. I would say that— It's okay. We're not precious. We have lots more ideas. No, no, no. It's good. There is this question of, I think back to our
roots, like, I don't know. How do you build a
product that is 10 times better than other folks?</p>
<p>And I think when you get really large, actually just a line drive is good and a 2x or a 3x is better
kind of thing is actually good. But how do you find these sets of things that other your product
offering is so different than what you can find elsewhere? And I think that we can conceivably, and I know this, you can negotiate with the large logistics companies. A deal with FedEx that would be better than
what most companies are paying and I think that that's interesting. Then you have all the sublevels
of how do you get people to know about the offer,
to sign in to the offer, to deal with all these sub things.</p>
<p>Or you could just go and
spend that next marginal hour to go and say like, let's just automate all of accounting for these customers. Let's go and start doing financial
work for these customers. No financial institution
is able to compete on that kind of vector. And so, I would say it in the fullness of time,
we want to do both. Like I think that you want to save people the maximum amount of time, the maximum amount of money that you can, but I think part of what
makes us so different in this kind of world that we operate in is we have this obsession of</p>
<p>sources of drag of the things
that slow down purchases that lead you to overspend
versus other companies. But just to push on that, I feel like the
differentiation for companies often has to change as time goes on because they start in one
competitive equilibrium. And then as time goes on, they're in another competitive equilibrium because it's dynamic. That's fair.
And it feels to me that Ramp got its start with
very fast product velocity and having this great product experience.</p>
<p>And as you grow up, you
can just build a scale into the product and scale… Scale-derived product advantages. Not just like we're big, but like Costco, the advantage comes from the scale and they really passed
it on to the customer. And it feels like there could be a second stage to this rocket where you get going with
faster product velocity. But then there's actually
a pretty different set of product differentiations
as you scale up. I think it's true. I think it's well said and there's this almost question of like, in every line of business
that we're building,</p>
<p>where are we in the S-curve? How far are we… Is this a product that is serving these tinkerers, early adopters? Are we in the early
majority, are we in the late where we need to shift the
business to kind of harvesting</p>
<p><strong>[51:25]</strong></p>
<p>contribution, optimize
price, not quantity in it or towards the end? And the thing which is so shocking and I think maybe as part
of why I love this business and I think even too, I think about Stripe and many of the great businesses and payments that have been built. I believe today Ramp powers
more than 2% of all corporate and small business card
transactions in the United States. Which is amazing for a business that, the product, you couldn't even
sign up for it six years ago.</p>
<p>And yet that's a really
fancy way of saying 98% of spend is not on us. On Ramp yeah. And let's say we do it again. We grew faster last year than we did the year before. I feel very good about the way this year is starting off and maybe it's closer to four. 96% is still big. 92% is still big. It is so large. And by the way, there's more ways to buy things than just cards. You think about bill payments.</p>
<p>And so, I think that
there is an aspect of, for most people, there's
so much drudgery around... I think people are doing
artisanal expense reports. You know, it's fun to be like a hipster and spend an hour making coffee, but like, it's a little crazy that— This is the blue bottle
of expense reports. You know but unfortunately
you're in Concur and you have like this spinning wheel. It's a pour-over expense report. It's a pour, we love it that way. Single origin. You try it. It's the experience. You're the Nespresso. It's much more efficient.</p>
<p>That's right. But like, what I would
say is this aspect of time is most people have not experienced this thing you know, is just a fact of life for building a business that's been hard doesn't need to be hard. Doing your books doesn't need to be hard. And so, I still think in some sense in where we are on the
S-curves of our business, I lean that way. But you're totally right
when you're at this level where in the not too distant future… I mean, you're there
processing trillions of dollars</p>
<p>per year in economic activity. And we aspire to be there in
the not too distant future. Sounds like you'll be there pretty soon. We're working our hardest. Exponential growth is a powerful thing. Yes, it's definitely given me good things to think about and work towards. So I was thinking about when we met, when you were running Paribus. And it kind of feels like one of the first or second or third order effects
of AI is the marginal cost of arguing has gone down to zero. I'm serious.</p>
<p>It's true.
It's just like, I mean, my wife got into an
argument with some company and it's like she used
ChatGPT to argue with them, they used it to argue back with her. And it's like, I just saw the future. This is incredible. And like, we won, which is great.
Your agent will talk to my agent, yeah. But you think about this from a chargeback where it's like, "Hey, this price went down." I mean this is how we, I remember like, this is such a good idea. It's like the price went down, you have these breakage models
that the card networks had.</p>
<p><strong>[54:27]</strong></p>
<p>And Best Buy has to write you a check or Visa has to write you a check because that TV fell by 20%. But nobody does that. And now everybody's going to do that. Or it's like you do a chargeback for $5, it's just not worth it. It's like, I thought it was Pepsi that
I was buying at McDonald's. It was Coke. Chargeback, right? Nobody's going to dispute that
because the cost is too high, but now the cost goes to zero. So I'm just... What do you think, I mean, it's hard to, picture five years from now what the actual full effects of this are. But if you kind of think about that</p>
<p>as the macro abstraction of it's like marginal cost of arguing goes to zero. What changes? I think to be really explicit, I think what's happening
is the marginal cost of time, of knowledge.
Yes. That is a much better abstraction. Is what's going down so rapidly. And I think about our customer base. Most of our customers don't
have a single software engineer, let alone a software engineer
for their finance team. And if what we are very good at doing is selling functionally sets of work, maybe it's embedded in a
financial operating platform,</p>
<p>but expenses done, accounting done, some type of knowledge work done, and you can deliver that. That is immense high-leverage
value for these customers. Let's say it costs $5 before, they didn't do it, now
they can get $5 of value. But maybe the cost of…
It's a software type cost, maybe it's pennies of tokens
to actually go and do that. That is a great business to be in because it's very high customer value. We can capture just a small amount of that and build this business.</p>
<p>And when you go back to kind of the original insight of Ramp, we entered into this industry
where it was very profitable, but not only was it misaligned, but people were fighting
over like basis points. Every last dollar that went into rewards could have meant like tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in
profit for the business, for them. But if you think about for a customer, let's say that in order to
make one extra basis point as a business, you
would try to incent them</p>
<p>to spend a hundred more dollars. For that customer and let's
say they buy something that gym membership they didn't need, or that subscription keeps going, they have lost $100,
it's gone out the door and maybe they go to the
gym, maybe they don't. But that is out of their bank account. And if you just try to say, I'm going to have a
better rewards program, sure, maybe you can get that customer a dollar or $1.10 back or some amount. That pales in comparison
to helping them just not spend that $100,
cancel the subscription. The economic leverage of
that activity is much higher.</p>
<p>You sold your last business
Paribus to Capital One. Capital One is one of the biggest founder-run financial firms that people in Silicon
Valley don't talk about. What should we all be... And has been extraordinarily successful. What should we all be
learning from Capital One in their success? Actually, I should say, how did they?</p>
<p><strong>[57:28]</strong></p>
<p>What product really broke out for them? Just what is Capital One success? I think there's a lot that makes them amazing as a company. Both the founders are excellent. Rich Fairbank, Nigel Morris. I think it's worth people
reading up on their stories. It was founded in '90s, is that right? So, not quite. From a legal standpoint— I'm very wooly on my Capital One history. I think that legally the
incorporation in some sense for Capital One, it was,
I think it was in 1994, but the actual start
traces back to the '80s.</p>
<p>At the time Rich and Nigel
had met, they were consultants and they had this insight that the business of credit cards was… While it was lucrative, was not
serving most of the country. The way you could kind of think about credit cards back then, you know Diners Club, maybe
others have heard of it. It was was a way for rich business people to get together and have lunch. And like they put the card down</p>
<p>and the restaurant would pick up the tab and they could go and pay
the restaurant back later. And they had kind of navigated that and the simplification is if you had a very high credit score, you could get one of these cards with the benefits that it had. And if you didn't have a
credit score that met that, you could have a debit card. And that was basically it. It was a very linear cutoff. And what Rich and Nigel… The
insight that they had had is there must be some curve.</p>
<p>We should be able to test this. Maybe we give people cards that have above an 800 credit score
or something like that then. But what about 790? There might be people there
that can go and pay for this. If and the way we could go
and take on the cost of this, maybe we charge them a
somewhat higher interest rate until they prove their efficacy. If 790 works, let's go to 780. So it's kind of the BNPL of its day. There is a population who
are, for whatever reason, just below the threshold where banks are giving them good access to credit</p>
<p>where you can actually very
profitably lend to them. This is right. Exactly. And so, they, in the '80s,
were functionally pitching all these different banks to say, "We should go on this exploration. We'll even run this for you. Let us go and run this." And they went door to door
to door to door to door— The banks didn't buy it. They didn't buy it. And then finally, there was a
bank in Virginia, Signet Bank, that said, "Fine, we'll let you run it. You can come join. We'll give you this group</p>
<p>and some resources to go build this." So they built this as this
division inside of it. And it started to work. As this was going on, the computer revolution was taking off and it was sort of an unfortunate acronym, but they called it IBS. Irritable something something. No, it's Information-Based Strategy.</p>
<p><strong>[60:29]</strong></p>
<p>And they said, "We could use
different pockets of data and run these." It was before there was big data, there was this kind of data
of we could go and test. You know, maybe this person has a balance of $8,000 at this bank. We could send them an
offer at this interest rate or this kind of you don't need to pay back interest for six months or 12 months. And they could start to go and see the mathematical
return against this. And this division started really working and it got so profitable it became a problem for the business and they convinced them to spin it out.</p>
<p>And so in 1994, that is
the founding as people know Capital One today. But it actually was I
think almost a decade in building to actually go and do this. I think that there was a lot
that they got really right. One, I think that they took much more of a first-principles
view of the business. Whereas others said, "This
is a profitable product. I'm going to do it like the other person and use scale and
distribution advantages." They said, "Well, let's think about the product nature itself." There's different, everyone's
making money on interchange.</p>
<p>Maybe there's lending could work and you could kind of
have different strategies for different types of populations. They did this so large where I think at one point
they were the largest customer of the US Postal Service. They would send out so many offers I think until Amazon took them over. There was a period of
time that they did this. So it's incredibly experimental. They kind of carved the path and showed how do you go
from credit facilities for fintech founders, eventually maybe you become a bank or buy a bank and carve that path. So there's some tactical lessons. I also think they've done a great job</p>
<p>of building a great and durable brand. One of the things that Capital
One has done very, very well I think has focused on like, what is the consistent visual message? What is the aesthetic
and how do you stand out in this busy and different world? And so, there's a lot of pieces to what's made that company work, but— And they've also remained focused, which a lot of banks haven't. I would say so. Well, I think that is
a rewrite of history. They were doing like cell-phone financing,</p>
<p>healthcare financing. They were a part of this thing. They have come back to focus
after wandering in the woods. They had some JV, it was like America One, I think it was called,
to compete with Amazon. They were actually the most experimental business ever in a lot of ways. In, I think it was
Hibernia Bank in Louisiana. And this was after Hurricane Katrina. I think it was maybe during it or just after they were able to buy. And it was like, it was an
existential question for them. And I think that many
people worried about,</p>
<p>you knew this like, well
too from the BNPL businesses where if you're kind of
a lending-based business, and it's fine when interest rates are low, but if there's a crisis and people don't want to lend to you, it can just break your business. And so they had these kind of scares and they said we need a
stable kind of cost base. Eventually they bought a bank, which was in a lot of ways very good.</p>
<p><strong>[63:29]</strong></p>
<p>They had kind of the deposits
as this durable, stable, low cost of, or consistent capital base. But the flip side of buying it was they had to reconcile their culture of like crazy experimentation
of trying everything to we're a regulated bank now. We got to be bank people. And it's more than just an attitude thing. If you are a nationally chartered bank— It's real strictures, yeah. You know, look, it's to a level of, let's say the bank fails on Monday night.</p>
<p>There is personnel. These guys in windbreakers
in your office the next day. And they've probably been working there for some time before. You know, and so it's... I think there was a change. In some sense, there is experimentation I think within certain constraints would be how I would describe the Capital One post buying
a bank versus before would be my read of it. But when you look at them
in the '90s and 2000s,</p>
<p>it was like them and in some ways, like name the high flying tech company. They were right up there in
terms of share price growth. They started re-achieving it
I think in the late 2010s. But it's a fascinating company. I mean, I think the talent pool. So at Affirm, our first like
really good risk person, but this is true for
every fintech company. It's just like, actually
this is kind of cool. Billy Alvarado, our first
COO grew up at Capital One. I had played the piano and my teacher was taught by somebody who was taught by somebody.</p>
<p>There was actually a chart,
you can look this up. Czerny and Beethoven taught everybody who ever taught anybody. So like Lang Lang or Yuja Wang, like pick any famous pianist today. They can always trace their lineage 100% of the time to Czerny,
Carl Czerny or Beethoven. Capital One is like the Czerny. Our Head of Risk Srinath
Srinivasan, he's amazing, came from Capital. We had the same boss
10 years apart actually, in some sense. And all the heads of risk
for all modern fintechs</p>
<p>came from Capital One. Well, because it's one
of these things where you know that you don't want
to just hire for intercept, you want to hire for slope. And this is the problem is like you find, not to pick on Bank of America or Chase or somebody,
but it's like, all right, this person clearly knows
how to do their job. The bank that they work in
is worth a lot of money. But they don't necessarily have, how do I put this delicately, the slope. They won't know what that means because they don't know what slope means. But seriously, the guy that we hired just so… He was very, very smart. And that was the key
thing about Capital One</p>
<p>is that they didn't hire banking people, they just hired smart people. And it became known as the
place where smart people went. And actually the fact that
companies would poach people from Capital One actually
added to the alert. It's like, I want to work at McKinsey because at the end of McKinsey, I'm going to get a better job
somewhere else. Capital One job market. Capital One actually had, it did have that imprimatur. And I think part of it is</p>
<p><strong>[66:29]</strong></p>
<p>it's the only founder-led institution. Last question, Eric. We're talking about banking here. You have a treasury product. In five years, where do businesses keep their money? Is it with, I mean statistically mostly, you mentioned 2% on Ramp, it's even higher today
in traditional banks like a Chase or a Bank of America. There's also neobanks, you know, I mean kind of bank-like
entities like Mercury or Revolut or Monzo or things like that. There are companies like Ramp where you started in spend cards,</p>
<p>but maybe moving more into treasury. How do you think that
shakes out as a market? So, as a macro point, I think there is an
incredible amount of money made by institutions who
are enjoying the profit pool and sharing very little
with their end customers. You know, if you think
about the implications of like the federal overnight funds rate. This is basically saying, hey, if you want to go and— Just it's insane that there's
so little yield sharing in the current market.</p>
<p>It's crazy. I think that the national
average for businesses, right, these are sophisticated
entities with personnel. They're supposed to be able to manage and put their funds in some
place that's more high yield. I think the national average on checking accounts is 0.07% in the US. And so I'm guessing you don't believe that Bank of America and JP
Morgan and all these folks will wake up more altruistic one day. And so, what is the competitive process by which you think we'll get there? I think that new businesses, whether it's they have their own charter</p>
<p>or they work with banks too that, this is not a monopoly. Like they have, everyone has competitors and it is a market that evolves. I think that that rate will go up, that the easier it is for people to, whether it's to create
depository institutions, create accounts at these institutions, or create stores of value maybe even outside of these systems, maybe in a stable currency. And so, I think that rate goes up. I think part of what's driven
the extremely rapid growth of Ramp Treasury is it's just</p>
<p>a vastly better deal for customers. Maybe you keep three months of just walking around money
in your checking account, but if you know the funds
you're going to receive and what you're paying out, well, we can move funds on the day payroll is coming due into that account and then every other day make
sure the funds are earning the highest rate possible. And so, I think from a macro perspective, these things tend to go up in
terms of the relative yield. I think there's another
question of slack in the system. If you have more and more...</p>
<p>Money can think, right? If the dollars in your company have some level of intelligence like it's able to kind of determine when can it be spent,
under what circumstances? It's increasingly recorded in real time</p>
<p><strong>[69:33]</strong></p>
<p>and there's some reasoning around this, some ability to kind of opine of where should the
next marginal dollar go? And you have systems that are able to think infinitely about these things even at 3:00 AM in the morning when most of your team is asleep. Well, once you determine, like maybe you'll determine
I should keep the funds in some level in like a 2%
or a 4% yielding account. But I think more of those
dollars will go in flight actually to go spend to,
if you have a business that makes an 8% profit margin a year, that's a lot higher than what you can earn</p>
<p>in the overnight rate. And so in some sense, I think
you have the dual effect. Smarter capital allocation. I think more dollars will be put to work. I agree with Alex's macro point of if you kind of understand counterparties, you understand more information. I think that one, the cost
of financing should go down and I think more dollars should be in the system in some sense. It's actually a waste for everyone to have your dollars just
sitting in a bank account. Who does that benefit? But it goes back to your time point. And it's like the reason why I got mad at Chase a while ago,</p>
<p>and I still have a Chase account. And like why is that? It's like I have a life insurance policy. I don't remember the login for it. It's just too much work. I wrote, this is a true story. Isn't this an issue if you die? Yeah, I mean. Well, but they'll pay my wife. I just don't know how to log in and change the bank account. So, they'll send her a nice
letter I'm sure, some flowers. But, you know, why... Well actually, this is a true story. I wrote a check for
somebody's bar mitzvah. Mazel tov. Has not been deposited. Do I want to be the schmuck
who has the bounced check? No, I don't.</p>
<p>So it's like I have to— This kid is keeping you at Chase. Well, great to see you. You too.
Eric, thank you. Thanks for the Guinness. It was a great time.</p>]]></content:encoded>
