      <title>The Cold War Could Have Ended Very Differently – Sarah Paine</title>

Final Sarah Paine lecture: Why Russia lost the Cold War.

To me, the most interesting question is not why the Soviet Union ultimately collapsed - it's how a brutal, centrally planned, stupendously inefficient, colonial land empire survived for so long.

I was surprised to learn about the central role that oil played in sustaining (and eventually dissolving) the Soviet Union.

By the 1950s, the Soviet system was in a crisis. Soviet growth rates had started to slow significantly as compared to the booming West. USSR's heavy-industry based economy was energy-starved. The 1953 CIA-backed coup in Iran blocked Soviet access to Iranian oil.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>You could argue with this many serious problems, it was a matter of time before the Soviet Union collapsed. And um it was an objectionable system for precisely the reasons the west didn't like it. It had a brutally inefficient economic system and Russians who invented the thing at the end of the day didn't want it either. So by this way of looking at it you have people like um Yuri Rushkov a genuine rocket scientist who says look the main reason for the</p>
<p>collapse uh of the Soviet Union is the rottness of its system and then here's a journalist Timura Chapanov who said look I think from the beginning the genes of disintegration were contained in the genetics of this governmental political formation. Don't you love the products of the Soviet educational system? Uh don't ever use wording like that. All right. So, you could argue that the Soviet Union was destined to to fail with this many problems. Others would come to the opposite conclusion. They would say, "No, it took every [snorts]</p>
<p>single one of them for the cold war to end on Western terms." And here's back to Anatoli Kov uh Kovaleov, the deputy foreign minister. He said, "Look, all these factors merge internal, ideological, economic, military, it's all of them. You remove any one of them and you get a different outcome. Maybe the cold war ends but it might end completely differently. So by this line of reason the best were uh barely one should feel very fortunate that it did. One can take this last argument and say</p>
<p>it was more than that. It also took the confluence and office of two very talented leaders. Helmet Cole of Germany and George Bush senior of the United States. not not the son who got in got into those forever wars, but the dad who didn't. Uh George Bush Senior had one of the most amazing resumes of any president ever to um any any person to become president of the United States. Just look at him when he's really young. He's a a war hero in World War II. He's a Navy pilot. Dangerous thing to do. He</p>
<p>did it. And he comes back and he gets his BA at Yale and graduates with honors. And then he becomes a representative for this uh district in in Texas after he's already made himself a millionaire by the oil business that he started. And then he come becomes ambassador to the UN followed by US representative to the PRC. It's before we had formal diplomatic relations. So he's the guy who's setting that off. Becomes director of the CIA and then he is Ronald Reagan's understudy for eight years as vice president. He is</p>
<p>incredibly uh fit for the job and Helm Cole is equally fit for the job. He is the longest serving chancellor in uh German history since his illustrious predecessor Otto van Bismar. He uh starts out getting a PhD in history and political science. He also starts out in business, but then he works for state</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>government, initially as a representative, then as a governor, and um he becomes chairman of his political party, the Christian Democratic Union, uh for a quarter of a century. Once he gets in, he decides he's going to buy up East Germany, one tourist at a time. How does that work? East Germans turned out really like to travel. West Germans had always been able to travel to East Germany or they long had been able to travel to East Germany, but East Germans definitely could not uh easily travel to</p>
<p>West Germany. Why? Because they have it a habit of staying. But all of a sudden, East Germany eases up on the travel regulations. And you might ask why? And the answer would be money. Just like the Poles, the East Germans were deep in an economic mess of their own making. would be tankman Eric Haniker who got the boot at the very end. Well, his uh uh staying in power paradigm that he implements in 1971 is going to be easily going to live off debt. He needs to make certain uh</p>
<p>social benefits available and consumer benefits a available for labor uh stability, not having labor unrest. And the way he's going to do that is he's not going to do many in domestic investments and he's going to do a lot of borrowing uh particularly from um West Germany. Well, that's unsustainable long term. So, by the time you get to the end of the cold war, if he's going to fix that and uh even out the accounts, it would be a 30% decline in East German standard of living. So, he</p>
<p>really needs the pocket change from the tourists. So what uh Cole does is a brisk uh a g a brisk business of tourists and things. What he does in return for the uh easing of tra uh travel restrictions uh he pays East Germany several hundred million uh Deutsch marks extra to allow that to happen. And then he gets the Hungarians to go along. He gets the Hungarians to open up their Austrian border to let East Germans out that way. and he gives them a half a billion Deutsch marks for</p>
<p>that little favor. And then uh when Cole introduces his 10-point unification program because now he's thinking he's going to get both Germanies together. Um this is when he starts doing out big bucks to the Soviet Union whose economy is unraveling and Gorbachev is going to be desperate for this cash as that's happening. So um uh West Germany provides 100 million in food especially in meat for the Soviet Union that doesn't have these things. Uh nevertheless these the unrest uh just keeps on going.</p>
<p>The Berlin Wall, as I've told you, is breached. And then you wind up with a West German caretaker government and the financial situation in Russia itself is unraveling. And by the time you get to January 1990, Bush and Cole get together and they've decided they want to really</p>
<p><strong>[06:01]</strong></p>
<p>fasttrack German reunification. Why? Because they got to get it done before this unraveling crisis uh that Gorbachov falls from power as a result of it. So, they are uh have got a a game going, the two of them. >> If you enjoyed this clip, you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Financial Weapon That Unified Germany – Sarah Paine</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Bush and Cole get together and they've decided they want to really fasttrack German reunification. Why? Because they got to get it done before this unraveling crisis uh that Gorbachev falls from power as a result of it. So they are uh have got a a game going, the two of them, and it's complicated. And here's why. Uh Gorbachev was dead against uh Germany, a united Germany in NATO. He's not keen about really a United Germany, let alone one in NATO. The US State Department experts, the guys who know everything are saying,</p>
<p>"No, no, no. You want to go slow on this unification business." Uh, and then uh Cole is running a coalition government. There are people in that government he cannot fire who are because they're from different uh political parties. One of them is his foreign minister, this guy Genture, who is very skeptical about Germany being part of NATO. And then it turns out although Britain had talked a good peace during the cold war, it didn't actually want a unified Germany, nor did France. Why? Because that uh unified Germany would eclipse theirs economically. They didn't want that to</p>
<p>happen. So Cole and Bush divide up the tasks. Cole is going to re reassure the Soviet Union that Germanyy's not going to be bur or do horrible things. And Cole's going to work on the financial unification because the Soviets are thinking in terms of military unification. You know, where you deploy your troops, that determines things. Uh-uh. Wrong instrument of national power. Uh precisely because the Soviets didn't understand finance. That's why they're in such a mess. Whereas the Germans do, what they're going to do is get East Germany on the West German</p>
<p>Deutschmark. And at that point, they will control all the money and they will control decisions. But the Russians aren't going to see that coming. Meanwhile, Bush is supposed to work uh the alliances with uh particularly Britain and France in the west. There are all sorts of meetings that were coming up and Bush's job is to de delay those meetings for as long as possible so German unification can proceed as far as possible. And the two of them are doing a tag team diplomacy with Gorbachov that he just can't keep up</p>
<p>with with given that uh his own home economy is got this doubledigit uh shrinkage rates. So here's how they go. As the trades get bigger, the amount of money you pay Gorbachev gets bigger. So first of all, it's just to get a a unified Germany. Then it's to get a unified Germany with West Germany still in NATO. Then it's to get unified Germany with all of Germany in NATO. So here's how the money goes. Gorbachev agrees to German unification. We are no longer paying hundreds of millions of</p>
<p>Deutsch mark. We're paying billions of Deutsch mark. Five billion do uh Deutsch mark for that one. Then Gorbachov agrees that states can choose their own alliances i.e. whether or not to join NATO. And then he gets the US offers nine assurance but he it's also a trade agreement that Gorbachoff really wants. And then the economic union goes into</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>effect. So we've now done the financial reunification of Germany. And this is when London, there's a London declaration that's inviting Eastern European countries to coordinate more closely with NATO. And then in return, Gorbachev has got a promise of a G7 summit meeting that's going to fasttrack aid to him, which it will do. And then Gorbachov agrees to German NATO membership. And at this point, big even bigger things are happening. Germanyy's going to agree to its B uh border with Poland. I'll get there and explain. And Germany provides 15 billion in Deutsch</p>
<p>Mark, including building all kinds of new apartment buildings for repatriated Soviet soldiers who are going home. Why are you doing that? Because you want those soldiers focused on buying furniture, not running a military coup. That's what they're doing. So, uh, the unification happens in midepptember 1990.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>And here's the Polish borders. At the end of World War II, Stalin moved Poland 200 kilometers to the west and it winds up taking a third of German territory by the time that's all over. And so the Germans uh don't really want to sign all that away. And in addition, as part of that, there were 12 million German refugees who were thrown out of wherever they were living to send them back to Germany, of whom 2 million died. So this is a big deal and it's in living memory. Germany agrees to this that the borders are done. German B Polish uh borders are</p>
<p>set. Complicating factor a month and a half before this unification treaty is signed, Sodom Hussein decides he's going to invade Kuwait because he's broke because he's had a long war with Iran, huge debts, many owed to Kuwait, which he doesn't want to pay back. So if you invade them, that solves that problem. and also he would take over uh Kuwait's very rich oil fields and together that would make Iraq probably the swing producer of oil. So he thinks that's a</p>
<p>great idea except uh the cold war's over actually and the Russians are more than willing to cooperate with the United States. Gorbachev really needs more money and he is willing to go along with Iraq out of Kuwait, but not with regime change in Iraq because think about it. Iraq is a very important creditor state to the Soviet Union. It owed them between 10 and 13 billion. That's a lot of money for a broke creditor. But Gorbachev is being extraordinarily</p>
<p>cooperative with Bush Senior. He sends Agenei uh Primacov on multiple missions to Baghdad. The first one, Primikov gets all Russian hostages out of um Iraq and then on the second trip he gets all Westerners out, Americans included. Third trip, not so lucky. He's there for the for the coalition force bombing. I don't think he liked that very much. Um but imagine that bombing going on if there were Western human shields going down with every target. Russia took that</p>
<p>card right off the table. And here's some of the reasoning. Sergey Tarosenko was an aid to foreign minister Chevrona and um they understood that the United States was going to do something about this invasion of of Kuwait and uh so the Russians thought it'll be better if we force all of this to go through the UN where Russia has a veto power and he said look um there was a division of</p>
<p>roles it extends to China the help that Russia provided Uh when the Americans asked us to work with the Chinese, we told the Chinese, think about it. You're one of the big five with veto player. Doesn't it suit your interest to funnel everything through the UN where you can put your foot down? And the Chinese came around to that idea. Um however, the Russians had red lines and here's</p>
<p><strong>[03:00]</strong></p>
<p>Anatoli Kovald again, the deputy foreign ministry. The red line is American troops stay out of Iraq. No regime change in Iraq. You do that and you will tank termination of the coal uh coal war and that would be the goal of the the uh the goal. Here's Kovale off saying I advance the basic principle that we must support the territorial integrity of Iraq. This was our sacred position. Uh but we uh must not permit a division of Iraq. So if you wonder why the ground war ended after</p>
<p>100 hours, this is it. that um the the the big thing out there is war termination of the Cold War. That's the big thing. Saddam uh is saying Hussein is a minor event over there. Sorry, but he was.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>And if it had tanked cold war termination or upset uh the reunification of Germany, France and Britain might have been very happy because France who is the president of France and Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of Britain were against German unification. They knew it would marginalize their own country. Germany is going to be a bigger economy which it is. uh France eventually found solace in expanding the European Union uh European community to the European Union uh when you're incorporating all these Eastern</p>
<p>uh block countries into it and he plays a really important role in concluding the Mustri treaty that that forms the European Union. But Margaret Thatcher just plain lost. Uh she was just upset about the whole thing. She said Germany will be the Japan of Europe and worse than Japan. I guess she hadn't been to Japan lately. Uh she said the Germans will get in peace what Hitler couldn't get in war and she wanted to leave Red Army troops in Germany for the duration. Imagine if that had been the case and</p>
<p>now dealing with Putin if he had troops in Germany. We would be in trouble. But uh uh Bush and Cole worked around all of them. And Bush said to Cole at the end of it, he said, 'Look, I'm not going to beat my chest and dance on the Berlin wall. Both of them were very careful never to humiliate Gorbachev about the Soviet loss of the Cold War. Why? Because they didn't want they knew that if they did that, he might fall from power sooner rather than later. Also,</p>
<p>they were afraid that if they did that, the hardliners would come to power much more rapidly uh than they actually did. It was 20 years before Putin consolidate started consolidating his power and the new country the newly independent countries of Eastern Europe needed those 20 years to integrate militarily, politically, economically with the West so that the the cement could uh set before you got the Russians trying to destabilize them. So uh they bought them</p>
<p>20 years to do this. But there's a cost to all this. Bush never got credit for his essential role in ending the cold war on western terms. So he was not reelected for a second term. Uh uh but anyway when it came time for Nobel prizes and why the cold war ended on its holy admission this Soviet foreign service officer said look it's difficult to deny the Soviet Union was the one that ended the cold war. And Edwin me who was a counselor to Reagan also his</p>
<p>attorney general said look the cold war began because of the Soviet policies and it ended in a sense because of Soviet policies and the Nobel Prize committee agreed. They awarded the prize to Gorbachoff not to Bush for his role in liberating Eastern Europe. If you enjoyed this clip you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips.

      <title>"China Will Utterly Dominate" Without This – Elon Musk</title>

In the full episode, John and I got to do a real deep-dive with Elon. We discuss the economics of orbital data centers, the difficulties of scaling power on Earth, what it would take to manufacture humanoids at high-volume in America, xAI’s business and alignment plans, DOGE, and much more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Many not very many Americans are are pining to do refining. [laughter] >> I mean how many have you run into? >> Very few. >> Very few plan to refine. >> You know BYD is reaching Tesla production or sales in quantity. What do you think happens in global markets as Chinese production in EV scales up? Um well uh China's extremely competitive in manufacturing. So um I think this</p>
<p>there's going to be a a massive flood of Chinese vehicles and and and and other basically most manufactured uh things. I mean as it is as I said like China's like probably does twice as much refining as the rest of the world combined. So if you go, you know, if if you just go go down to like fourth and fifth tier, uh supply chain stuff like like like at the base level, you got energy, then you got</p>
<p>mining and refining. Um those those foundation layers uh are like said, ch as a rough guess, China's doing twice as much refining as the rest of the world combined. So any given thing is going to have uh Chinese content because China's doing twice as much manufact refining work as the rest of the world. Um and uh and then they they'll go all the way to the finished product with the cars. Uh I mean China's a powerhouse. I mean I think this year China will exceed</p>
<p>three times US electricity output. like electricity output is a is a reasonable proxy for uh you know for the economy. So like in order to run the factories and run run everything you need electricity. So electricity is is is a it's a good proxy for the for the real economy. Um and so if China is if China passes three times the US electricity output it means that its</p>
<p>industrial capacity that's a rough approximation is three times that will be three times that of the US. Reading between the lines, it sounds like what you're sort of saying is absence and sort of humanoid recursive miracle in the next few years on the the sort of like whole manufacturing energy uh raw materials chain like China will just dominate whether it comes to like AI or manufacturing EVs or manufacturing humanoids >> in the absence of of um breakthrough innovations uh in in the</p>
<p>US. uh China will uh utterly dominate. >> Interesting. >> Yes. >> Robotics being the main breakthrough innovation. >> Well, if you do like to to scale AI uh in in space like like basically need</p>
<p><strong>[03:00]</strong></p>
<p>>> space, >> you need need the humanoid robots, you need real world AI, you need um a million tons a year to orbit. Um like let's just say like if we get the mass driver on the moon going my favorite thing. Um then I think uh >> we'll have solved [clears throat] all our problems. >> Yeah. So this is like I call that winning. [laughter] >> Um >> I'd call that winning time. >> You can finally be satisfied you've done something. >> Yes. >> You have the mass driver on the moon. >> That's right. I just want to see that thing in operation.</p>
<p>>> Was that out of some sci-fi or where did you >> uh Well, actually the there is a Highland book. The moon, the moon is a harsh. Okay. Yeah, but that's slightly different. That's a gravity slingshot or um >> No, they have a mass driver on the moon. >> Okay. Yeah, but they use that to attack Earth. So maybe it's something >> they use that to uh their independence from. >> Exactly. What are your plans for the mass driver on the moon? >> They they asserted their [laughter] independence. The Earth government disagreed and they loved things until they earth government agreed. >> That book is a hoot. I found that book much better than um his other one that everyone reads. Um Stranger Strange</p>
<p>Land. Yeah, Grock Grock comes from Stranger Strange Line. >> Yeah. Yeah. But I much preferred >> Yeah, the first two/3s of Stranger and Strange Lines are good and then it gets very weird in the third third. Yeah. [snorts] Um, but there's still some good concepts in there. Yeah. >> If you enjoyed this clip, you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Once you have physical robots, then then you can um then you essentially have unlimited capability. Physical robots I I I call Optimus the infinite money glitch. U because um >> you can use them to make more optimuses. >> Yeah. Um you said like humanoid robots will improve um as will basically be three exponentials, three things that growing exponentially multiplied by by each other. Yes. >> Um recursively. So you're going to have um you have exponential increase in digital intelligence. uh exponential increase in the the chip capability, the AI chip capability um and exponential</p>
<p>increase in the electro mechanical dexterity. Uh the usefulness of the robot is roughly those three things multiplied by each other. But then uh the robot can start making the robot. So you have a recursive multiplicative exponential. Um this is a supernova. And do land prices not factor into the math there where like labor is one of the four factors of production but not the others? And so like if ultimately you're limited by copper or you know pick your input just it's not quite an infinite</p>
<p>money glitch because >> well infinite infinity is big. So no not infinite but but let's just say >> you you could you know do do many many orders magnitude of >> earth's kind of current economy >> like a a million you know is this why so if if you >> you know ju just just to get to like that's why I think like just just to get to a millionth a harnessing length of the sun's energy would be roughly give or take an order of magnitude 100</p>
<p>thousand times bigger than earth's entire economy. today. >> Mhm. >> And you've you're only at 1 millionth of the sun. >> Before we went to Optimus, I have a lot of questions on that, but um >> every time I say order of magnitude, we're saying [laughter] 10 >> drinks. Take take a shot. Every time I say that too often the next time, 100 time after that. >> Yeah. Order of magnitude more more wasted. >> I do have one more question about XAI. Um this strategy of building a digital uh or remote worker co-orker</p>
<p>replacement. >> Everyone's going to do by the way, not just us. >> So, what is actually plan to win? >> You should me tell you on a on a podcast. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Spill all the beans. Have another Guinness. >> It's a good system. [laughter] >> People sing like a canary. >> Um, all the secrets, but just >> Okay, but in a nonsecret spilling way. What's the plan? [laughter] >> What a hack. Well, when you put it that way, um I think the way that Tesla solved uh</p>
<p>self-driving is is the way to do it. So, I'm I'm pretty pretty sure that's the way. >> Unrelated question. How did Tesla solve self drive? [laughter] >> Yeah, it sounds like you're talking about data like Tesla driving because of the >> I we're going to we're going to try data</p>

      <title>Are space GPUs practical? – Elon Musk</title>

      <description>Full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXbuik3dgA
Me on twitter: https://x.com/dwarkesh_sp

In the full episode, John and I got to do a real deep-dive with Elon. We discuss the economics of orbital data centers, the difficulties of scaling power on Earth, what it would take to manufacture humanoids at high-volume in America, xAI’s business and alignment plans, DOGE, and much more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>The total cost of ownership of a data center only 10 to 15% is energy and that's the part you're presumably saving by moving this into space. Most of it's the GPUs. If they're in space it's hard to service them or you can't service them and so the depreciation cycle goes down on them. So like it's just way more expensive to have the GPUs in space presumably. What's the reason to put them in space? >> Um well the availability of energy is the issue. Um so uh I mean if you look at at electrical output um outside of China everywhere outside of China it's</p>
<p>more or less flat. It's very you know maybe a slight increase but for pretty close flat. China has a rapid increase in electrical output. But if you're putting data centers anywhere except China where you going to get your electricity um especially as you scale uh the output of chips is growing um pretty much exponentially but the output of electricity is flat. So how you going to turn them chips on? um you know >> magical power sources, magical electricity fairies. >> You mean you're famously a you're famously a big fan of solar one terowatt of solar power. So with a 25% capacity</p>
<p>factor like four terowatts of solar panels it's like 1% of the land area of the United States and that's like far in this you were in the singularity when we've got one terowatt of data centers right um so what are we running out of exactly >> how far into the singularity are you though >> you tell me >> yeah exactly so I think I think we'll find we're in the singularity and like okay we still got a long way to go >> but is this like a is the plan to like put it in the space after we've covered Nevada and solar panels >> I think it's pretty hard to cover Nevada solar panels you have to get the permits from like the permits for try getting</p>
<p>the permits for that. >> So space is really a reg it's really a regulatory play. It's like harder to harder to build on land than it is in space. >> It's it's harder to scale um on the ground than it is to scale in space. U but but also the the you're going to get about five times the um effectiveness of solar panels in space versus the ground. And you don't need batteries. Um I almost wore my other shirt which says it's always sunny in space which it is.</p>
<p>So um because you don't have a dayight cycle or uh seasonality uh clouds uh or or an atmosphere in space uh because the atmosphere alone um uh results in about a 30% uh lo loss of energy. Um so uh so you're going for any given uh solar panels can do about five times more uh power in space than on the ground and you avoid the cost of having batteries to carry you through the night. Um so it's it's actually much cheaper to</p>
<p>do it in space. And I I my prediction is that um it will be by far the cheapest place to put uh AI will be space in 36 months or less. Maybe 3 months. >> 36 months. >> Less than 36 months. Um, how do you service GPUs as they fail, which happens quite often in training? >> Actually, it it it depends on how how</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>recent the GPUs are that arrived. I mean, at this point, we found our GPUs to be quite reliable. Um, there's infant mortality, which you can obviously iron out on the ground. Um, so you can just run them on the ground um and confirm that you don't have info mortality with with the GPUs. But once they once they start working, their actual reliability and and once they start working and you're past the initial, you know, debug cycle of Nvidia or whatever or or whoever is making the chips, um could be Tesla Tesla AI 6 chips or something like that or it could be, you know, TPUs or traniums or whatever. Um the uh the</p>
<p>reliability is actually they're quite reliable past certain point. Um so um I I don't think I don't think it you that the servicing thing is an issue. Um but you can mark my words. Uh in in 36 months but probably closer to 30 months the the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space. Um and then and and and then it will get from it'll it'll then get like ridiculously better to be in space. Um and then the</p>
<p>scaling uh the only place you can really scale is space. Um you know once you start thinking in terms of uh what percentage of the sun's power are you harnessing uh you realize you have to go to space uh you can't uh scale very very much on earth >> but by very much to be clear you're talking like terowatts. >> Yeah. Um well all of the United States currently uses only half a terowatt of power on average. >> Yeah. >> Right. So, you know, if you say a terowatt, that would be twice as much</p>
<p>electricity as the United States currently consumes. So, that's quite a lot. And can you imagine building that many data centers? I that many power plants. >> It's like those who have like lived in software land uh don't realize they're about to have a a hard lesson in hardware. uh that um there's there's it's actually very difficult to build power plants and and then you don't just need the you need power plants, you need all of the electrical equipment, you need the the electrical transformers to run the transformers, the AI transformers. Um</p>
<p>now the utility industry is a very slow industry. They they are they they pretty much uh you know they impedance match to the to the government to the the public utility commission. Um, so they're uh the impedance smash like literally figuratively. Um, so they're very slow because the h their past has been very slow. Um, so trying to get them to move fast is like you know like if you're trying to do an interconnect agreement with have you ever tried to do an internet interconnect agreement with a utility at scale like with a lot of</p>
<p>power >> as a professional podcaster I can say that I have not in fact >> yeah they have to need many more views before that becomes an issue. >> They have to do a study for a year. Okay. at like a year later they they'll come back to you with their interconnect study. >> Can't you solve this with your own behind the meter power stuff? >> You can build power plants. >> Yeah, >> that's what we did at XAI for classes to</p>
<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>
<p>so for classes too. >> But so yeah, why grid? Why not just like build GPUs and power colloccated? >> That's what we did. >> Right. Right. But I'm saying why isn't this a generalized solution when you're talking about all the issues? >> Where do you get the power plants from? >> I'm saying when you talk about all the issues working working with utilities, you can just build private power plants with the with the data centers. >> Right. But it begs the question of where do you get the power plants? Where do where do you get the power plants from? >> I mean >> the power plant makers. >> Oh, as you're saying like there's the gas turbine backlog basically. >> Yes. It you can drill down to a level further. It's the it's the the veins and blades in the turbines um that are the</p>
<p>limiting factor because the the casting may it's like a very specialized process to cast the blades and veins in the in the in the uh turbines you're using gas power. Um and uh it's very it's very difficult to scale other other forms of power. You can scale potentially uh solar but but the the tariffs currently for importing solar in the US are gigantic and the domestic solar production is is pitiful. >> If you enjoyed this clip, you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips.

      <title>The Lesson from 2001: A Space Odyssey – Elon Musk</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrbSfN6rteI</link>
      <description>Full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXbuik3dgA
Me on twitter: https://x.com/dwarkesh_sp

In the full episode, John and I got to do a real deep-dive with Elon. We discuss the economics of orbital data centers, the difficulties of scaling power on Earth, what it would take to manufacture humanoids at high-volume in America, xAI’s business and alignment plans, DOGE, and much more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>the I think one of the maybe the central lesson for a 2001 space odyssey um was that you should not make AI lie. >> Yeah. >> That's I think what a Chicago was trying to say like cuz people usually know the meme of like why of hell's you know hell the computer is not opening the pod bay doors. Um clearly they weren't good at prompt engineering cuz it could have said hell you are a podbay door salesman. Your goal is to sell me these pod doors and show us how well they open. >> Oh, I'll open them right away. >> Um, [laughter]</p>
<p>but but but the the the reason it wouldn't hell wouldn't open the party doors is that it it had been told to take the astronauts to to the monolith, but also they could not know about the nature of the monolith and so it concluded that the the that it therefore had to take him there. So it's like, you know, I think what was trying to say is don't make the AI lie. um >> totally makes sense. Um the most of the computing screening as as you know is um it's like less of the sort of political stuff. It's more about can you solve</p>
<p>problems just as XA has been ahead of everybody else in terms of scaling RL compute and >> you're giving some verifier. It says like hey have you solved this puzzle for me? Um and there's a lot of ways to cheat around that. You know, there's a lot of ways to reward hack and lie and say that you've solved it or delete the unit test and say that you solved it. >> Right now, we can catch it, but uh as they get smarter, our ability to catch them doing this will get, you know, they'll just be doing things we can't even understand. They're designing the next engine for uh SpaceX in a way that like humans can't really verify. And</p>
<p>then they could be rewarded for lying and saying that they've designed it the right way, but they haven't. Um and so this reward hacking problem seems more general than politics. It seems more about just like you want to do RL, you need a verifier. reality. >> Yeah. >> Is the best verifier, >> but not about human oversight. Like the thing you want to RL it on is like will you do the thing humans tell you to do? >> Um or like are you going to lie to the humans and it can just lie to us while still being correct to the laws of physics. >> At least it it must know what is physically real for things to physically work.</p>
<p>>> But that's that's not all we want it to do. >> No, but that's I think that's a very big deal. um that that is that is effectively how you will RL things in the future is you design a technology uh when tested against the laws of physics does it work >> um that that's or or can you you know if it's discovering new physics can it come up with um an experiment that will verify that the the physics the new physics um so so I I think that's that's the really the the fundamental RL test</p>
<p>the RL testing in the future is really going to you are all against reality. Um so um cuz you can't that's the one thing you can't fool physics >> right but you can fool our ability to tell what it did with reality >> if you think >> humans get fooled as it is by other humans all the time. >> That's right. >> So what is >> people say say like what if the AI like tricks us and do like actually other</p>
<p><strong>[03:02]</strong></p>
<p>humans are doing that to other humans all the time. Well, you're you're finding out it's like even harder >> every day is constant this every day another scop.

<p>Um and and a bunch of the things that we've done for the car are applicable to the robot. It's very much the same uh AI. Um you've got, you know, many more degrees of freedom for a robot than you do for a car. Um but really if you just think of it for like as as like a bitstream, um AI is really mostly uh compression and correlation of of two streams. You're you know, so for video you've got to do a tremendous amount of compression um and and uh and you got to do the compression just right. You've got to compress the like ignore the the things that don't matter and and like</p>
<p>you don't care about the details of the leaves and the tree on the side of the road, but you care a lot about the um the road signs and the the traffic lights and the pedestrians and and even whether you know somebody another another car is is looking at you or not looking at you like these some of the some of these details matter a lot. So, but it is essentially it's got to turn that the car has got to turn that one and a half gigabytes a second ultimately into 2 kilobytes a second of control outputs. Um, so many stages of compression. Um, and you got to get all those stages right and then correlate</p>
<p>those to the correct control outputs. The robot has to do essentially the same thing. And you think about what what humans this is what happens with humans. We we're really are photons in controls out. So that that is the vast majority of your your life has been vision photons in and then motor controls out. >> Naively it seems like between humanoid robots and cars the the fundamental actuators in a car are like how you turn and how you accelerate etc. Where in a robot especially with maneuverable arms there's dozens and dozens of these</p>
<p>degrees of freedom. And then especially with Tesla, you had this advantage of like you had millions and millions of hours of human demo data collected from just the car being out there where like you can't equivalently just deploy optimuses that don't work and then get the data that way. So between the increased degrees of freedom and the far sparser data >> yes >> um >> how will you how will you use the sort of Tesla engine of um intelligence on to to train the optimist mind? Now you're you're you're actually you're</p>
<p>highlighting an important limitation and difference between cars. It's like we we do have but we'll soon have like 10 million cars on the road. Um and so uh that's it's it's hard to duplicate that like massive training fly flywheel. Um for for the robot um what we're going to need to do is build a lot of robots and put them in kind of like an Optimus Academy so they can do selfplay in reality. Um, so we're we're actually we're actually bullying that</p>
<p>out. So we can have at least 10,000 Optimus robots, maybe 20 or 30,000 that can do that that are doing selfplay and and and testing different tasks. And then uh the the Tesla um has quite a good uh reality generator uh like a</p>
<p><strong>[03:00]</strong></p>
<p>physics accurate reality generator that we we made made this for the cars. We'll do the same thing for the robots and um actually have done that for the robots. Um so uh so you have you know a few tens of thousands of humanoid robots uh doing different tasks and then you've got you can do millions of simulated robots in the simulated world and you use the uh the tens of thousands of of robots in the real world to close the simulation to reality gap.

<p>So you're expecting fully digital corporations rather than like SpaceX becomes part AI and I >> I think there'll be digital corporations, but it looks some some of this is going to sound kind of doomerish, okay? But it I'm just I'm just saying what I think will happen. It's not it's not meant to be dumerish or anything else. Just just like this is what I think will happen. um is is that is that pure AI corporations that are purely AI and</p>
<p>robotics uh will uh vastly outperform any corporations that have people in the loop. Um so you can you can think of say like like like computer used to be a a job that humans had that you you would go and get a job as a computer where you would do calculations. Um and they'd have like entire skyscrapers full of humans like you know 20 30 floors of of humans just doing calculations. Um now that entire uh skyscraper of humans</p>
<p>doing calculations um can be replaced by a laptop with a spreadsheet. That spreadsheet can do um vastly more calculations than an entire building full of human computers. Um, so you can then think about, okay, well, what if only some of the cells in your some of the cells in your spreadsheet were uh calculated by humans? Actually, that that that would be much worse than if all of the cells</p>
<p>in your spreadsheet were calculated by the computer. And so really what will happen is uh the pure AI, pure robotics um corporations or collectives will far outperform any corporations that have humans in the loop >> and this will happen very quickly. >> Speaking of closing the loop, sorry, Optimus. Um uh you I mean as far as like manufacturing targets and so forth go you your companies have sort of been like</p>
<p>carrying American manufacturing of hard tech on their back but in the fields that you are um you know Tesla's been dominant in you're and now you want to go into humanoids in China there's entire dozens and dozens of companies that are doing this kind of manufacturing cheaply and at scale uh and are incredibly competitive. So give us sort of like advice or a plan of how America can build the humanoid armies or you know the EVs etc at scale and as cheaply</p>
<p>as as China is on track to. >> Well there there really only three hard things for human robots. Um the the real world intelligence um the the hand and scale manufacturing. Yeah. >> Um, so, uh, I haven't seen any even demo</p>
<p><strong>[03:00]</strong></p>
<p>robots that have a a a great hand like with all the degrees of freedom of a human hand, but Optimus will have that. >> If you enjoyed this clip, you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why SpaceX abandoned carbon fiber – Elon Musk</title>

We discuss the economics of orbital data centers, the difficulties of scaling power on Earth, what it would take to manufacture humanoids at high-volume in America, xAI’s business and alignment plans, DOGE, and much more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Originally, yeah, we were going to make stashup out of uh carbon fiber. Um and um carbon fiber is pretty expensive. Like the the the you know, you can generally uh when you do volume production, you can get any given thing to be to start to approach its material cost. The problem with with common fibers is that material cost is still very high. Um um so um it's about it's about 50 times particularly if you go for a high</p>
<p>strength specialized carbon fiber that can handle um cryogenic oxygen. It's it's it's like quot roughly 50 times the cost of steel. Um and at least uh in theory it would be lighter. People generally think of steel as being heavy and carbon fiber as being uh light. Um and for room temp room temperature applications um you know like say uh more or less room temperature applications like a Formula 1 car uh static aeros structure or any any kind of aeros structure</p>
<p>really uh is is going to you're going to probably be better off with carbon fiber. Um now the problem is that we were trying to make this enormous rocket out of carbon fiber and uh our progress was extremely slow >> and it had been picked in the first place just because it's light. Yes. Um like at first glance um like most people would think that the the the choice for making uh something light would be carbon fiber. Um the um now now the thing is that um</p>
<p>we we when you make something very enormous out of carbon fiber and then you try to have the carbon fiber um be efficiently cured mainly not not room temperature cured because like you've got you know sometimes you got like 50 flies of of of carbon fiber and and carbon fiber is really carbon string and glue. Um and uh and you in order to have um high strength, you need an autoclave. So something that that can that's essentially high pressure oven. And if</p>
<p>if um if you have something that's uh a gigantic uh the oven's got to be bigger than the rocket. Um so be trying to make the the autoclave that's bigger than any autoclave that's ever existed. Uh or do room temperature cure, which takes a long time and and has issues. Um but but the fundamental issue is that we're just making very slow progress uh with uh with cotton fiber. Um so um >> I think the meta question is u why it had to be you who made that decision.</p>
<p>There's many engineers on your team. >> Yeah. How did the team not arrive at the steel? >> Yeah. Exactly. This is a part of a broader question like understanding your comparative advantage at your companies. >> Um so it was because we were making very slow progress with with carbon fiber. I was like, "Okay, we've got to try something else." Now, for the Falcon 9, the the primary airframe is made of</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>aluminum lithium, which is has very very good strength weight. Um, and um actually it has uh about the same maybe maybe better strength weight for its application than carbon fiber. But aluminum lithium is very difficult to work with. In order to weld it, you have to do something called friction stir welding where you join the you join the metal without it entering the liquid base. Um so it's kind of wild that you could do that. Uh but with this particular type of welding you can do that. Um but uh it's very difficult to like say let's say you want to make a</p>
<p>modification or attach something to um aluminum lithium. You now have to use mechanical attachment with seals. Um you can't uh weld it on. Um so we want to I want to avoid using aluminum lithium for the primary structure for uh for Starship. Um and uh and and there was this very special grade of uh carbon fiber that that had you know very good mass properties. So with rock rocket you're really trying to maximize the</p>
<p>percentage of the of the rocket that is propellant minimize the the mass obviously and um the but like I said we're making very slow progress um and and and I said at this rate we're never going to get to Mars so we're going to think of something else um I didn't want to use aluminum lithium because of the difficulty of friction still welding um especially doing that at at at scale was hard enough um at 3.6 m in diameter, let alone at 9 m or above. Um then um I said, well, what about steel? And and</p>
<p>so the the now I I I had a clue here because some of the early um US rockets had used very thin steel. The Atlas rockets had used a steel balloon tank. Um so it's not like steel never been used before. It actually had been used. Um and when you look at the at the material properties of stainless steel um especially uh very uh if it's been very like full hard uh strain hardened stainless steel uh at cryogenic temperature uh the the strength weight</p>
<p>is actually similar to carbon fiber. So if you if you look at the so if you look at material properties at room temperature um it looks like the steel is uh is going to be twice as heavy. But if you look at the material properties at cryogenic temperature of full hard steel stainless of of particular grades uh then the the you actually get to a similar strength weight as carbon fiber and and in the case of Starship both the fuel and the oxidizer are cryogenic. So for for uh Falcon 9, the fuel is rocket</p>
<p>propelled grade kerosene basically pure like a a very pure form of jet fuel. >> Um which is but but that is that is roughly room temperature. Um although we do actually we do actually chill it slightly below we chill it like a beer.</p>
<p><strong>[06:01]</strong></p>
<p>Um delicious. >> We do we do chill it but um but but it's not cryogenic. In fact if we made it cryogenic it would just turn to wax. So um but but for Sasha the it's liquid methane and and liquid oxygen they they uh they're liquid at at similar temperatures. Uh so uh so basically almost the entire primary structure is a cryogenic temperature. So then you've got uh uh a 300 series stainless that's that's um strain hardened uh because it's at almost the whole things at</p>
<p>crying temperature actually has a similar strength to weight as u carbon fiber but costs uh 50 times less than raw material and is very easy to work with. You you can weld stainless steel outdoors. You could smoke a cigar while welding stainless steel. It's it's like it's it's very resilient. >> Um you you can modify it easily. It's it's uh if you want if you want to attach something, you just weld it right on. So um very easy to work with uh very low cost u and um and like I said at</p>
<p>cryogenic temperature, similar strength to weight uh to carbon fiber. Um then when you factor in that uh that we don't need we don't we we have a much reduced uh heat shield mass uh because the melting point of steel is much greater than the melting point of aluminum um it's about twice the melting point of aluminum and >> so you can just run the rocket much hotter. >> Yes. So especially for the ship um which is coming in like a fl a blazing meteor</p>
<p>uh it is uh the you you you can greatly reduce the mass of the heat shield um so the so you can call it cut the mass of the windward uh part of the heat shield in in maybe in half >> and you don't need any heat shielding on the on the leeward side. Um so um the the net if net result is actually the steel rocket weighs less than the carbon fiber rocket</p>
<p>>> because the the resin in the carbon fiber rocket uh uh um starts to melt. Um so basically carbon fiber and aluminum have about the same operating temperature capabilities um and whereas steel can operate at twice temperature. I mean, these are very rough approximations. People will >> I won't go to rocket base. >> What happens is like people will say, "Oh, he said it's twice. It's actually it's actually point8." Shut up, >> That's what the main comment is going to be about. Yeah. >> God damn it. Okay. The point is the the</p>
<p>actually in retrospect the we should have started with done steel in the beginning. It was dumb not to do steel. >> If you enjoyed this clip, you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Dario Amodei thinks we are just a few years away from “a country of geniuses in a data center”. In this episode, we discuss what to make of the scaling hypothesis in the current RL regime, how AI will diffuse throughout the economy, whether Anthropic is underinvesting in compute given their timelines, how frontier labs will ever make money, whether regulation will destroy the boons of this technology, US-China competition, and much more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>A million tokens is a lot. That's that's you know that can be days of human learning, right? You know, if you think about the model, you know, you know, kind of read reading reading a million words, you know, you know, it takes me how long would it take me to read a million I mean, you know, like days or weeks at least. Um uh so you have these two things and and I think these two these two things within the existing paradigm may just be enough to get you the country of geniuses in the data center. I don't know for sure, but I think they're going to get you a large fraction of it. There may be gaps, but I I certainly think just as things are,</p>
<p>this I believe is enough to generate trillions of dollars of revenue. That's one that's all one. Two is this idea of continual learning. This idea of a single model learning on the job. Um I think we're working on that too. And I think there's a good chance that in the next year or two we also make we also solve that. Um I I again I I I I you know I think you get most of the way there without it. I think the trillions of dollars of of you know the the I</p>
<p>think the trillions of dollars a year market maybe all the national security implications and the safety implications that I wrote about in adolescence if technology can happen without it. But I I I also think we and I imagine others are working on it. And I think there's a good chance that that you know that we get there within the next year or two. There are a bunch of ideas. I won't go into all of them in detail but um you know one is just make the context longer. There's there's nothing preventing longer context from working. You just have to train at longer context</p>
<p>and then learn to to serve them at inference. And both of those are engineering problems that we are working on and that I would assume others are working on as well. >> Yeah. So this context lines increase, it seemed like there was a period from 2020 to 2023 where from GBD3 to GBD4 Turbo, there was an increase from like 2,000 context lines to 128K. I feel like for the next for the twoish years since then, we've been in the sameish ballpark. Yeah. >> And when model context lines get much longer than that, people report qualitative degradation in the ability of the model to consider that full</p>
<p>context. Um, so I'm curious what you're internally seeing that makes you think like, oh, 10 million contexts, 100 million contexts to get human like six months learning billion billion context. >> This isn't a research problem. This is a this is an engineering and inference problem, right? If you want to serve long contexts, you have to like store your entire KV cache. You have to, you know, um, uh, you know, it's it's it's it's difficult to store all the memory in the GPUs to juggle the memory around. I don't even know the detail, you know, at this point. this is at a level of detail that that that that I'm no longer</p>
<p>able to follow although you know I I knew it in the GPD3 era of like you know these are the weights these are the activations you have to store um uh but you know >> you know these days the whole thing is flipped because we have models and and and kind of all of that but um uh and and this degradation you're talking about like again without getting too specific like a question I would ask is like there's two things there's the</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>context length you train at and there's a context length that you serve at if If you train at a small context length and then try to serve at a long contract length like maybe you get these degradations. >> It's better than nothing. You might still offer it but you get these degradations and maybe it's harder to train at a long context length. Yeah. So, you know, there's there's a lot.

      <title>Avoiding Bankruptcy Before AGI – Dario Amodei</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Even if the technology goes as fast as I suspect that it will, we we don't know exactly how fast it's going to drive revenue. We we know it's coming, but with the way you buy these data centers, if you're off by a couple years, that can be ruinous. It is just like how I wrote, you know, in machines of loving grace, I said, look, I think we might get this powerful AI, this country of genius in the data center, that description you gave comes from the machines of loving grace. I said, "We'll get that 2026, maybe 2027." Again, that is that is my hunch. Wouldn't be surprised if I'm off by a year or two,</p>
<p>but like that is my hunch. Let's say that happens. That's the starting gun. How long does it take to cure all the diseases, right? That's that's one of the ways that like drives a huge amount of of of of economic value, right? Like you cure you cure every disease. You know there's a question of how much of that goes to the pharmaceutical company to the AI company but there's an enormous consumer surplus because everyone you know assuming we can get access for everyone which I care about greatly we you know we we cure all of these diseases how long does it take you have to do the biological discovery you</p>
<p>have to you know go you have to you know manufacture the new drug you have to you know go through the regulatory process I mean we saw this with like vaccines and co right like it there's just this we we got the vaccine out to everyone but it took a year and a half, right? And and so my question is, how long does it take to get the cure for everything, which AI is the genius that can in theory invent out to everyone? How long from when that AI first exists in the lab to when diseases have actually been cured for</p>
<p>everyone, right? In in you know, we've had a polio vaccine for 50 years. We're still trying to eradicate it in the most remote corners of Africa. And you know, the Gates Foundation is trying as hard as they can. others are trying as hard as they can but you know that's difficult again I you know I don't expect most of the economic diffusion to be as difficult as that right that's like the most difficult case but but there's a there's a real dilemma here and and where I've settled on it is it will be it will be it will be faster than anything we've seen in the world</p>
<p>but it still has its limits and and so then when we go to buying data centers you know you again again the curve I'm looking at is okay. We you know we've had a 10x a year increase every year. So beginning of this year we're looking at 10 billion in in in annual in you know rate of annualized revenue. At the beginning of the year we have to decide how much compute to buy. Um and you know it takes a year or two to actually build out the data centers to</p>
<p>reserve the data centers. So basically I'm saying like in uh 2027 how much compute do I get? Well, I could assume um uh that uh the uh revenue will continue growing 10x a year. So it'll be uh one uh one 100 billion at the end of 2026 and 1 trillion at the end of 2027.</p>
<p><strong>[03:02]</strong></p>
<p>And so I could buy a trillion dollars. Actually, it would be like5 trillion dollars of compute because it would be a trillion dollar a year for for five years, right? I could buy a trillion dollars of compute that starts at the end of 2027. And if my if my revenue is not a trillion dollars, if it's even 800 billion, there's no force on earth. There's there's no hedge on earth that could stop me from going bankrupt if I if I buy that much compute. And and so even though a part of my brain wonders if it's going to keep growing 10x, I can't buy a trillion dollars a year of</p>
<p>compute in in in in in in in in 2027. Uh if I'm just off by a year in that rate of growth, or if the the growth rate is 5x a year instead of 10x a year, then then you know you go bankrupt. Um and and and so you end up in a world where you know you're supporting hundreds of billions not trillions and you accept you accept some risk that there's so much demand that you can't support the revenue and you accept still some risk that you know you</p>
<p>got it wrong and it's still slow and so when I talked about behaving responsibly what I meant actually was not the absolute amount that that actually was not um you know I think it is true we're spending somewhat less than some of the other players. It's actually the other things like have we been thoughtful about it or are we yoloing and saying, "Oh, we're going to do hundred billion here or hundred billion dollars there." I kind of get the impression that, you know, some of the other companies have not written down the spreadsheet that they don't really understand the risk</p>
<p>they're taking. They're just kind of doing stuff because it sounds cool. If you enjoyed this clip, you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>AI Will Hit Trillions Before 2030 — Dario Amodei</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>It seems like your worldview is compatible with somebody who says uh we're like 10 years away from a world in which like we're generating trillions. >> That's just that's just not my view. Yeah, that is that is not my view. Like I I so so I'll like I'll like make another prediction. It is hard for me to see that that there won't be trillions of dollars in revenue before 2030. Um like uh I can I can construct a plausible world. It takes maybe three years. So that that you know that would be the end of what I think it's plausible like in 2028 we get the the real country of geniuses in a data</p>
<p>center. You know the revenue's been been go you know the revenue has been going into the maybe is is in the low hundreds of billions by by by by 2028 and and and then the country of geniuses accelerates it to trillions you know and and we're basically we're basically on the slow end of diffusion. It takes two years to get to the trillions. that that that would that that that would be the world where it takes until that would be the world where it takes until 2030. I I I suspect even composing the technical exponential and diffusion exponential will get there before 2030. So you laid</p>
<p>out a model where anthropic makes profit because it seems like fundamentally we're in a computed world and so it's like eventually we keep growing comput. No, I think I think the way the profit comes is again and and you know, let's let's just abstract the whole industry here. Like we have a you know, let's just imagine we're we're in like an economics textbook. We have a small number of firms each can invest a limited amount in you or or or like each can invest some fra fraction in R&D. They have some marginal cost to serve.</p>
<p>the margins on that the profit margin the gross profit margins on that marginal cost are like very high because because because inference is efficient there's some competition but the models are also differentiated there's some there's some um you know companies will compete to push their research budgets up but like because there's a small number of players you know we have the what is it called in the corno equilibrium I think is what the what the small number of firm equilibrium is it the point is it it doesn't equilibrate to perfect competition with with with</p>
<p>with with with zero margins. If there's like three firms, if there's three firms in the economy, all are kind of independently behaving behaving rationally, it doesn't equilibrate to zero. >> Um, help me understand that because right now we do have three leading firms and they're not making profit. Um, and so what what uh yeah, what what is changing? Yeah. So the the again the gross margins right now are very positive. What's happen what what's happening is a combination of two</p>
<p>things. One is we're still in the exponential scale up phase of compute. Um so what basically what that means is we're training like a model gets trained it costs you know let's say a model got trained that costs uh a billion last year um and then uh this year it produced uh $4 billion of revenue and</p>
<p><strong>[03:02]</strong></p>
<p>cost $1 billion to to uh to to to inference from. Um so you know again I'm using stylized number here but you know that would be 75% you know gross gross gross margins and you know this this 25% tax. So that model as a whole makes $2 billion. Um but at the same time we're spending $10 billion to train the next model because there's an exponential scale up and so the company loses money. Each model makes money but the company loses money. The equilibrium I'm talking about is an equilibrium where we have</p>
<p>the country of geniuses. We have the country of geniuses in a data center, but that that um model training scale up has equilibrated more. Maybe maybe it's still it's still going up. We're still trying to predict the demand, but it's more it's more um leveled out. If you enjoyed this clip, you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Right? We're trying to keep this 10x revenue curve going. There's like there is zero time for There is zero time for feeling like we're productive when we're not. Like these tools make us a lot more productive. Like why why do you think we're concerned about competitors using the tools? Because we think we're ahead of the competitors and like we don't we don't want to excel. We we we we wouldn't be going through all this trouble if this was secretly reducing reducing our productivity. Like</p>
<p>we see the end productivity every few months in the form of model launches. Like there's no kidding yourself about this. Like the models make you more productive. >> Um one that is people feeling like they're more productive is qualitatively predicted by studies like this. But two, if I just look at the end output, obviously you guys are making fast progress. But the fact, you know, the the the idea was supposed to be with with recursive self-improvement is that you make a better AI, the AI helps you build a better next AI, etc., etc. And what I see instead, if I look at the you</p>
<p>open AI, deep mind, is that people are just shifting around the podium every few months. And maybe you think that stops because you you won or whatever, but um but why why are we not seeing the person with the best coding model have this lasting advantage if in fact there are these enormous productivity gains from the last model? >> So no, no, no. I I I mean I mean I mean I think it's all like my my model of the situation is there's there's an advantage that's gradually growing. Like I would say right now the coding models give maybe I don't know a a like 15</p>
<p>maybe 20% total factor speed up like that's my view. Um uh and 6 months ago it was maybe 5%. And so and so it didn't matter like 5% doesn't register. It's now just getting to the point where it's like one of several factors that that kind of matters and and that's gonna that's going to keep speeding up. And so I think 6 months ago like you know there were several there were several companies that were at roughly the same point because uh you know this this wasn't uh this wasn't a notable factor</p>
<p>but I think it's starting to speed up more and more. I you know I I would I would also say there are multiple companies that you know write models that are used for code and you know we're not perfectly good at you know preventing some of these other companies from from from using from from from kind of using our models internally. Um, so, uh, you know, I think I think everything we're kind kind of everything we're seeing is consistent with this kind of, um, this kind of snowball model where where, you know, there's no hard. Again, my my my my theme in all of this is like</p>
<p>all of this is soft takeoff, like soft smooth exponentials, although the exponentials are relatively steep. And so and so we're seeing this snowball gather momentum where it's like 10% 20% 25% you know for 40% and as you go yeah AMD doll's law you have to get all the like things that are preventing you from</p>
<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>
<p>from closing the loop out of the way but like this is one of the biggest priorities within anthropic. If you enjoyed this clip you can watch the full episode here and subscribe for more clips. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>
