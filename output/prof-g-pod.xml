      <title>Trump SPARKS Culture Wars MELTDOWN to Bury the Epstein Scandal</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH-tW89Kgzo</link>
      <description>Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov explore a weekend that showcased two very different Americas: Bad Bunny celebrated unity across the continent, while Donald Trump leaned into culture wars, attacking an Olympic skier for expressing mixed feelings about representing the U.S. and amplifying a racist video of the Obamas. At the same time, Congress is reviewing Epstein files, Ghislaine Maxwell is publicly hinting at clemency deals, and Trump’s allies are facing political scrutiny. They also break down Trump’s economic message ahead of the midterms — from AI-driven growth claims to foreign investment promises — and whether everyday Americans are actually seeing the benefits. Plus, they tackle the skyrocketing cost of NYC private schools, now topping $70,000 a year at elite institutions, and what it means for families navigating a struggling public system.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:04]</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Raging Moderates. I'm Scott Callaway >> and I'm Jessica Tarlov. >> Today we're going to talk about how Trump stirs culture wars to distract from Epstein, Trump's economic pitch ahead of November elections, and if private school is worth it. If you haven't already, please make sure to subscribe to our YouTube page to get up-to-date coverage on everything happening. All right, let's get into it. Over the weekend, two very different versions of America on display. One on stage, Bad Bunny turned a major pop moment into a celebration of joy and unity, naming every country across the Americas and reminding audiences that America is bigger than any one flag or administration. At the same time,</p>
<p>President Trump was doing what he's done for years, picking cultural fights. He went after an Olympic skier for expressing mixed feelings about representing the US, amplified a racist video depicting the Obamas, and once again leaned into grievance and division. And the timing matters because as Trump fuels these outrage cycles, Congress is quietly reviewing unredacted Epstein files, we should put unredacted around in quotes, Gelain Maxwell is publicly floating clemency for silence and senior figures tied to Trump, including his commerce secretary, are facing bipartisan calls to resign over</p>
<p>their Epstein ties. Jess, before we get into Ebstein, what stood out to you about the wave of culture war fights Trump picked over the weekend? What really stood out to me is how ineffective I feel like he's become. Like he's really lost his fast ball. You know, they think they call it the weave that he does, right? Where he like finds a way to get a question that he doesn't like and then he goes some other path and you know, somehow his base plus the extra 10% that voted for him or whatever, like understands what he really meant and all is forgiven. And it</p>
<p>doesn't really feel like that's happening anymore. um or at least when it comes to these culture war things like Epste, which we'll get into, people actually do care about it even though he continually tells them not to um on the Bad Bunny performance. Uh you don't spend a lot of time on Twitter. I think you spent zero time on Twitter actually. Um but it was really interesting to see prominent conservatives coming out and defending Bad Bunny's halftime show. um including Alexis Wilkins who's Cash Patel's girlfriend, the one that he's flying all</p>
<p>over the country to see on our dime. But she said Republicans need to unite and get on better messaging because this branding is fantastic and allows all Dems to get behind it also super aesthetic. Uh Chris Rufo uh super right-wing defended it. Um Nick Fuentes uh who does go through many phases um but he said it's literally fake outrage self ghettoizing being overly political pretending to like the things we have become the far-left that's about the obsession with you know the kid rock show and he said that looked like me</p>
<p>familiar that's like all my cousins I think I recognized a few people there and on the horrible racist video of the Obamas depicting them as apes that came out Laura Ingram um who hosts the 7 o'clock show on Fox had Caroline Levit on and asked her about it, said, "Can you really throw a staffer under the bus?" And Levit tried this, "Oh, well,</p>
<p><strong>[03:05]</strong></p>
<p>this is a leftist media narrative." And she's staring at Laura Ingram, right? Saying that this is a leftist media narrative. So, it feels like the [ __ ] is being called a bit more. I I'm not predicting some downfall of the Trump administration, but it it does feel like he is not hitting his marks in the same way and he's not able to dangle like one trans swimmer in front of people to get them to come over to his side and the people are actually</p>
<p>observing what's going on on the ground and uh formulating a not so positive view of Trump and co as a result. What did you think about the uh outrage over all the the cultural war stuff that's going on? >> Well, I first off, I have absolutely no interest in Bad Bunny. I couldn't name a song that he sings. But at the same time, I look at the economics of it. It was a brilliant move by the NFL. The NFL is investing in the future. People under the age of 18 are the majority are non-white and this is the most popular artist in the world. So, of course, they should have him as their halftime show.</p>
<p>And I thought the halftime show was optimistic and well produced. I I watched it the next day. So, I think this was a big win for the NFL. Um, and a big win. And I just, you know, I'm no no one on the Republican side has asked me, but for them for them in their carnival barkers to come out and say he wasn't speaking English, and how's that going to help them with the Latino vote? And >> yeah, >> these cultural icons have such a huge followership and these artists that to</p>
<p>not kind of and then I think what was even worse and again I'm biased here but Kid Rock's thing looks so sad. >> Yeah. >> It just looked like okay this is you know this is sort of what like if meth had a concert. It just felt really desperate. It felt really you know not very well produced and kind of weird. Um, so I don't I I think he picked the wrong culture war. They picked the wrong culture war here. The other observations, the things I found</p>
<p>most fascinating about the Super Bowl had nothing to do with Bad Bunny. But by the way, I think the the threads account of Elmo had it perfectly that Elmo just hopes both teams have a really fun time. And he said, "Bad Bunny isn't a bad bunny, he's a good bunny." Both both those made me laugh. But the thing I noticed was that a quarter of the ads were AI. >> Yeah. >> So it was sort of the AI bull. And the last time tech dominated was in 2022. It was called the cryptob because a quarter of the ads were crypto things like FTX</p>
<p>and Binance. We know what happened there. And then the time before that where you breached 25% of the Super Bowl ads being from tech companies was in 2000 and we know what happened there. So if economic history repeats itself, we're about to see a major draw down in AI. And the other thing that the Super Bowl kind of conoted for me was I think there's been an enormous transfer in</p>
<p><strong>[06:06]</strong></p>
<p>power and value from the betting sites. Remember the big ad a few years ago with Salahek as as um Cleopatra, it was bet MGM and companies like Flutter have been on a roll. Flutter [ __ ] the bed and missed its earnings. I think everyone's moving from wagering to these speculation markets. And I think you saw that in the Super Bowl, but I I think they're on, and again, I'm biased here. I think they're on the wrong end of the I I think it would have been genius for them to say, "Love the Super Bowl was great. Bad Bunny was was great." I I</p>
<p>just think they I I think being associated with Kid Rock, you just look lame. >> Yeah. But they like >> there is an inability to ever be graceful about absolutely anything. I mean they couldn't even I'm talking about the administration, not the examples that I read out, but they couldn't even deal with reality that like a straight couple got married at the Super Bowl show, right? like there's nothing more pro pro- family and a lot of people are pointing that out like this is quote your quote unquote</p>
<p>conservative values and you know I've seen the translations of the lyrics like yeah Bad Bunny says some dirty things like Kid Rock saying one of his original hits which is completely profane I know it was supposed to be his redemptive arc for when he found Jesus or whatever but like it's just [ __ ] entertainment for what like I >> you like some shows you don't like other ones. I certainly thought it was less politically hostile or whatever you want to call it than Kendrick Lamar's was. I mean, his message was together we are</p>
<p>America, God bless America, led with the American flag. >> It seemed lovely. It reminded me of uh Ronald Reagan's great speech where he said, "You can be an Italian and move to Switzerland, but you'll never be Swiss. You can be Japanese and move to Mexico, but you'll never be Mexico. But all of these people can move to America and be Americans." I just I love that and it's true, right? And seeing all those flags, you know, our our strength is that essentially we're the operating system</p>
<p>for every other country that aspires to be democratic and prosperous. The US used to be the operating system legally, morally, economically for the entire West and people who aspire to be like the West. And when I saw those flags, I just thought of it as, you know, their their different cultures mostly operating or aspiring to our operating system. Let's move on. Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnik, is under bipartisan pressure over alleged lies about his relationship with Epstein. I don't know if you've seen here in the UK, there's calls uh Ky thinks there's a</p>
<p>70% chance that Kier Starmer is going down. Not because he's in the Epstein Files, but because he recommended a cabinet poster for someone who's in the Epstein Files. I mean, that's that's the bar here versus our president, who, by the way, this is just some fun facts. Trump is mentioned</p>
<p><strong>[09:06]</strong></p>
<p>in the Epstein Files more than Jesus is mentioned in the Bible or the term meth is mentioned in all eight seasons of Breaking Bad. >> That's my fun fact for the day >> as the main character energy. What do you think's going to any thoughts on what's going to happen with Secretary Lutnik here? >> Well, we're recording this mid testimony. So, I don't know what else will come out, but I people are going to be looking into whether he perjured himself, whether he said in any sort of official forum that he didn't associate with Jeffrey Epstein past 2005. I think it was in his confirmation hearing. Um</p>
<p>but he went to the island to have lunch with his brought all his kids there um in 2012. And I really think that you know it needs to be a far bigger part of the discourse on this that so much of this is happening after Jeffrey Abstein is a convicted sex offender that he is a registered sex offender in 2009 and business continued as usual um in many respects. Um, so I, you know, I think Letic would be an easy person to push</p>
<p>out. He seems dug in about Christy Gnome. Um, but Letick doesn't really bring a lot of positivity, um, or glow to the administration. And remember early on we were talking about how he was giving the worst interviews of anybody and they actually had to take him off of TV um, because he was doing such a crap job. Um, so I could see that happening. It's all part of just this overwhelming narrative um that's taking shape and you know three million documents that's</p>
<p>going to take months and months to be able to sift through and then also to be able to connect dots between things because sometimes you you know you see an email and you don't know what it's a response to, right? Or where it fits into the whole story. Um but I was watching uh Roana has done a couple long form podcast interviews with Shawn Ryan. Have you ever watched the Shawn Ryan show? >> I haven't. He's really interesting. He's a former Navy Seal. Um was a Blackwater contractor uh with the CIA. He has a podcast. They have like 5.5 million</p>
<p>subscribers on YouTube. Um very conservative guy and he is part of this new cadre of traditional Trump supporters that are losing their minds over the Epstein files. and not looking at this at all through a partisan lens, but just saying how is it possible that people in positions of power are not interested in getting to the roots of all of this to understanding what went on here, especially when it has to do with the abuse of children in many cases. Uh Jamie Rascin came out of the</p>
<p>viewing room and said that the youngest victim that they saw was 9 years old, >> right? We're talking a 9year-old. And I was thinking back, remember Megan Kelly a few months ago made that crazy comment like, "Well, we're not talking about 5-year-olds. We're talking about 14year-olds." And she was, you know, said, "I'm not justifying it." But well, now you're talking about a 9-year-old. So a 9-year-old is more like a 5-year-old, right, than is like a</p>
<p><strong>[12:07]</strong></p>
<p>14-year-old. They haven't gone through puberty, right? You're talking about a kid. And Roana was talking about how he and Thomas Massie uh want like a truth and reconciliation committee to be enacted to get to the bottom of this Epstein web, which I think would be interesting. It doesn't get people any solutions right off the bat, but it feels like it's very necessary because the questions you're getting more questions than answers from all of this. Like who is Jeffrey Abstein? John Ryan thinks he was a Mossad agent. I mean,</p>
<p>the connectivity to other nations. Um, oh my god. And the difference also in his business pre and post conviction is fascinating too. How he shifted to older girls, a lot of Russians and Eastern Europeans and was working in that part of the world. The kind of business deals that he was doing with heads of major financial institutions, his relationship with the Rothschilds, for instance, these titans of tech. I mean, Roana said he's I represent a lot of these guys, right? He's the Silicon Valley</p>
<p>congressman and there splatter Elon Musk, Peter Teal all over it. So, you know, questions. Was he a foreign intelligence asset? Was he a US intelligence asset? He had access to the CIA for God's sakes. Like, he was in skiffs. So, who is this guy? And I've also shifted and I don't know if you have as well. Like we were talking about pedophile last week and now I guess my tinfoil hat is on a bit more and you're looking at all of the stuff that's coming out in the emails and thinking was this guy also just like a straight</p>
<p>up murderer like ordering 330 gallons of sulfuric acid. Do you know that he had a trapoor in his house that went to the sea which is like the perfect place to dump bodies? We now know that the FBI never searched his New Mexico ranch where it's rumored that he has bodies buried there, that the FBI wiped the footage from his prison cell and that they might have taken a dummy body and put it in the cell and that they slipped him out so no one would notice. Um, these quarterly payments to the head of</p>
<p>Ohio State's gynecology department that he was paying him thousands of dollars. Like what the [ __ ] is going on here? And also, this is very QAnon, but like all of the code words that they're using, things like white tuna potentially meaning a dead white woman. I feel a little Clare Danes and Homeland. Yeah, it's I think this is such a an erosion and degradation of our institutions because my understanding is the FBI</p>
<p>files or the Epstein files were compiled and aggregated by a law enforcement agency. And my sense is when a law enforcement agency uh aggregates a file, the output is supposed to be indictments, not a 1% semi, you know, sclerotic</p>
<p><strong>[15:08]</strong></p>
<p>release, non-release, redaction. We didn't redact things. We did such that millions of bloggers with a ring light could interpret it to their political advantage and find outrage where there shouldn't be any or excuse child rape as being mixed in with other outrage. And having Silicon Valley tech bros say, "Oh, well, you were there more times than me." And this is an unpopular opinion, but I think a criminal file should speak to the public. I think it's their job to use all their tools and go</p>
<p>through and say, "Okay, what warrants public disclosure and what doesn't?" Because I think what we've ended up doing is diluting all the crime. Now, whether or not information on Howard Lutnik, a cabinet secretary who lied about his involvement, and it was clearly more than that, whether that should be released, I can see justification for releasing that. But did he commit a crime? And if he didn't commit a crime and it's a criminal investigation, then it's fun to shame these people. And it's great fodder for interpreting it. It makes for great media and great clicks. And it's great for the Trump administration because</p>
<p>it's diluted the fear here that the president was involved in potentially um enabling a pedophile ring. But this has just eroded these institutions where it's like, okay, who can we trust to parse through this and figure out who is criminally liable here and get a subpoena from a a grand or indictment from a grand jury and who is on the wrong invite list. I think this whole thing has just been handled so poorly and will be looked back on as something</p>
<p>that absolutely molested and dented and just perverted the reputation of our institutions because we don't even know how to conduct an investigation and then parse it out and what the outcome should be. And it's something something that I've been thinking a lot about. Derek Thompson, who I had on Profy Conversation, said just as we've only been skirting along the surface of the atmosphere at 710 the speed of sound for about 30 or 40 years, 95% of the public was not taking supersonic travel or or</p>
<p>subsonic travel. Jet lag. Our species just doesn't know how to react to the sun coming up 5 hours before it's supposed to. So, our bodies get whacked with jet lag. Eventually, over, I don't know, 100, 200, 500 years, we'll adapt. Is our species ready for all of us to be broadcasters and for files like this to be released to all these people who think of themselves as people who can parse through this stuff and then broadcast it in a thoughtful way? They can't. And so this just seems like a melee where who gets caught in the scrum</p>
<p>is our institutions. And I think the FBI under a competent president with distinct branches of government charged with fidelity to their oath and what they're supposed to do would have come out with a subreport saying, "Okay, today we are announcing 24 criminal indictments against the following people</p>
<p><strong>[18:09]</strong></p>
<p>and this is the evidence against them. We have also disclosed the following people who are in positions where it's important to the public." Yeah. I just I think so much of this is just gossip and people not gossip but people who just love one of the things I don't like about our brothers and sisters on the left is we seem I think we need a massive redistribution of income and they're much more interested in a massive redistribution of virtue and yeah this person's a creep. Yeah, it's it makes your skin crawl but that the FBI isn't in the business of disclosing things</p>
<p>that make your skin crawl and make people look like creeps. That's not what they're there for. They're there for criminal indictments. And all of this what I'll call redistribution of virtue is diluting from the premise from from the whole shooting match here. And that is we need to put in place a series of incentives where no matter how rich and powerful you are, if you any way provide the infrastructure, traffic, or enable or conduct child rape, we're coming for you.</p>
<p>And it it strikes me that this is the best thing that happened. The way this has been parsed out sclerotically was a gift to the people who have actually committed crimes here because it's diluted the whole thing. Let's talk about Gelain Maxwell. Where do you think her case goes from here? >> I don't think anywhere that she wants it to. I mean, it's been really interesting to see the folks coming out of the DOJ's reading room. So, I don't know if you know about how it's designed, but it has just four computers in it. And there's</p>
<p>no way to your point about how poorly this has been done or or rolled out that there's no easy way to search through it. I mean, people are basically just taking what they can and reading it and you have to do it in the room. So, people are spending, you know, hours in there. Um, Rascin said that by his uh his team's calculations that it would take seven years to get through the files in the current conditions established by the DOJ. So, you have</p>
<p>that going on, which basically allows the administration to say it's all out there, even though redactions were done apparently by just like blurring out any female's name, which is is certainly not how to do this when someone like Colleen Maxwell is such a central player in this, but she's over there saying, "Oh, I want clemency." And pleading the fifth to everything. And you're seeing the response of people coming out like Lauren Boowbert remember was really outfront about the Epstein files and that's where she was breaking with the Trump administration and then he personally called her asked her to pull back. She had been quieter. She's not</p>
<p>quiet anymore coming out of that room um saying that uh obviously she can't be granted any kind of clemency. Representative Paulina Luna uh said according to the files we saw, Galen Maxwell was engaged in trafficking and rape. I don't think she deserves special treatment. She's a monster. Um, so I think that if the administration was thinking that they could pull another move like what Todd Blanch did and getting her to that cushy prison because she quote unquote was going to exonerate</p>
<p><strong>[21:10]</strong></p>
<p>both Donald Trump and Bill Clinton because I guess they think that the two sides are as partisan dug in which I have not seen to be the case. Obviously, Bill Clinton, and I'm not alleging that either of them did anything with an underage girl, but you don't see liberals getting their back up against the wall in in a partisan crouch, right? They're just saying, "Let the chips fall where they may. Let's just find out what's going on here." But I hope that there's some world in which Maxwell is moved back to the bad prison and has to rot in there for the rest of her life. I</p>
<p>don't think you can trust a single word that comes out of her mouth. I think her testimony is meaningless at this point. Um, she committed psychological and physical torture on these girls. I don't know if I really mean this, but to some degree, the person who is recruiting and feeding these girls to Jeffrey Epstein almost feels worse in some way. And you know how I am about women that do things like this where I just think that there</p>
<p>is something built into us as the people who bring other people into the world that you should not be this depraved and sick. And I I think that if Trump is reading any tea leaves or Susie Wilds is, she knows that there can be no kind treatment for Galen Maxwell and that no one trusts anything that she says. >> Let's leave it there. We're going to take a quick break. Stay with us. Welcome back. Trump is proudly claiming we're already living in the Trump</p>
<p>economy. In an NBC interview that aired during the Super Bowl, he touted strong growth, foreign investment, and a boom fueled by AIdriven productivity while insisting that any economic problems are Biden's fault. >> Let's stay on the economy. You just mentioned it. You said you inherited a mess from President Biden when it comes to the economy. >> But at what point is it on you? At what point are we in the Trump economy? >> Oh, I'd say we're there now. I'm I'm very proud of it. 5.6 6%. You know, we have a GDP of 5.6 despite a shutdown. >> But the reality is more mixed. Most Americans disapprove of his handling of</p>
<p>the economy. Consumer sentiment is still low and some of his growth claims are inflated. As Trump rolls out this barnstorming economic message ahead of the midterms, the question is whether voters will buy it or if rising costs and skepticism about his numbers could undercut Republican prospects. What do you think Americans think about the Trump economy? >> They don't like it. Everybody doesn't like it. I mean, maybe the richest of the rich. Um, but when doesn't matter the survey, the pollster. I mean, this been an interesting week because</p>
<p>right-leaning polls have now moved squarely into negative territory about Trump. Um, Ras Mutant's pollster has been posting a lot on Twitter about how dangerous the territory is that they are now. Um, so his net approval is minus 18. Um, 26 points lower than it was in his first term. um 53 points lower with independence. Um</p>
<p><strong>[24:11]</strong></p>
<p>House and now Senate is widely talked about as being in play. We assume that about the House obviously um but Senate is a big deal. Tax Foundation just came out uh with their appraisal of the Trump tariffs. American households paid $1,000 more last year because of the tariffs. Um the Journal did an analysis that the American consumer is bearing up to 43% of the burden. So, yes, the corporations are taking some of the hit, but the average American is feeling it. Um, too, and there were great special election results for Democrats again, you know, 30 point plus overperformances in</p>
<p>Louisiana and Texas, right? Like this wasn't happening in deep blue territory. I think that people know what's up. What are your observations about the economy and how how people are reacting? >> Well, 36% of adults say they approve of his handling of the economy while 59% disapprove. That's according to NPR and the Maris PBS News survey. Um about three in 10 adults rate economic conditions in the country as excellent or good while roughly 7 and 10 rate them as only fair or poor. And 71% are concerned about the cost of health</p>
<p>care. 71% also say say the income gap between the richest and middle class in the US is increasing and consumer confidence is lowest since 2014. In addition, the genie coefficient which measures I guess variance and it's applied to wealth. Zero would be everyone has exactly the same. If one person owned everything that would be 100. When the French Revolution happened or the kind of you know let them eat cake era uh the genie coefficient was at</p>
<p>about uh somewhere between 80 and 85. Today in America the genie coefficient around around wealth is 83. We are literally at the point where revolutions happen. Uh the number of billionaires has surpassed 3,000 for the first time. It's higher the level of wealth is higher than any time in history. Meanwhile, one in four people globally face hunger. Billionaires are over 4,000 times more likely to hold political office. The one I like is that if you're a kid from a top 1% income</p>
<p>earning household, you're 77 times more likely to get into an elite university. What I don't get though is that the billionaires themselves seem to be handling their own PR really poorly. That they [ __ ] post America or they seem to think that, you know, they're just not they don't come across as really grateful or civic-minded is the way the ones that get the most press are the tech bros who credit their grit and character for their success and then blame the markets for anything that's</p>
<p>gone wrong or blame the country. Uh Trump families pocketed more than 1.8 billion in cash and gifts since the 2024 re-election. But for other things, as you pointed out, things have got or other people things have gotten better. Um tariffs show that only about 4% of the tariff burden is shouldered by foreign firms and that a near complete pass through of 96% to US buyers. folks, this notion</p>
<p><strong>[27:11]</strong></p>
<p>that the firm itself or the uh exporter uh shipping goods into the US would pay for tariffs. No, 96% of those tariffs are being passed on to American consumers. The other big winners have been Silicon Valley's tech titans. Musk spent at least 55 million on supporting conservative candidates last year and he accumulated roughly a quarter of a trillion dollars under Trump in terms of wealth growth. Yeah, it's pretty bleak. And I think that that's the reason that their PR has not been going well because I think those</p>
<p>stories are actually being covered and that people are very conscious of it. Even if Yeah. Well, they feel it. They feel what's going on in their pocket and then that the upper class is walking around like nothing happened. And I wanted to get your take on this. So John Oaf, who is a vulnerable Democratic senator in Georgia, he kind of appears every few months and does a great rally and reminds people um that he's awesome. Um but he's been talking about income inequality and going against the</p>
<p>billionaires and you know the corporate class, but he rolled out the Epstein class at his rally over the weekend. We were told that MAGA was for workingclass Americans. But this is a government of, by, and for the ultra rich. It is the wealthiest cabinet ever. This is the Epstein class ruling our country. They are the elites they pretend to hate. If you're Steve Bannon and your pitch,</p>
<p>>> your pitch was Trump for the forgotten man and woman, how do you sell any of this? Trump was supposed to fight for the working class. Instead, he's literally closing rural clinics and hospitals to cut taxes for George Soros and Elon Musk. >> So, he threw in the left-leaning billionaire right into all of this who puts a lot of money into those DA races across the country, etc. And I thought it was such smart framing, right, to make really putting this as us versus them and we're willing to sacrifice</p>
<p>Soros in pursuit of that. What do you make about the Epstein class as a term? Um, and then also, how do you think do you think Democrats are doing a decent job of seizing the moment or we're kind of still just like receiving results rather than going out and making them ourselves? Yeah, I think that I think I think it's brilliant and and the reason it's brilliant is that I think if Democrats try to say all men are violent, all white people are racist, and all billionaires are evil, well, don't be surprised if you know you're</p>
<p>stuck with very left-leaning female non-whites, which you cannot win an election with. Those people will leave you. The donors will leave you. They'll believe you, but you're saying I'm evil. I I thought Mark Benoff took way too much [ __ ] He said something off, you know, dumb in my view about San Francisco politics. The guy's been an incredible civic donor and there's this</p>
<p><strong>[30:12]</strong></p>
<p>notion that, okay, all billionaires are evil because we have some tech billionaires that just seem incredibly weird and ungrateful. So, I love the idea and not only that, I think Democrats should wrap their arms around successful people and people who make a lot of money. And what they need to do is all right, you've controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House for periods of time, and yet every time you're in there, you lower taxes on these people. So stop stop bitching about the officiating. You're wearing a black and white striped shirt. Figure out more progressive tax structure and stop demonizing</p>
<p>people who make a lot of money. Stop demonizing young men. Stop demonizing or having a bias against white people. I there that's just not a winning recipe for elections. What is brilliant about this is what he manages to do is say there is a virus in America amongst people who tend to be wealthy, tend to be white, tend to be male, not all of them, who believe they're not subject to the same standards as everybody else, and believe they can get away with anything and believe they're</p>
<p>entitled to a level of depravity that no one else would would dare uh take these sorts of risk. and he's classified them as the Epstein class, which I think is brilliant cuz what it's saying is no, not not every rich white guy is a pedophile. I get that. But there is amongst this this group of people an Epstein class. So I think it's brilliant positioning because what it does is it doesn't alienate the Howard Schultz's of the world. you know, the it doesn't alienate</p>
<p>wealthy white guys who have traditionally been supporters of the Democratic party who at some point are like, you know, I I'm sick of trying to be your ally and you want to hang me at Dawn because I'm pointing the gun incorrectly. So, I think it's I think it's brilliant positioning. He's been very good. He's very vottoenic. Uh I'm going to give him some money just you bring it up. I like him. I hope >> he's had the before and afters. really fun discourse online about his glow up.</p>
<p>>> We had a glow up. >> He definitely lifted some weights and uh his hair's a bit different. I mean, >> he looks good. >> Yeah. >> Is his race close? I haven't been following it. >> It is. I think it's now at lean D when it was more tops, but they're not fielding a great situation on the right against him. I mean, it's it's just incredible that we have Waro and Oaf, frankly. >> Yeah. Especially in Georgia. Yeah. Fingers crossed, right? Okay. Yep. >> Let's take a quick break. Stay with us. >> Welcome back. Before we go, private</p>
<p>school tuition in New York City has officially crossed jaw-dropping territory. Several elite schools are now charging more than $70,000 a year, more than many top colleges, as families flee a struggling public system embraced from major changes under the new mayor. For some parents, it's sticker shock. For others, it's the price of peace of mind. Jess, this is something we both deal with. This is a story of privilege. >> This is why I submitted it to David. I</p>
<p><strong>[33:13]</strong></p>
<p>was like, Scott's going to want to talk about this. >> But what do I I got a I got I got a lot to say about this or a lot of thoughts. >> You go first. I always go first. I want to hear you first. >> Well, I think Okay, so I'm going through this right now on both levels. My son just applied to college. They have this total racket called early decision where you say this is my top choice and they say rather than a 9% admissions rate we'll bump it up to 15% in exchange for the following. If we let you in, you withdraw all applications from every other college. They immediately get</p>
<p>withdrawn. Now what does that do? Okay, in exchange for us saying to you greater chance of getting in, you lose all negotiating all all leverage for financial aid. So in a desperate move to please your parents, please yourself, go to a good school where they artificially sequester supply, not all schools, but most most of the top schools such that they can raise rates faster than inflation. We're going to enter into this corrupt cartel-like system of saying you can get a better chance of getting in, but once you're in, no leverage. Syracuse</p>
<p>couldn't fill their class. And so they started offering scholarships. And the people who got an early decision said, "Where are scholarships?" and they said, "Sorry, you're [ __ ] You've committed to go here." So, there is all sorts of griff going on here. Now, with respect to K through 12, the reason I left New York is because my son got shut out of seven schools because he was speech delayed. You know, the story ends well. Just got into an elite school. But that was really upsetting that no one would let us in, our son in, our four-year-old into a school and let us pay them</p>
<p>$58,000 to play with blocks. And they artificially against sequester supply. And the math I did is that I think every private school should be required to say the following. All right. Say you're right and you your kid you decide to send your kid to the public school. By the way, there's a lot of research showing the best school for your kid is the closest public or private and reinvest that commute time back into study, sleep, play, time with parents. But let's say you send them to their local public school and you were wrong.</p>
<p>They don't get as good an education. And to be clear, the average public school in America spends $15,000. The average private school 75. So over the course of 12 years, $720,000 funneled through an education system is going to pay off for your kids, as evidenced by the SAT, where lower income kids score 150 points less than middle- inome kids. And then hold your hats. Upper income kids score 250 points higher than middle class kids because for 12 years they've had another $60,000 in education, tutoring, counseling. uh you know, athletics</p>
<p>invested in them. You have this situation where okay, everyone there's a massive overinvestment. Say you took that $50,000 or that I'm sorry, now it's $70,000. If you took that $70,000 and you were disciplined and you sent it to Vanguard every year and sent them to the local public schools, say you [ __ ] up. They don't get into an elite school. They don't get into an elite college.</p>
<p><strong>[36:14]</strong></p>
<p>Okay, people will say elite college doesn't matter. Yeah, it does, folks. I hate to break it to you. It does. And any parent telling you college doesn't matter anymore just found out their little Susie got a 22 on the ACT and is trying to make himself feel better. But say fine, okay, we put that $72,000 a year aside. The kid doesn't get into an elite school, doesn't get out of the gate strong, can't get a house. We [ __ ] up sending them to public school. If you had taken that $72,000 and over 12 years were disciplined about putting it in an index fund and the market went up 9% which it has since the beginning</p>
<p>of the market at 35 you can ease your guilt and your kids pain by giving them $4.5 million. So, it is very hard to argue that if you were to be disciplined and to take that money that you would spend on private school, especially in New York, and put it into index funds, you're going to be able to buy back a lot of potential mistakes and economic harm for that kid. Now, there are other reasons to send them to that school. And also, just so I can get the progressives angry, there needs to be more accountability from public school officials because New York</p>
<p>is not short on money spent per child. It's short on positive outcomes. it just we continue to have kids who are not doing well even despite the fact we spend more than a lot of places do. So the the sequestering of the 1% who have their own transportation, their own security, their own neighborhoods, their own education, their own health care creates a situation where the most powerful and some of the most talented among us are no longer invested in</p>
<p>America. And the number one indicator of a strong school in terms of outcomes isn't money, isn't isn't the kids, it's how engaged the parents are. And I saw this happen. I went to junior high in the 70s. In my seventh grade, you know, me and all my friends were there. And then in the eighth grade, they started busing. And all of a sudden, overnight, 40% of our class, a thousand kids, literally a thousand kids from Compton, black kids were bust in an hour each way. you know, in a bad [ __ ] mood</p>
<p>when they got there. And I wish it had been a Hallmark commercial. We hated each other. It was violent. It was ugly. We used to have black against white softball games and the faculty allowed that. >> That's the bad news. The good news is by the time we got to high school, we were all getting along. So, integration did pay off. And I actually think it's one of the reasons I have more empathy for people. My two closest friends was a Mormon kid who went to Stanford and a black kid who had to get a football scholarship to get to a school in Oregon. Immediately in the eighth grade,</p>
<p>my two best friends, Adam and David, their parents pulled them out and sent them to Winward, this Tony school. And I had one of those talks with my mom. So I'm like, "Mom, I need to go to Winward. All my friends are going there." And she's like, "No, we're I had one of those word different talks." >> Yeah. But the the wealthy the school system is yet another means of enforcing the cast system. And the only solution I</p>
<p><strong>[39:15]</strong></p>
<p>can come up with is to take that $70,000 price tag and make it a h 100,000 >> and redistribute that income back into public schools with distinctly harsher standards on teachers, administrators, and unions that if you don't get your scores up, it's going to a charter school and we're firing all of you. Uh but something needs to happen here. It's become the new enforcer, the cast system. Anyways, that's my TED talk. >> I agree with everything that you said and most happy, I guess, to hear that the marker of the best school for your child is proximity because we're opting</p>
<p>to send our oldest will go to public school next year. She'll start kindergarten. And it was a very hard decision for us to make because she has a December birthday. And inexplicably, the New York City public school system just puts all the kids who are born in the same year in the class. So, she'll >> Oh, so she'll be one of the youngest. It's not as bad for girls as it is for boys. There's I'm sorry to interrupt you, but there's research that shows the youngest boys in a class are more likely to be depressed because they're smaller</p>
<p>and they get picked on. But the same data is not as evident with girls who are the youngest in their class. >> Okay. Well, that's good news. And she's very tall. Uh she she has good tall jeans. Um, but so we're opting to do that. And as a New York City private school graduate, I had a lot of feelings about what kind of educational opportunities I was giving my child versus the ones that I was afforded. And this chart about the tuition costs really popped out at me cuz the school that I went to for high school was on it, place called the Dalton School. It was $35,000 when I went. It's $70,000</p>
<p>now. And I look at the world, right? I'm I'm out here functioning. I work with people who are paid tremendous amounts of money. My husband works in finance. He went to public school. A lot of his friends have huge jobs, right? Like leading big divisions at financial institutions who the people that I went to school with report to them, right? And these are your average good public school, but just, you know, normal thing that a</p>
<p>parents that parents move to a certain place because they have a great school and they want their kids >> state. Yeah. >> Yeah. And they're they're not just fine. In most cases, I find that they're better human beings. A lot of them are more successful, but I've been much more focused on the quality of human than the level of academic achievement necessarily because I've just met so many and grew up with so many people who I don't want to be the folks surrounding my kids. And we'll see what happens. I I</p>
<p>hope that the school is fantastic for her and at some point we will end up in the private school system, but you look at that price tag and going back to what you were just saying about the genie coefficient for the US. It's just wrong at a certain age. >> But especially at that age, they're playing >> for five. Yes, I get it. And most of these schools go through the really good ones in New York City at least, they go through fifth grade and then most kids filter into the private school system</p>
<p><strong>[42:15]</strong></p>
<p>and they're set up for success with that. But the system needs to be smashed because you say, you know, take that 70k and invest it. A lot of for most people, they don't have the 70k, right? Or that they would be taking out loans to be able to do this and putting themselves into debt. But there has to be a real reckoning. And this goes back to the Epstein class, you know, formulation, right? Where you just say it shouldn't be this way. And a majority of people who are doing this, and this is happening in cities all across the country, it's not just New York City. It's because their parents have</p>
<p>generational wealth that they can help them. Can't even tell you how many people I know that are like, "Well, we're not paying for it, right? This is money that was set aside by grandparents." And it's creating this false sense of uh financial security and ego for these kids who are walking around like they're all, you know, like too big for their britches. We're saying, "Yeah, your granddad founded X, Y, or Z thing, right? or your your grandparents came from or your great-grandparents this incredible immigrant class and was able to pass</p>
<p>down this wealth so you could go to this school, but what are you going to make of it? Of course, people at the top, they're going to go to the Harvards and the Yales of the world, but there are plenty of kids are going to go to just average schools, right, colleges out of this. And then I'm thinking, you know, you spent hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars for them to probably not have as good of a or as fun certainly or well-rounded experience while they were in school. and they ended up at exactly the same place with no guarantee that they're going to have a better job when they're coming out of it. Um, so all for a meritocracy in this</p>
<p>of smashing the system that allows schools to be $70,000 a year and and hearing about also, you know, school just doesn't feel like it should be for profit. I I just I hate that, especially going down to the dirty secrets. The dirty secret is the nonprofits are four prophets wrapped in a sheep's clothing. >> So now you've just ruined everything for me. >> There's 16 administrators for every one person that teaches at MIT. I can tell you my colleagues are obsessed with artificial scarcity and means of every</p>
<p>every morning, not everyone, but the majority of administrators, the majority of faculty members are capitalists like everywhere else. And they wake up in the morning and they say, "How do I increase my compensation while reducing my accountability?" and they wrap themselves in nobility and raise tuition faster than inflation every year. When I I went to public school all the way through graduate school and seven years of tuition of undergrad at UCLA and graduate school at Berkeley, the total tuition was $7,000. And the UC system is still doing God's work. Yeah.</p>
<p>>> Still exceptional value. Probably the one of the best actors in the space. And now that would be aboutund the tuition for seven years would be $120,000. Now 7 to 120 even as old as I am has vastly outpaced inflation. I mean it's a longer conversation but a lot of it comes back to cheap credit governmentbacked student loans accreditation that won't let competition</p>
<p><strong>[45:17]</strong></p>
<p>in. And also they in my view we need to revoke the taxfree status of any university whether it's Dartmouth or Harvard that has an endowment over a billion dollars that's not growing its freshman class faster than population growth because they've decided they're a hedge fund offering classes no longer a public servant. But we fall under the illusion that me and my colleagues are like nice, noble, good people. No, we're capitalists like everyone else. And unless we're regulated, we're going to [ __ ] the middle class. And that is exactly what we've been doing for the last 40 years. >> Thanks a lot, Scott. >> There you go. All right, Jess, that's</p>

      <title>Ghislaine Maxwell’s Testimony is “Meaningless”</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xcVrlg5rY1o</link>
      <description>New revelations in the Epstein files might complicate Ghislaine Maxwell’s bid for clemency. Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov discuss, on Raging Moderates.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>You know
how I am about women that do things
like this. Let's talk about
ghislaine maxwell. Where do you think her case goes
from here? I don't think
anywhere that she wants
it to. Representative
Paulina Luna said, “according
to the files we saw, ghislaine maxwell 
was engaged in traffic
and rape. I don't think
she deserves special treatment. She's a monster.” I hope that there is
some world in which Maxwell
is moved back to the bad
prison, and has to rot
in there for the rest of her
life. I don't think you can trust a single word that comes out of her mouth. I think her testimony
is meaningless. She committed
psychological</p>
<p>and physical torture on these girls. I don't know if I
really mean this, but to some degree, the person who is recruiting
and feeding these girls
to Jeffrey Epstein almost feels worse. You know how I am
about women that do things like this, where I just think that there is something built into us
as the people who bring other people
into the world, that you should not
be this depraved and sick. And I think that
if Trump is reading any tea leaves
or Susie Wiles is,</p>
<p>she knows that there can be no kind treatment for
ghislaine maxwell, and that no one
trusts anything
that she says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Trump has become “Ineffective”</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cPt1dcq58Q8</link>
      <description>Whether he’s posting racist videos, or blaming it on the media, Trump’s old playbook isn’t hitting the same marks anymore. Jessica Tarlov and Scott Galloway discuss, on Raging Moderates.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>The is being called a bit more. >> Over the weekend, President Trump was doing what he's done for years, picking cultural fights. He went after an Olympic skier for expressing mixed feelings about representing the US. I think that skier probably represents most of us right now. Amplified a racist video depicting the Obamas and once again leaned into grievance and division. >> What really stood out to me is how ineffective I feel like he's become. Like he's really lost his fastball. I think they call it the weave that he does, right? where he like finds a way to get a question that he doesn't like and then he goes some other path and</p>
<p>somehow his base plus the extra 10% that voted for him understands what he really meant and all is forgiven and it doesn't really feel like that's happening anymore at least when it comes to these culture war things and on the horrible racist video of the Obamas depicting them as apes that came out Laura Ingram had Caroline Levit on and asked her about it said can you really throw a staffer under the bus and Levit tried this. Oh well, this is a leftist media narrative and she's staring at Laura Ingram. So, it feels like the</p>
<p>is being called a bit more. I'm not predicting some downfall of the Trump administration, but it does feel like he is not hitting his marks in the same way. And he's not able to dangle one trans swimmer in front of people to get them to come over to his side. and that people are actually observing what's going on on the ground and formulating a not so positive view of Trump and co as a result.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Epstein Scandal TURNS on Trump as Howard Lutnick Gets Caught LYING</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPlEda_BRHg</link>
      <description>Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov sit down with Yale leadership scholar Jeff Sonnenfeld to unpack his new book, Trump’s Ten Commandments. They dive into Trump’s racist stunts like posting the recent AI Obama video to his “tribal chieftain” style of centralizing power. Jeff breaks down how Trump bends rules, gets things done outside traditional channels, and uses distraction and propaganda to shift the public's focus. 

Prof G also talks with Prof Sonnenfeld about the Resist and Unsubscribe Movement, and what other things that business leaders can do right now to spark collective action.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:04]</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Raging Moderates. I'm Scott Galloway >> and I'm Jessica Tarlov. >> We're joined today by Jeffrey Sonninfeld, a longtime Yale leadership scholar and one of Trump's most consistent public critics who has written a new book called Trump's Ten Commandments, also a role model of mine. Jeff is an academic who decided he wanted to have a lot of impact outside of the four walls of his home institution Yale and has just a big footprint and hosts these kind of agoras of uh CEOs and in this moment his voice has never been louder and more resonant.</p>
<p>Uh anyways Jeff thanks very much uh thanks so much for joining us today. >> Uh Scott Jesse it's an honor to to rejoin you. Thank you very much. And talking about having an impact to be on the walls of academia, I can't think of any better role model than you. >> Oh, you guys are adorable. There we go. >> We'll fight. We'll still fight, but about a fellow raging moderate. >> There you go. >> It's a good club. >> Let's bust right into it. Last week, Trump posted a racist AI generated video</p>
<p>of Barack and Michelle Obama. How does this kind of provocation fit into the patterns you identify in Trump's Ten Commandments, your new book? >> Well, thanks so much. And we talk about in there is as various elements such as divide and conquer, as you know, in terms of how he divides uh business communities and and and influential uh institutions uh so that they can be subject to different tyades of v vindictiveness. Uh, and there's a little bit of that at play here, but in</p>
<p>particular, we have a chapter in there called the wall of sound that u that Scott, even you are perhaps too young to remember, but I bet you do. As the Phil Spectre, very controversial uh bad guy record producer who uh uh was known for having so many instruments blaring at once in this the same note, same harmony, is that it's a it's a a kind of a a distraction device that Trump has. Some people call it the the shiny object. Uh some people will uh you know call it the wag the tail and and</p>
<p>and applying it to Venezuela, but it's a way of uh of distracting no doubt about it that this is bigoted, hostile and racially offensive to put it mildly. Uh th those cartoons were not some subtle dog whistle. It was screaming racial uh venom at at the top of lungs. However, wherever he comes out on racial issues, he's using it strategically. Even though it comes out angry as as a midnight post, which supposedly some other staffer was on his Truth Social account</p>
<p>at the exact second at midnight, but nonetheless, people think wrongly that these are impulsive decisions, these are uh deliberate strategic devices. The Venezuela attack, however you feel about drug trafficking, the idea of Chinese and Russian ships surrounding Venezuela, that didn't work. and blaming the oil industry execs when they to a person told me they had nothing to do with it, no interest in it. Is that he just, you</p>
<p><strong>[03:05]</strong></p>
<p>know, looking for ways to change the subject off of Epstein, affordability, healthc care issues, uh that he tried the Venezuela of Greenland the week after that. There's nothing particularly ownorous or threatening that we had to go in to start to threaten the possible military and economic sanctions for Greenland. uh the the the seizing these um election ballots uh out of South Falton County. These are desperate efforts to change the subject from domestic largely domestic issues he doesn't want to talk about and using race is always a last resort of</p>
<p>scoundrels and he's not above that. >> Before I just toss it to Jess, I'd love to know based on your book and your research here, how do we of the ten commandments of Trump, how do we break the tablets? I think a lot of us are frustrated at what is seen as fairly anemic push back by Democrats or a lot of us are just frustrated like what do I do? Do you have any thoughts on what the most effective push back and the format and the mediums and the message? >> I'm so glad Jesse if we take the next</p>
<p>two hours to talk about that great question. It's a big one. >> I'm in it to win it. You guys go. That's the essence here is u we have these these 10 issues that everything all the power centralized through him. He uses a sleeper effect which is a a propaganda device that was actually studied here at Yale we're sorry to say in the 40s and 50s trying to learn from what uh the third Reich was doing in the 30s is repeating false information repeat over and over. There's a lot of devices in there that you would recognize as manipulative mass communications tools</p>
<p>and strategy devices. The most important thing is though what you asked which is instead of labeling him as as an autocrat as as a demagogue or as a as a psychotic sociopath or all the different labels that different disciplines throw out there which which however accurate they may or may not be they don't tell us what to do and how to respond to it. It's like you don't you don't make any progress calling an alcoholic a drunk. >> Getting past the fingerpointing and trying to figure out what we do about it. It's collective action. That's how you take down a bully. Uh we have seen</p>
<p>it happen successfully in August of 2017 after the tragic killing of an innocent young woman peaceful protester in Charlottesville in August 2017. Uh Trump went on the air that was a Friday night on the air Saturday and made a a very underwhelming statement of sympathy and then somebody whomever Steven Miller I don't know advised him to go back into it again the next day Sunday and came out with the equivocation of the white nationalist who murdered this woman being you know good on both sides with the quivocation statement that led Ken</p>
<p>Fraser of MC one of four black CEOs leading a Fortune 500 firm at the time to say I've had it I'm out and he told his board you do what you want I can't speak for MC I'm speaking for me and the board fortunately backed is there's a slight delay the next day and we started calling through to all different offices of corporate America and that led to a mass exodus a stampede left the business advisory councils to this day the business roundt never made a statement on this but that was a</p>
<p><strong>[06:07]</strong></p>
<p>grassroots exit that made a huge difference they walked away from Trump and they didn't come back until in 2021 and January uh there's other than Elon Musk there's no support in the US business community on the trade front we saw the national association of manufacturers It was a pretty much arc right-wing group that was not interested in civil rights issues, wasn't interested in the Vietnam War, wasn't interested in environmental concerns, and that's why the business roundt was formed as a reaction to them of all things that that showed collective action. Uh, believe it or not, we actually unified 700 college and</p>
<p>university presidents to take a stand midappril last spring after Harvard and Colombia and other schools were being sequentially attacked. We saw the anemic response of law firms and thought, well, can't university world do better. Despite the the nonsense uh the BS of these institutional neutrality statements, these college presidents, university presidents uh overrode their own boards of trustees and came out with a very strong collective set of statements and those edicts stopped. So, it's collective action that does it. But</p>
<p>it can't just be the CEOs. I asked the CEOs, why aren't we hearing from more of you? and they say, "Where are the clergy?" Until Minneapolis, if your life depended on it, you couldn't name me five clergy, interfaith clergy, linking arms the way they did in the 60s and 70s to take a stand. Even now, with the exception of Minneapolis, we don't see the trade unions speaking out. We don't see the professional associations and and again, we talk about the campuses. Uh these voices which were very important in the 60s to be across sectors are somewhat muted now. Jos >> um I that was all really interesting and</p>
<p>now I have many directions that I want to go in but I I want to go back to something that you said in your first answer and you mentioned Epstein which is the kind of topic dour right now and as we're recording this commerce secretary Howard Lutnik is testifying um before the Senate uh he had a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein he claimed publicly that he didn't talk to him after 2005 Senator Van Holland kind of has him dead to rights on that and I want to play this clip and then get your response as to what you think Trump's leadership style at this moment is going</p>
<p>to lead him to do. So, let's look at that. I >> I think you understand the root of concern here. It's the way you described very emphatically your first encounter with him in his apartment, said you were disgusted, would never have any contact with him again. Did you in fact make the visit to Jeffrey Epstein's private island? >> I did have lunch with him as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation.</p>
<p>My wife was with me as were my four children and nannies. I had another couple with they were there as well with their children and we had lunch on the island. That is true for an hour and we left with all of my children with my nannies and my wife all together. We</p>
<p><strong>[09:08]</strong></p>
<p>were on family vacation. We were not apart to suggest there was anything unoured about that in 2012. I don't I don't recall why we did it. But >> Mr. Secretary, again, >> so I just want to note this is after Jeffrey Abstein is a registered sex offender. Letic said that he didn't interface with him after 2005. Based upon what you know about Trump's view and his leadership style, how do you think that he's going to handle having a cabinet secretary caught in this kind of lie and the attention that it brings to</p>
<p>the administration? >> Well, Trump doesn't ever apologize as we see with the racial situation. And we had somebody uh Trent Lot, if anybody remembers that name, who was the Senate majority leader, Republican Senate Majority Leader, made a a quote unquote off-color joke back in I don't think 2004 or so, saying that um if only STM Thurman had won in 1948 for president. That was enough to force his resignation. We saw people such as Wilbur Mills, the chairman of the Ways</p>
<p>and Means Committee on a indiscretion doesn't compare to these things or u or Dennis Hasser, N Gingrich, uh the Bob Livingston, former Republican speakers of the House all had to resign for things. There was shame not that long ago. We saw shame still matter and and what's happened here is atrocious. There's we have a chapter in there on on how he moves away from losers. uh that he's decided that Giuliani and whomever else uh uh Sarah Palin are too much of a liability for him. He me he doesn't have a a two-way loyalty. He doesn't mind</p>
<p>cutting things off. The challenge here, which is such a good question, Jesse, is we would predict from that chapter that he would drop Lutnik. I mean, a lot of CEOs tell us after they shake hands with Howard Lutnik, now they want to wash their hands. I mean, obviously they feel soiled. This guy's reputation is in the sewer. He has overtly lied. You know, on that clip you showed, it doesn't demonstrate whether or not he actually perjured himself under oath, but we do know that he said repeatedly in recently to the media that, as you pointed out, was 2005, he had no more contact with</p>
<p>that disgusting person. And now we see that he not only built a house next door to him, uh, but he was investing in businesses for years later. He he stayed in contact for 12 years past. He told us he'd stopped all contact. and apparent if you take a look at the emails suggesting there was a trip to the island. We don't actually see the trip. We see the before and after. I don't know. But is that if he takes the move on Lutnik and pushes him out, which he should, does that start the quote unquote proverbial slippery slope where all the indiscretions of Hegsth and and</p>
<p>others start to spiral out of control? I think it's possible that um he could lose Lutnik. Lutnik is not popular on the cabinet. Obviously, this would make Secretary of Treasury Scott Besson's day to get rid of Lutnik and maybe take Bill Py with him. >> I was going to say I think he wants PY out out too. >> Yeah, they'd like to send those guys back to the bowling alley. I mean, this</p>
<p><strong>[12:08]</strong></p>
<p>is a lot of CEOs say Howard Lutnik is the Fred Flintstone of finance and and that these days would be a compliment. He's bringing nothing but shame. But the thing is with Trump himself with 38,000 redacted mentions uh in this report, how does he stop it from spreading? It's a great question. We would predict that he'd figure out a way of getting Lutnik out of there. U but u he will first try for a while the denial just like he said just a few months ago that this is a Democratic hoax. There's nothing to the</p>
<p>Epstein files after on the campaign trail saying this is the this is the answer to the Democrats uh pedophilia uh fraud. >> Yeah, I should check Poly Market for the odds that we strike Iran tonight because I know that's usually the go-to distraction. Um >> you're exactly right. It's something like that. Maybe they they need to to worry about this in in in Montaco or Likensstein or or Luxembourg, you know, or some other area of great concern to Donald Trump that he'll raid to distract us as a major concern or what blue city he's going to come after.</p>
<p>>> Well, I want to just say what you said about a shameless administration is so important and run by a man who doesn't feel shame. So, as regular people on the ground trying to navigate this, how do you think the American people, and this links obviously to what Scott is doing with uh people unsubscribing from these services, companies that don't seem to be taking a stand at anything against the administration, but how do you think that we can create an environment where some sense of shame comes back to our</p>
<p>elected officials? Obviously, winning elections is part of that. Um, but in the day-to-day, >> well, uh, here's the challenge is people watching CNN or MS Now or reading The Atlantic and trottling to themselves, "This guy's such a loser. He's so stupid." U, just because Trump uh, often appears uh, convincingly ignorant doesn't mean he's stupid. He's dumb as a fox. He has incredible street savvy. people who keep predicting his demise ever since, you know, he attacked the</p>
<p>Pope and and John McCain and and people who are PSWs that he considered losers. All these third rails that he's taken on and survived, uh they need to recognize that it's going to take something more. The collective action is important part. Uh but we also saw that uh this disengagement that Scott talks about is part of an even larger spirit of voice. When I talk to CEOs about taking a stand right now, they're afraid. You know, he</p>
<p>look who he's attacked. He's attacked Jamie Diamond, the most feared and revered finance in the world, the CEO of JP Morgan. Uh he's attacked Brian Moyahan of Bank of America. He's he's attacked David Solomon at Goldman Sachs, stepping away from finance. He's a attacked Coca-Cola. What could that Coke is the most universal expression uh globally as Scott knows as a great marketer? Then the expression okay is expression Coke. He's taken on</p>
<p><strong>[15:08]</strong></p>
<p>Coca-Cola. He's taken on Delta Airlines. He's taken on um Harley-Davidson. Harley, what could be a more iconic American brand? That their very mascot is uh the symbol is is the u is the bald eagle. Their customers, the riders lead slightly MAGA. their workforce slightly anti-MAGA. The CEO just tries to pilot it down the center of the road because of reciprocal trade barriers from Europe against Trump. Harley had to shut down its plant because all of its bikes were made in in not just North America, made</p>
<p>in the US. They had to shut down a plant in Kansas City, open one in Thailand. Trump took that as a personal offense and said, "Don't buy Harley the stock plumber." They fired the CEO, Matt Levitage. Check it out. So, you know, that's a cautionary tale to CEOs. You can't act alone. But like Ken Frasier did is you can stimulate, you can spark as uh the last line in in in Ipsson's great play enemy the people is the strongest person in the world. He actually said the strongest man but he meant the strongest person in the world is the person who can stand alone is somebody who can set a model. We need</p>
<p>that but we also need that collective action. What else do we need? The CEOs who want to do something say you know we're not oligarchs. only three to five percent are the people that that Scott was one of the first to go after in terms of this oligarchic control of tech titans is 97 98% of them are hired hands they're salaried employees some of them overly salaried you know maybe some too well paid but still they they say we have to respond to constituents but who do they hear from they hear from red state treasurers they hear from red state attorneys general saying our</p>
<p>pensioners money in our state we want you to either be silent or be you know mildly somewhat pro MAGA the where the blue state attorneys general have been weirdly quiet quiet not to mention as we mentioned the clergy everybody else so we need to have that kind of pressure and as Scott talks about and Jesse was just echoing the consumer boycotts are just one part there's a lot of pressure that goes on whether or not because oddly enough a lot of consumer goods companies are not always the first to move these days but they do feel the sensitivity of public pressure so going after consumer goods companies matters a</p>
<p>lot >> jeeoff you know this you're a role model of mine we share a lot we're both academics we both want to have and enjoy having impact outside of the classroom. were both Jews. And I don't know, I I see a lot of parallels not with Nazi Germany, but with late stage Weimar Republic Germany that I find very alarming what's going on in the US right now. And where I I don't agree, I don't think Trump gives a about the clergy or unions who he listens to are</p>
<p>the people that you convene at a greater scale and density than anyone in the world. I've been to your CEO events. You bring together more powerful CEOs in a room than anyone in the world. I think more than Davos in terms of concentration of CEOs of Fortune 500. And I'm empathetic to the notion that nobody wants to go first because if you</p>
<p><strong>[18:08]</strong></p>
<p>go first, a good autocrat smacks you back. You do have an obligation to your shareholders. So, everyone is reticent to go first. I get that. What we need is someone at the center of these Fortune 500 CEOs who convinces them to take collective action. I can't think of anyone who is more ripe, capable, and well positioned to be that leader than you. What do we need to do? What is required to help Jeffrey Sonnenfeld get 10, 50, 100 of the Fortune 500 cos,</p>
<p>the people that the president listens to? He's only backed away from threats to annex Greenland or tariffs when he hears from the markets or CEOs. You're their Yoda. You're their whisperer. What is it going to take for Jeffrey Sonnenfeld to get collective action from Fortune 500 CEOs? >> Scott, we have done it repeatedly. uh for example uh the the 2020 elections that Trump says were fraudulent. was the absentee ballots leaned heavily uh</p>
<p>towards Biden whereas in in person polling was leaning towards Trump and that's because the people who believed in science were less likely to go uh to the polling places because of co at the time uh count after count 64 court decisions endless audits and recounts and things and we convened the top 100 CEOs on 12 hours notice to come out with a a stand congratulating the winners to demand a speedy transfer of hour. Uh that made a big difference on the roll backs in 17 states on these crazy voting</p>
<p>rights restrictions. We brought them together repeatedly. So three or four times we we brought these CEOs together when it when it really mattered. They will. But they also hear from their constituents. You're right. Trump doesn't care what the clergy have to say or he wouldn't have made such a fool of himself at the national prayer breakfast on Friday. But he but those CEOs care what the clergy. They care what the trade unions. They care what the investors, what the community activists, what the campus voices, they care about all these stakeholders. It was just five, six years ago they're talking about stakeholder capitalism. Well,</p>
<p>where are those stakeholders? They're sitting home eating their steak, watching TV and chroling expecting Trump's imminent demise, and they're wrong. They have to speak out. Then the CEOs will respond. CEOs just can't say, "Well, it's my patriotism, my personal values, my ethics." No. Unless they're one of those handful of oligarchs, they're a custodian of other people's resources. they need to hear from those other people. As um Toqueville said when he came to the country in 1840, he wrote democracy in America, a French jurist. He wondered why do our laws work. He said it's not because of the tightness of the laws. It's the looseness of the</p>
<p>laws. They adapt the circumstances, but for them to work, what Toqueville said, it involves trust in the community. That means business leaders, he specified business leaders and other leaders of the community have to certify the truth. Toqueeville called it social capital. People think that's a newly invented term. Toefield coined it in 1840 and he said social capital is as important as financial capital. These people are the</p>
<p><strong>[21:09]</strong></p>
<p>pillars. They are the most respected. Sadly, legislators, federal, state, local, the media, academia, clergy have all lost standing in American society. Business leaders are still ascendant. My CEO in the Alamman trust surveys just last week and do still the strongest, most trusted voice as my CEO. We do need to hear from them. We have to give them license to speak for us speaking up and telling them to speak. They work for us. Tell them so. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is a longtime Yale leadership scholar who has written a new book called Trump's Ten Commandments and</p>
<p>I would propose is the leader we need right now. Uh, Professor Sonnenfeld was really happy to hear from you and appreciate your time. Well, >> thank you very much, folks. Thanks, Jesse. Thanks, Scott. >> Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Trump Tariffs Cost U.S. Families $1,000</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjmPZJ0JlXU</link>
      <description>With wealth inequality hitting French Revolution levels, the U.S. economy may be at its breaking point. Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov discuss, on Raging Moderates.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>What do you think Americans think about the Trump economy? >> They don't like it. Everybody doesn't like it. I mean, maybe the richest of the rich. Doesn't matter the survey, the pollster. Tax Foundation just came out uh with their appraisal of the Trump tariffs. American households paid $1,000 more last year because of the tariffs. I think that people know what's up. >> According to NPR and the Maris PBS News survey, 71% say the income gap between the richest and middle class in the US is increasing. In addition, the genie coefficient which measures I guess variance and it's applied to wealth.</p>
<p>Everyone has the same would be zero. If one person owned everything, that'd be 100. When the French Revolution happened, the genie coefficient was somewhere between 80 and 85. Today in America, the genie coefficient around wealth is 83. We are literally at the point where revolutions happen. >> It's pretty bleak.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>“I hate to break it to you”, but elite colleges matter.</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/32X3nD3fLYw</link>
      <description>Private school tuition is hitting record highs. Is it worth it Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov discuss, on Raging Moderates.
#politics #podcast #economy</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Private school tuition in New York City has officially crossed jaw-dropping territory. Several elite schools are now charging more than $70,000 a year, more than many top colleges as families flee a struggling public system embraced from major changes under the new mayor. By the way, there's a lot of research showing the best school for your kid is the closest, public or private, and reinvest that commute time back into study, sleep, play, time with parents. But let's say you send them to their local public school and you were wrong. They don't get as good an education. And to be clear, the average public school in America spends $15,000. The average private school 75. So over the course of</p>
<p>12 years, $720,000 funneled through an education system. It's going to pay off for your kids as evidenced by the SAT where lower income kids score 150 points less than middle- inome kids. And then hold your hats. Upper income kids score 250 points higher than middle class kids because for 12 years they've had another $60,000 in education, tutoring, counseling. If you took that $70,000 and you were disciplined and you sent it to Vanguard every year and send them to the local public schools, say you [ __ ] up. They don't get into an elite school. They don't get into an elite college.</p>
<p>Okay, people will say elite college doesn't matter. Yeah, it does, folks. I hate to break it to you, it does. And any parent telling you college doesn't matter anymore just found out their little Susie got a 22 on the ACT and is trying to make himself feel better. But say, fine. Okay, we put that $72,000 a year aside. The kid doesn't get into an elite school, doesn't get out of the gate strong, can't get a house. We [ __ ] up sending them to public school. If you had taken that $72,000 and over 12 years were disciplined about putting it in an index fund and the market went</p>
<p>up 9% at 35, you can ease your guilt and your kids' pain by giving them $4.5 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Pam Bondi IMPLODES Over Epstein Bombshell as Shutdown LOOMS</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kds492UqO3I</link>
      <description>Immigration enforcement suddenly halts in Minneapolis as Democrats push to disrupt ICE funding and shut down DHS unless major reforms happen. At the same time, Pam Bondi’s House hearing turns into a four-hour Epstein showdown — with survivors in the room and Democrats accusing the DOJ of stonewalling. Jessica Tarlov and Aaron Parnas (@aaronparnas1) break down whether Bondi just handed the opposition a powerful midterm talking point. Cracks are also forming inside the GOP. House Republicans defy Trump on tariffs, triggering primary threats and raising a bigger question: is the party truly starting to break ranks — or is this just symbolic rebellion? And with 130,000 jobs added in January and unemployment ticking down to 4.3%, is the labor market shaking off the trade war drama? Plus: RFK Jr.’s pivot from vaccine skepticism to “healthy eating,” Pelosi’s endorsement of Jack Schlossberg, Prince Andrew’s reported settlement money, and an Olympic controversy that has everyone talking.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:04]</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Raging Moderates. I'm Jessica Tarliff. >> And I'm Aaron Parnes. >> And in today's episode, we're discussing Pam Bondi's disastrous testimony, cracks in the GOP's support for tariffs, and the end of immigration enforcement in Minneapolis. If you aren't already, please make sure to subscribe to our YouTube page to get up-to-date coverage. All right, Aaron, let's get into it. This week's House hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi turned into an allout Epstein match as she stonewalled Democrats for four hours and refused to apologize for the DOJ's handling of the files, even with survivors in the room. Let's watch a clip.</p>
<p>>> How many of Epstein's co-conspirators have you indicted? >> You showed it. You I I find it. >> How many have you >> Excuse me. I'm going to answer the question. >> I answer my question. >> No, I'm going to answer the question the way I want to answer the question. Your theatrics are the way I asked it. Chairman Jordan, I'm not going to get in the gutter with these people. >> You can let her filibuster all day long, but not on our watch. >> Not on our time. No way. And I told you about that, Attorney General, before you started. >> YOU DON'T TELL ME. >> OH, I did tell you because we saw what you did in the Senate. >> Lawyer, not even a lawyer.</p>
<p>>> Was the president aware of Secretary Lutnik's ties to Epstein when he chose him to lead the Department of of Commerce? >> Chris Men was a border patrol agent. >> Okay. So, I'm going to conclude that the president in fact did know about his ties because he was the next door neighbor. >> Shame on you. >> Oh, for goodness sakes. This is not a game. Secretary, >> I'm attorney general. >> My apologies. I couldn't tell. >> [snorts] >> So, I was on an airplane while this hearing was going on and consuming these</p>
<p>clips from the sky and I feel like if anyone was watching my face, like they would never figure out that I was watching a hearing cuz that was like some insane movie where I was like, "Oh, no, she didn't." And then like, "Oh, is that really happening?" and then almost crying when she wouldn't even turn to look at the survivors, which seems like the lowest level of basic decency uh that you could give to people. What were your big takeaways? >> Yeah, I felt like I was watching the</p>
<p>five. I mean, it was just it it was kidding. >> I I was about to be like, I wonder if it was lower or higher rated cuz that that's what Trump is looking for. He's like, did we get a big number? [laughter] >> Um my big takeaways kind of are twofold. Number one, she didn't answer a single question. Like she didn't about the Epstein files or really anything that Democrats threw her way. I think number two, and people may be mad at me for this, but I thought that the Democratic plan going into it was horrible. I mean, like I I I think like yes, you have a</p>
<p>very combative witness, but also like do better in terms of cross-examining her. I think a lot of the members on the Democratic side just used it as a way to talk rather than like some of the for five minutes. Sometimes they spoke for four and a half minutes and didn't ask a question, right? I mean, I thought it was ineffective. So, there were real opportunities to kind of press her on some key things. Like, for example, if I were up there, I would have brought up the 86page indictment with the three</p>
<p><strong>[03:05]</strong></p>
<p>co-conspirators and forced her to answer whether or not certain names were in there and then force her to go on record saying, "I can't answer whether or not Trump is in there." Right? Like, there are ways to kind of get some information out. And I didn't feel like it was that productive, unfortunately. And unfortunately for the survivors, I I tweeted out yesterday that [snorts] the real losers in the hearing, I mean, are the survivors. Those are the ones who lost. Like, at the end of the day, at the Democrats will move on, Republicans will move on, like Bondi will move on, but the survivors, they're stuck. >> Absolutely. I And I think the point</p>
<p>about the line of questioning could almost be applied to any hearing. I mean, we so rarely get anything of substance out of these. And because of the way the algorithm is designed, the way media is today, fundraising, etc., everybody's just looking for their moment in the sun and their takedown. I mean, every fundraising email that I got was like, "Did you see me with Pam Bonnet? I had members of Congress who I'm big fans of, you know, texting me their viral tweets." And I get it like some of it was impressive for sure, but</p>
<p>this story does feel different because we are talking about a sex trafficking ring, right? like it's not your regular or average story that we would be talking about in one of these hearings. I would say and I'm not a lawyer but I have consumed a lot of TV and both my parents are lawyers. Um, Pam Bondi was not going to answer any questioning, like even if she had been cross-examined properly, like you said, to push her on the 86page indictment, that that woman would respond, you know, well, the Dow</p>
<p>is at $50,000 or whatever. The level of disrespect for the importance of this story was so apparent. And I just I felt like at a certain point that people should get their grand standing in because this woman, whether it was a directive from on high or just that she actually is that soulless, had no intention of actually having a conversation about the contents of the Epstein files or how the DOJ had handled it.</p>
<p>>> Well, I think yeah, I mean I I agree with you. I think some members did a good job at that. like Crockett at the end, Jasmine Crockett. I thought her uh she just spoke for 5 minutes. And typically, I would say like, "No, you should ask her some questions, but she wasn't answering anything. You were the last person." And she pretty much read her to filth. Like I I fully was like, "Okay, great. Good. Good work, Congresswoman." I think for me, looking at Pam Bondi, and I've I've seen Pam Bondi in action for a long time. I'm from Florida. She was my attorney general uh growing up for eight years or so. She seemed really rattled up there. Like I don't I don't know why.</p>
<p>>> I thought so too. >> I I did not it she didn't come across as super composed or super measured. The burn book idea really to me I I get why she did it, but it didn't really land much. And she seemed as to me I think she's on the hot seat internally. I think that Trump is putting pressure on the DOJ saying why are we still talking about Epstein 2 weeks after you release the files? They can't get away from this story no matter what they're trying to</p>
<p><strong>[06:07]</strong></p>
<p>do. And so now you're in a situation where it's like you have a kind of lame duck AG up there in a way. But also I was kind of surprised and I I would like to get your take on this. No one asked about the six Democratic lawmakers who were almost indicted. Like to me that was kind of crazy, right? Like you don't even bring that up at all. Steve Con asked about Memphis um and National Guard deployment or ICE deployment there, but nothing about the fact that you almost indicted six lawmakers for sedicious conspiracy >> or how often a grand jury who typically will indict a ham sandwich was not</p>
<p>interested in your indictments. And uh from what I've read, uh Judge Piro, I'm like blanking on her title cuz she's just like Janine to me, uh brought in two prosecutors from Westchester County um that she used to work with to do this, which screams that there were probably a bunch of career folks who were not interested in bringing this forward, but it definitely is a big story. And I didn't connect those dots that that should have been at least a conversation when you have the attorney general in front of you as it continues with the vindictive streak of this</p>
<p>administration and that frankly the courts are the only way that we're getting any legitimate push back about them. So I like that point and I agree about Bondi being rattled. There were a few times where she actually like paused and you could see her mind working like what level of insane should I go now? and then the way that her voice was unleashed. And I've heard her give a lot of interviews at this point. I mean, she wasn't my AG, but I've I've consumed a lot of Pam Bondi um in the content sense. And she's usually pretty</p>
<p>authoritative. >> Yeah. >> Like I don't like what she's saying, but there was a reason that there were Democrats that voted to confirm her, right? Like this is a woman who has shown herself to be of substance in the past. Um don't attack me in the comments. I get it. I even said there was things that Pete Hexth could bring to the job. Not that I said that he should uh be confirmed, but she seemed to genuinely not know what direction to go in. And I'm curious about this cuz I've been asking some people that I've</p>
<p>talked to about like why wouldn't the DOJ just throw some indictments out there? No one's super close to Trump, right? But now you have those six co-conspirators, right? whose names were redacted and then Thomas Massie went crazy and he got the redactions out there like pick any I mean there are a bunch of people in these files it globally speaking you know you're indicting Russians for the Mueller report like just indict some people that don't really matter that don't even have</p>
<p>Donald Trump's phone number to at least say we're taking action and you can throw that back in people's faces because the frustration at this point is you're doing absolutely nothing we're not about Donald Trump or Howard Ledneck, who I'm not accusing of doing anything with underage women, but like >> there are really bad dudes in these files and you could get a win with your base cuz the MAGA base who've been</p>
<p><strong>[09:09]</strong></p>
<p>talking about the Epstein files for years, they're still really mad and they're getting madder like people like Tim P. >> I also think something that I mean you don't have to indict people for sex trafficking or anything related to underage girls or um women or any of that. You could there are easy ways to indict people in these files for money laundering, for tax evasion, right? Like financial related crimes because there's a whole host of lot so much money moving one way or the other. And so that's that's >> go after the banks. >> Go after the banks. Go after the banks. >> That's popular with everybody.</p>
<p>>> Go after the banks. I mean, and also like Les Wexner is lowhanging fruit in my opinion. Like that that is to me. >> He'll be in to testify, right? >> Yeah. He's going to play the fifth. Um, I wouldn't be surp I mean, he has no nothing no reason not to. It's not a criminal proceeding by any means. It's not a grand jury proceeding. They had enough to label him a co-conspirator internally. They did. And if they have enough to do that, they have enough to secure an indictment in my opinion if they want to. And the fact that they haven't kind of says everything you need</p>
<p>to know about this justice department. And it's not just this justice department. I think I do want to say four justice departments. every Justice Department since Bush, every single one. So, >> yeah. I mean, I think it's a it's a little bit different. And I want to see Alex Aosta again. This is like to me a political layup in that it is bipartisan. How much inappropriate behavior there has been and voters are willing to take off their team jerseys about this in general. There are some who are dug in and are like, "Well, the</p>
<p>Clintons blah blah." I'm like, "I don't care. like let them defend themselves. >> Not I mean I think it's absurd that Hillary is getting hauled in for any of this >> labeled in the fals twice indirectly. It wasn't I mean >> I think she last saw him in the '9s but anyway not new for her to be blamed for things uh going on in her husband's life. It's it's wildly frustrating. So Epstein's not the only topic that's defining Republicans at this point. And after more than a year of dodging tariffs, House Republicans defied Trump in two back-to-back votes with three</p>
<p>Republicans blocking a procedural shield and six joining Democrats to roll back tariffs on Canada, prompting Trump to threaten to primary um each of them on True Social, which is his favorite move. Um this is mostly symbolic, Erin, but why do you think it's actually happening at this point? I mean, they've been talking a big tariff game for a while, but it's the first time that we've seen an actual vote on it. Well, they want to stay employed. I mean, that that's why, right? Like, I think the six Republicans who broke from Trump, other than Don Bacon, who's not running for re-election</p>
<p>anymore, I mean, like, these are frontlininers. Like Kevin Kylie's a front liner. Brian Fitzpatrick, a frontliner. >> They want to kind of go on record ahead of November to say, "Listen, I never supported some of the crazier stuff coming out of this administration. When I could vote against tariffs, I did vote against tariffs." I don't think Trump is actually going to primary someone in a 50/50 district. I mean, I don't think</p>
<p><strong>[12:09]</strong></p>
<p>he's crazy. He'll say it, but I don't think he'll do it. I don't know that he'll offer his fullthroated support for Brian Fitzpatrick. But I also don't know that Fitzpatrick will >> I don't think that helps Brian Fitzpatrick. I'm sure he does not want him anywhere near him. >> Exactly. So, I think that's why it's happening now. It is largely symbolic. I was actually surprised that more Republicans didn't break from Trump on these tariffs because it kind of, in my opinion, if I was Johnson and Trump, like we know tariffs are unpopular. Give them the ability to vote against them. they're never going to override this veto because you're never going to get two/3 as we've seen over the past year, but give them some some leeway to vote</p>
<p>against tariffs. That didn't happen. So, I mean, I think that's why it's happening now, though, is because we're nearing the midterm elections and Trump's agenda is historically unpopular right now. His approval ratings not above 40% in most polls. Like, I mean, [snorts] it's it's just bad all around. So, any way that they can get away from him is they'll they'll take it. his approval rating so low that Gallup had to stop polling approval ratings. >> Yeah, that's a whole other discussion. No, I mean it is very expensive to do it, but I cannot get it out of my head that it has to be related to watching</p>
<p>what happened to Anne Selzer um from the De Mo Register uh with her presidential poll. I agree with you on the tariffs. It seems like a layup, especially when you look at the data on this. Tax Foundation calculated $1,000 per average family last year because of the tariffs. this year it's going to go up to $1,300. Um, but we did have a better thanex expected jobs report. So, it was kind of dueling days on this. So, there was the massive revision from 2025 that I think only like 181,000 jobs were added over the course of the entire year, which is</p>
<p>dismal um beyond imagination. Um, and then the report was what was it like 166,000 or something like that >> but I mean it could end up being revised down. It was mostly due to healthcare jobs which has been consistently the sector that's hiring a lot. Do you think that this is all part of the plan and like whatever Kevin Hassid and Peter Navaro have been talking about like they're really cooking with gas. It's just we needed to get into 2026 for it to happen. >> Well, my question is I was told that I shouldn't believe the bad job numbers</p>
<p>over the past several months. So, do I have to believe the good ones now? I'm just I don't I don't know what to believe and what not to believe when you're telling me half the time it's not your not Trump's economy. It's Biden's economy and it's bad numbers that were cooked by a liberal activist and now you have good job numbers coming out which these job numbers aren't even that great. They're just >> No, I'm sorry. [laughter] Yeah, let's be clear. So, an average month of Biden was about 350,000 jobs. So, it's just not zero or negative, which it's the participation trophy of the jobs number.</p>
<p>>> Yeah. Listen, I've never seen a that I think this is actually pretty historic. It's the first time in history that a FIFA prize winner also won this participation trophy as well. So, this is very new um to a lot of >> and a Nobel winner by extension >> by extension. And I think I think he got the best coal miner award this week too actually in the White House.</p>
<p><strong>[15:10]</strong></p>
<p>>> So, he's he's getting a lot of awards which good for him. Um >> yeah, >> but no, I mean >> more than my four-year-old. >> Yeah. I I don't know where this economy is going to go. I really don't. I think that all of this is also the writings on the wall for the White House in the sense they know that if the economy is kind of in the dumpster in November, it's not going to be good good for them. So, they're going to try to figure out a way to turn this around before the midterms in a way. Prices are still high. Wages are still stagnant, right? Like, yes, we had some decent job growth in one month, but ultimately you ask the</p>
<p>average American, can you get a new job? And the answer is no, right? like you have very few openings and thousands of applicants for each opening. So ultimately the Dow can hit 50,000 all they want and they can say they're adding all these numbers all they want. But if the average American isn't experiencing support and and help in the job market, then it's all for not. As I always say, learn from the Democrats mistakes because we went out there talking about our great GDP growth and</p>
<p>our jobs numbers and our, you know, fastest recovery in the G7 and nobody cared and [clears throat] went out and voted for Trump. So, >> because who knows what GDP stands for? I barely know what that stands for, right? Like, >> like like you want me to tell you? >> No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm I'm just I'm just saying that like I was playing I thought I thought we were being funny with each other. Okay, >> let's take a quick break. Stay with us. [music] >> Welcome back. On Thursday, Tom H. Homeman declared the end of immigration</p>
<p>enforcement in Minneapolis. Let's watch a clip. >> I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude. We have a lot of work to do across this country to remove public safety risk who shouldn't even be in this country. And to deliver on President Trump's promise for strong border security mass deportation, law enforcement officers drawn down from this surge operation will either return to the duty station or be signed elsewhere to achieve just that. ICE is a legitimate federal law</p>
<p>enforcement agency. We're not out scouring the streets to disappear people or deny people their civil rights or due process. We're going to force the immigration law. We're going to have a mass deportation. President Trump promised that and we're committed to that. >> That was fast, right? It was just what, two weeks ago that Homeman showed up. Then last week we had the scaling down of the 700 and now the surge is over. Were you surprised? I was surprised that it was this quick. >> Yeah, me too. I mean, what do they</p>
<p>always say? They say Jessarlo is always right. I mean, you did say that they bring in >> like literally no one says that. >> No one says that. But okay, Jessarlo is sometimes right. Um, you did say Tom Hman was going to be brought in and they were going to bring some normaly and potentially do this draw down. So, you kind of were talking about it. I mean, I'm kind of still in the I'll believe it when I see it mode, right? Like it's going to take some time for them to move out. And he did say at some point that there was still going to be some</p>
<p><strong>[18:11]</strong></p>
<p>presence on the ground even though it's going to be much smaller. Unless you are for no no ICE enforcement at all, right? Like the hardcore abolish ICE people who don't even think that the people who are here illegally, yes, but have committed crimes in the US and are eligible for pickup and deportation back to their own countries shouldn't be here. ICE is going to exist. There were, I think, 150 agents in Minneapolis before the surge, which went up to 3,000. But, you know, it is when he says it's a legitimate law</p>
<p>enforcement force, like so says government documents and they're funded through 2029, no matter what people want to believe. That's the that's the reality. >> It is. Um, but there's going to be a government shutdown uh for a little while. >> 100% 100%. And I think I think it's going to last through Trump's State of the Union. Um, I think it's going to be a prolonged shutdown. And I think that it's worth a prolonged shutdown because I don't think that any new money should be going to ICE in this time even if they're drawing down uh forces uh in</p>
<p>Minneapolis. Like I get that it's funded through 2029. But for me, I didn't I never liked the moniker abolish ICE. I actually preferred abolish Trump's ICE, just this version of the department in the sense that like I don't think this department this version of the department should exist. I think that violent criminals who are here illegally should not be here, but your average everyday undocumented immigrant who is here contributing to society should be here. Um, if they want to be, there should be a pathway to citizenship. I can go on my soap box all day. We'll see</p>
<p>what happens in Minneapolis. I just I worry that they're going to draw down in Minneapolis and then what? We're going to go to Springfield, Ohio, right? Like we're going to go to Philly. Where are we going to go next? Because that that's kind of Or are we just going to put a pause on this? put a pin on immigration until December, until after the midterms, until people so people forget about it a little more. What's going to happen next? >> Well, that would be smart of them since, you know, Donald Trump took his most popular issue and flushed it down the toilet with all of this. I don't think Steven Miller will be able to survive</p>
<p>waiting that long. But if Susie Wilds has any control, I I'm sure that she's saying we can't afford to do this. Allah Susan Collins was going to get a surge of ice uh to Maine. there were, you know, a few hundred that showed up and then she was like, >> "No, not >> DH [clears throat] secretary. No one, please get them out of here." >> Um, there was also a So Todd Lions, the acting ICE director, he was with uh congressional in a congressional hearing, then he was with the Senate and</p>
<p>something that he said, well, he said a bunch of interesting things. I I think he's very good in these hearings. I called him like a cool cucumber on the five. I don't agree with a lot of what he's saying, but he has the demeanor of someone that you would expect to be in that job. And uh Alyssa Slaken, Michigan senator, was pushing him about ICE to polling places. >> Did you hear his follow-up answer to that? >> Do you believe that ICE has the</p>
<p><strong>[21:12]</strong></p>
<p>authority to be deployed to US polling places around the country? >> So, ma'am, we're a civil obviously we do civil enforcement and criminal law enforcement. There's no reason for us to deploy to a polling facility. Homeland Security investigations, we do investigate voter fraud, which we've had made several arrests, most recently a high-profile one in Massachusetts. Like I say, ma'am, there's no reason to use ICE officers in that. >> Great. Well, I hope that in the privacy of that meeting when that comes down and the president feels like he's going to lose the midterm elections that you don't buckle</p>
<p>>> and if like the president calls, who knows what'll happen essentially. >> Okay. All right. So elections still in danger, but on the record that I should not be monitoring the polling places in the way that Trump wants. He basically admitted that there are people who are getting like 42 days of training and are out there. I mean, a lot of the things that Democrats had been saying that are going on. >> Uh he acknowledged. So you think we're heading to this shutdown? Do you think there's any give on the list of demands that the Democrats put out there um that Republicans will go for or it's full</p>
<p>stalemate? They're not gonna go for anything. >> Full stalemate. They're not going for anything. I mean, I don't know. I think the latest reporting was that they're going home. Like, they're gonna they're gonna vote the bills are going to fail and then they're going to go home for a week. So, like shut down all our guaranteed for a week and then we'll see how long it goes. But if I'm Democrats, shut it down until the end of the Trump administration. Shut it down for as long as you want. I am not funding ICE and DHS in its current form. and you hold out as long as you need to until they</p>
<p>cave because you don't do what you did last time 50 days later just cave after 50 days. You shut this down. >> How will life function if you shut it down until December? >> It's only one agency. Um >> I know, but DHS also covers FEMA. They cover the TSA. >> I hear you. But I mean, we're at we're at the point where the Democrats have all of the leverage for the first time, I really think in a long time. They have all of the leverage. If you're not dealing with a full government shutdown, you're dealing with an issue where you have twothirds of the country on your</p>
<p>side. Use it. Use the leverage that you have and force at least Donald Trump to give a state of the union during a government shutdown. Force some of these things to happen and then and then we'll see. I mean, yes, it is a shitty position to be in. [snorts] But ultimately, what are you going to do? You're just going to give them what they want and then what? And then continue to do this for 3 years and then just say like talk a big game and and not actually act on it. Democrats have been saying they're not going to they're not going to vote. They're not going to vote. They're not going to vote. If they turn around and vote, they're going to lose a lot of support.</p>
<p>>> I'm sure they're having uh panic about that. It's always like you get to the top of the mountain, right, and you're like, "Oh, this is what it feels like." And then you're like, "I'm going to walk myself down the other side." Um >> John Federman told this to >> they may lose uh their favorite raging moderate at some point. like at this point [clears throat] like >> I'm in and I'm out, you know? I'm like</p>
<p><strong>[24:15]</strong></p>
<p>always supportive but also always critical um based on the text messages that I get. Well, why'd you have to say that? I'm like, well, cuz I thought it was shitty. I want to talk about RFK for a second. So, his vaccine program, >> you see, he said he was snorting cocaine off a toilet seat the other day. >> I did see that. Anyway, so the vaccine stuff is not going well for him. So, he's going out on this eat real food tour. Yes. And I have always been very concerned about this aspect of the platform and this was going on when he</p>
<p>was running in the Democratic primary too that his positions on things like food dyes and getting healthy and redoing the food pyramid and talking about, you know, big food companies and processing and like all the stuff having to do with taking care of your body, not the medicine part cuz that he's totally crazy on. Um we just like we don't message well on it. Biden banned a few food dyes, never talked about it, right? Like if you ask the average Maha mom,</p>
<p>she has no idea that Biden cared about yellow dye. So what do you make of him being out there in this respect? And do you think that Democrats have a real problem with the Maja voters? >> No, because I don't really think people care or even know that he's out there doing this. Like I I I really don't. I mean, yes, Democrats could have messaged it better, but I don't think they're messaging it that well either right now. Like this new food pyramid, like I don't think it's kind of falling off the planet. Um, the dye is great. I mean, that's a bipartisan issue, but no one's really talking about the dyes because</p>
<p>the issue that Democrats have is that they don't know how to message their wins. The issue Republicans have is that they muddle their messaging with their wins. So, like he talks about the dye bands and then goes and snorts and >> then he's like, "Don't have Tylenol, >> right?" And then or don't have snorts cocaine >> or snores cocaine or whatever this is. So it's like the stuff that he wants and it's same thing with Trump with Trump. The stuff that they want publicly doesn't actually get there because all the viral clips are of the BS that they spew and so I don't I don't know how much this is actually reaching the average Maha voter or the average voter anyway.</p>
<p>>> All right. Uh did you see that Nancy Pelosi is backing Jack Slober in the in the New York 12 race? What do you think about that? >> I f it's fascinating. I've I I >> like a lot >> that woman is loyal. >> I like a lot of the people running in that race. I don't know. >> Well, cuz literally everybody in New York City is running in that race. >> Are you running? >> Except me. No, [laughter] >> I'm not. I'm interested in the race. No, I would be a terrible candidate. I am >> I'm ready too much. The oppo file is</p>
<p>[laughter] ready. >> I mean, our text messages you're going to be like, look. >> Um, no. I mean, I think Pelosi's I I wonder I'm curious to see how much her endorsement actually matters. That that is what I'm curious about. We'll see. But she's a prolific fundraiser, but I also don't know that he needs it. >> No, it's I mean, it's interesting. Obviously, they had a big family tragedy again with his sister Tatiana passing</p>
<p><strong>[27:15]</strong></p>
<p>away, and so he hasn't been as visible. Um, but it'll be very interesting to see how seriously he takes this. Wonder if Pelosi had a conversation with him that was like, "Is this real or is this a thing that you're going to do for a little bit and then you're going to go back to Vanity Fair and Tik Toking from the laundry room in your building?" My friend lives in the building and says he sees him in the laundry room and he'll be like, "You want to be in the video?" And he's like, "No, just want to do the laundry." Did you see I'm now looping back to</p>
<p>Epstein world um that Queen Elizabeth reportedly gave then Prince Andrew $7 million to settle with Virginia Juy and avoid a court fight over her sex abuse allegations. >> I did not see that. >> Well, here I am breaking the news to Aaron Parnes myself. Does that surprise you? >> I don't know that it surprises me. Um, I think the royal family is very much like incubators and want to protect their own as much as they can, but at this point, I mean, you can't protect Andrew. I</p>
<p>mean, he's all these files and he lied. He lied about Virginia Dufra and his relationship with her. So, the truth is slowly coming out. >> So, I have two thoughts about this. One, this feels very bad for the monarchy. like way worse than Prince Andrew actually existing because you had this image of everybody else within the royal family being on solid moral ground when it came to this. Like when they found out they were like you don't get your title anymore. You don't get to live</p>
<p>here anymore. Go off in the countryside and figure your way out. And I have felt like Prince Charles has had such a a Prince King now, your your excellency has been so like it must be so hard to have to turn on your brother like that, but he's been so by the book and saying, you know, investigate to the full extent of the law, etc. And then you see something like this and it feels like such a stain on the monarchy. I mean, obviously Queen Elizabeth is not around anymore uh to defend what happened, but</p>
<p>it did surprise me. It didn't it didn't feel like a move that she would have made. Last thing I wanted to ask you about the Ukrainian skeleton racer who was disqualified from the Winter Olympics after refusing to remove a helmet honoring 24 of the 500 plus Ukrainian athletes killed in the war. Violation of the IOC's rules on political statements. Um I was really bummed. I always am bummed when stuff like this happens, especially when it's so black and white as to who the good guys and the bad guys are and it doesn't</p>
<p>seem like a political statement to honor uh people who have been killed. Um, but do you think it's a bad move for the Olympics to legislate on something like this or it's like >> I just I don't I don't get how the Olympics can say that this is a bad political statement or whatnot when they banned Russia from competing. Is that not the same thing? Like the Olympics did that, right? Like they banned Russia. They said that you can't compete</p>
<p><strong>[30:16]</strong></p>
<p>under a Russian flag. And so when a Ukrainian wants to support those who died at the hands of the Russian government, like >> come on. >> Come on. >> Come on, >> IOC. Come on. Um on a whole host of reasons. All right. Uh what are you raging about? Um, it's not like super raging about, so I don't get like super hate for this, but like I hate the fact that the Amtrak schedule from DC to New York cuz I'm going this weekend uh does not run after like 11:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. Like I want to take a late night frame back and I have to stay the night now >> in New York. >> Yeah.</p>
<p>>> Oh, well, I'm not there. We could have hung out otherwise. [clears throat] >> Yeah. Well, >> um, but also no one wants to be on like a 2, three hour train ride in the middle of the night except you probably. >> I do. I do. I would love you alone in the train a 1000 p.m. train ride back and also or a plane ride. DCA has weird airport restrictions so nothing can land after 10 p.m. >> because of the rich people in Georgetown which is annoying. >> Maybe it'll be different when it's [clears throat] Trump International. Okay. What was Should we calm down about? >> Not much.</p>
<p>>> Yeah, it's pretty bad. Okay. >> All right. >> It was great to see you. I'll see you next week. >> See you next week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Howard Lutnick’s “reputation is in the sewer”</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Oe4Qqschj4g</link>
      <description>Yale School of Management’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld joins Jessica Tarlov and Scott Galloway on Raging Moderates to discuss Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s congressional testimony about Jeffrey Epstein.
#epsteinfiles #trump #podcast</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik is testifying 
before the Senate. Did you in fact make the visit to Jeffrey Epstein's private island? I did have 
lunch with him as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. This guy's reputation 
is in the sewer. He has overtly lied. On that clip you showed, it doesn't demonstrate whether 
or not he actually perjured himself under oath, but we do know that he said repeatedly into 
recently to the media that as you pointed out was 2005. He's had no more contact with 
that disgusting person. And now we see that he not only built a house next door to him, but 
he was investing in businesses for years later.</p>
<p>He stayed in contact for 12 years past. He told 
us he'd stopped all contact. Based upon what you know about Trump's view and his leadership 
style, how do you think that he's going to handle having a cabinet secretary caught in this 
kind of lie and the attention that it brings to the administration? If he takes the move on 
Lutnik and pushes him out, which he should, does that start the quote unquote proverbial 
slippery slope where all the indiscretions of Hegsth and others start to spiral out of 
control? I think it's possible that um he</p>
<p>could lose Lutnik. Lutnik is not popular on the 
cabinet. A lot of CEOs tell us after they shake hands with Howard Lutnik now, they want to wash 
their hands. I mean, obviously, they feel soiled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Trump’s racist post was a “desperate effort”</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2JMYeuR---U</link>
      <description>Yale School of Management’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld joins Jessica Tarlov and Scott Galloway to discuss how racist AI-generated content fits into a larger pattern of political “commandments”.
#trump #podcast #politics</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Using race is always a last resort of scoundrels and he's not above that. >> Last week, Trump posted a racist AI generated video of Barack and Michelle Obama. How does this kind of provocation fit into the patterns you identify in Trump's Ten Commandments, your new book? >> Those cartoons were not some subtle dog whistle. It was screaming racial uh venom at at the top of lungs. However, wherever he comes out on racial issues, he's using it strategically. Even though it comes out angry as as a midnight post, people think wrongly that these</p>
<p>are impulsive decisions. These are uh deliberate strategic devices. He tried Venezuela of Greenland the week after that, seizing these election ballots out of South Fton County. These are desperate efforts to change the subject from largely domestic issues he doesn't want to talk about. looking for ways to change the subject off of Epstein, affordability, healthc care issues, and using race is always a last resort of scoundrels. And he's not above that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Donald Trump took his most popular issue and flushed it down the toilet. >> There's going to be a government shutdown uh for a little while. >> Oh, you think that? >> 100%. I think it's going to last through Trump's State of the Union. I think it's going to be a prolonged shutdown. And I think that it's worth a prolonged shutdown because I don't think that any new money should be going to ICE in this time. I never liked the moniker abolish ICE. I actually preferred abolish Trump's ICE. Just this version of the department in the sense that like I don't think this version of the department should exist. I think that violent criminals who are here illegally should not be here, but your average</p>
<p>everyday undocumented immigrant who is here contributing to society should be here if they want to be. There should be a pathway to citizenship. I can go on my soap box all day, but I think that we'll see what happens in Minneapolis. I just worry that they're going to draw down in Minneapolis and then what? We're going to go to Springfield, Ohio, right? Like we're going to go to Philly. Where are we going to go next?</p>]]></content:encoded>

#epsteinfiles #trump #politics</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>This week's house hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi turned into an allout Epstein match. >> Excuse me. I'm going to answer the question. >> And I told you about that, Attorney General before you started. >> You don't tell me. >> Oh, I did tell you because we saw what you did in the Senate. >> Lawyer, not even a lawyer. >> This is not a game, Secretary. >> I'm attorney general. My apologies. I couldn't tell. So, I was on an airplane while this hearing was going on and consuming these clips from the sky. And I feel like if anyone was watching my face, like they would never figure out that I was</p>
<p>watching a hearing cuz I thought it was like some insane movie where I was like, "Oh, no, she didn't." And then like, "Oh, is that really happening?" And then almost crying when she wouldn't even turn to look at the survivors, which seems like the lowest level of basic decency. What were your big takeaways? Number one, she didn't answer a single question about the Epstein files or really anything that Democrats threw her way. I think number two, and people may be mad at me for this, but I thought that the Democratic plan going into it was horrible. Yes, you have a very combative witness, but also like do</p>
<p>better in terms of cross-examining her. The real losers in the hearing are the survivors. Those are the ones who lost.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>Did you see that Nancy Pelosi is backing Jack Slothber? Did >> what do you think about that? >> It's fascinating, >> right? That woman is loyal. >> I like a lot of the people running in that race. >> Well, cuz literally everybody in New York City is running in that race. >> Are you running? [laughter] >> No, I'm not. But I'm interested >> in running. >> No, I would be a terrible candidate. >> I'm curious to see how much her endorsement actually matters. But she's a prolific fundraiser, but I also don't know that he needs it. >> It'll be very interesting to see how seriously he takes this. I wonder if Pelosi had a conversation with him that was like, "Is this real or is this a</p>
<p>thing that you're going to do for a little bit and then you're going to go back to Vanity Fair and Tik Tocking from the laundry room in your building?" My friend lives in the building and says he sees him in the laundry room and he'll be like, "You want to be in the video?" And he's like, "No, just want to do the laundry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Is honoring the dead really a political statement? Jessica Tarlov and Aaron Parnas react to the disqualification of a Ukrainian athlete from the Winter Olympics, on Raging Moderates.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>the Ukrainian skeleton racer who was disqualified from the Winter Olympics after refusing to remove a helmet honoring 24 of the 500 plus Ukrainian athletes killed in the war. Violation of the IOC's rules on political statements. Um I was really bummed. I always am bummed when stuff like this happens, especially when it's so black and white as to who the good guys and the bad guys are. and it doesn't seem like a political statement to honor people who have been killed. Um, but do you think it's a bad move for the Olympics to</p>
<p>legislate on something like this? >> I don't get how the Olympics can say that this is a bad political statement or whatnot when they banned Russia from competing. Is that not the same thing? Like the Olympics did that, right? Like they banned Russia. They said that you can't compete under a Russian flag. And so when a Ukrainian wants to support those who died at the hands of the Russian government, like come on. >> Come on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Failed Attempt to Silence Stephen Colbert</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CYwQDpT6Ah4</link>
      <description>After CBS pulled his interview with Texas Rep. James Talarico from the air, Stephen Colbert had some words for Trump’s FCC Chair Brendan Carr. Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov discuss corporate media “bending the knee” to the Trump administration, on Raging Moderates.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>
<p>James Talarico, the
charismatic Texas state
representative, was scheduled to be interviewed by Stephen Colbert
on his show this past
Monday night. But at the last
minute, CBS told the hosts that the interview
would not air and that
he shouldn't talk about it on the show. Colbert doesn't appear
to be complying. He called out
FCC Chair Brendan Carr
by name. On January
21st of this year, a letter
was released by FCC chairman and smug bowling
pin Brendan Carr. Well, sir, you're
chairman of the FCC, so FCC you. It appears to be
another example</p>
<p>where corporate
media is responding
to the Trump administration’s
policies, or... desires,
if you will. They're just ghoulish
at this point, and they're more
interested in the tiny fights, I feel like,
than the big ones. Or maybe
they feel like if they do the tiny
fights, then we won't notice
the big ones. But I feel like this is just
going to be another L for them. It's a really bad look for these
networks to constantly
be bending the knee, and you don't get
anything in return. That is the lesson we have seen
thus far. You are not better
off by doing this.</p>
<p>You're
just losing money or brand value, which translates
into money. I think
it's important we're clear on what actually happened
here. Paramount is trying to get regulatory approval
for a merger, and the FCC chair
sends a letter, not even a rule,
but a letter about equal time, which is a ruse
for censorship. And CBS lawyers
immediately spike a guest
booking on a show. That has three months
left on the air anyway.</p>
<p>That's not regulatory
or legal caution. That's a protection
payment. And here, in terms of that payment,
the currency is editorial
independence, and they spent it
on the cheap. Meanwhile, Colbert
does exactly the right thing, defies
the order. Talks about the defiance
on air, posts the interview
on YouTube, and the interview that CBS
tried to kill will get more views
in any interview they actually aired
this month. They're not
silencing speech, which is their
objective. They've accidentally
turbocharged it. The folks working on
the Talarico</p>
<p>campaign
for Senate are like, “who do we
send the flowers to?”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Censoring Stephen Colbert BACKFIRES</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbWeHOAKHPc</link>
      <description>Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov break down how censoring Colbert backfired on CBS — after Texas state Rep. James Talarico’s scheduled appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was abruptly pulled off the air. Is this corporate media caving to Trump-era pressure — and is Paramount the real loser? Then: the DOJ says it’s done releasing the Epstein files — but reports suggest the public has seen just 2% of them. If that’s true, who’s still exposed, and why is the department claiming mission accomplished? Plus: a DHS funding showdown is underway in Congress. With ICE funding already secured, and public trust in government near historic lows, which party blinks first?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[00:04]</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Raging Moderates. I'm Scott Callaway. >> And I'm Jessica Tarliff. >> In today's episode, we're going to discuss Taller Rico Gate, how the DOJ has only released 2% of the Epstein files, and what it's still hiding, and the future of ICE. Uh, if you haven't already, please make sure to subscribe to our YouTube page to get up-to-date coverage on everything happening. All right, let's get into it. James Terico, the charismatic Texas state representative, was scheduled to be interviewed by Steven Colbear on his show this past Monday night, but at the last minute, CBS told the host that the interview would not air and that he</p>
<p>shouldn't talk about it on the show. Colbear called out FCC Chair Brendan Carr by name. It's another case where corporate media is responding to Trump administration policies. Jess, what's your take here? >> Paging Ted Cruz. Remember how Ted Cruz was the voice of reason when this happened with Jimmy Kimmel just a few months ago? It feels like forever ago, but it was just a few months. They're obviously, you know, trying to run the same playbook. They attempted this with The View. Taller Rico was on the View um a couple of weeks ago. And you know,</p>
<p>it's disappointing that corporate media keeps bending the knee. Corporate law firms, corporate me, anything with corporate in front of it uh seems to not be doing that well, finding their spine in the Trump era. But I thought it was very well handled by Co Bear. And you know, I was one of the millions of people that immediately clicked that YouTube link and listened to the interview uh this morning as I was walking down here to record this podcast. And you know, it gave them a bit of a badass sheen that uh two kind</p>
<p>of arguably, you know, dorky guys like Steven Colbear and James Tarico wouldn't normally have. But I, you know, I think it's just another lesson in how things go during the Trump era. it will continue down this path and people need to continue to find their voice against it. I just like don't understand though why the Trump administration keeps committing these own goals, right? Cuz it's just going to drive people. I mean, I was going to watch James Terico no</p>
<p>matter what, but there are a lot of people who wouldn't normally tune into Colbear who don't particularly care about James Terrier or even know what's going on in the Texas Senate primary on the Democratic side who are now more interested in him. So, doesn't it just completely defeat the purpose of what they were trying to do in getting Terico off the air? >> I can't imagine if there were a conspiracy here, it would be that the biggest funer of Terico or the biggest uh proponent of the Tal Rico campaign, planted someone at the FCC and convinced</p>
<p>them to do this. >> Should we make Brendan Carr for Terico t-shirts? >> This is all of a sudden. So, first off, let's talk about the losers. Paramount CBS spiked a 60 Minutes story. Appears to have By the way, Anderson Cooper announced he's leaving 60 Minutes. >> I saw that's so sad. 20 years. >> Oh, I I'm I'm name dropping right now. I</p>
<p><strong>[03:04]</strong></p>
<p>know I know Anderson and I text him like smart move. He's He spent 20 years there. It's built his brand. He did a great job and leaving on his terms absolutely the right thing to do and it sends a very strong signal. And quite frankly, if there was an enterprising producer could probably call half the producers at 60 Minutes and raise $50 million from a from a Democratic uh billionaire and say, "I'm going to start something called um, you know, 3600 seconds and basically re, you know, reimagine 60 Minutes like it used to</p>
<p>be." I think that's a big opportunity. But it Paramount CBS keeps saying, "Oh, we're no longer an independent news network. We are the propaganda arm of the Trump administration and it's just not going to serve them well." And as evidence of that, the first week that they had their new anchor for CBS News, their viewership went from 5 million a night to 4 million. Now, I will see say this, it's keeping CBS in the news, which is literally going from irrelevant to less than irrelevant. So they're in</p>
<p>the news a lot, but for the wrong reasons. And uh so Paramount CBS, huge loser here, no doubt about it. The Trump administration cementss the notion they don't believe in a free press, which only massively juices the viewership of this interview. Uh the other loser, unfortunately, through no fault of her own, is Representative Crockett, who Tarico just got this wind in his sales where he's seen as this resistance fighter that everyone is so scared of. The Empire has put out all sorts of hits on him which makes him look like a</p>
<p>bigger threat. And obviously Cole Bear is an enormous winner here because he continues to look like, you know, his hat is just starched bright white. But this was effectively, you know, this wasn't censorship. Um, this was amplification. Brendan Carr just made Terico famous in Texas. Terico could have raised 20 or $30 million. it wouldn't have done as much for his campaign as Brendan Carr just did. >> It's also an interesting contrast. You know, we just had the Munich Security</p>
<p>Conference and the right-wing and Republican party here is always bitching about censorship abroad, right? And how we're the bastion of free speech here. And I'm I'm pretty sure that there's stuff on TV in Germany and in England that Brendan Carr would have his panties in a bunch about here. Um it's super embarrassing on that front. And you just see I mean no matter what story we're covering and you know we're going to</p>
<p>talk about the Epstein files, we're going to talk about what's going on with immigration enforcement and ICE. You just like tick down the line of lines of the Constitution and say, "Oh, guess this is irrelevant now. Oh, guess this is irrelevant now. Oh, guess this is irrelevant now. And it's such a huge opportunity for Democrats to come out and just be on the side of the Constitution, right? Like that these are</p>
<p><strong>[06:05]</strong></p>
<p>our core values that speech is protected. And I mean, hiding behind the equal time rule is not going to get you anywhere since Jasmine Crockett has been on Colar. And I'm sure Stephven Colbear would welcome Ken Paxton on to the show could talk about, you know, his legislative career, also his affairs, or John Cornin, who I think would have a much more successful interview, and he doesn't have any skeletons in his closet as far as I know, but he doesn't want to have his feet held to the proverbial fire over the Trump administration's policies. So, they're not interested in it. But this idea that, and this is why</p>
<p>I started with paging Ted Cruz, that there's no slippery slope here, and I hope that Democrats always stand on the side of the Constitution, but there are going to be ruthless people out there that once the Democrats come back into power are saying we should do exactly to them what they did to us. And they wouldn't be wrong for it. And the Republicans that are speaking out at this moment saying like, "Cool it, guys." You know, this is not a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth term for Donald Trump in the</p>
<p>hopper, right? Like there's a big chance that we're going to lose the midterm. This is me being them, not me being a Democrat. Lose the midterms. Definitely the House. Maybe a lot of smart people think the Senate's in play. And then 2028, not a foregone conclusion at all, especially if you have JD Vance on top of the ticket. This is a very narrow way to be governing at this particular moment. And it's such a petty small fight. What do you care about 7 and 1/2 minutes of Steven Colbear talking to James Tarico about Christ? I mean,</p>
<p>that's literally what they were talking about. Like that billionaires are bad and that it reduces the importance of Jesus to make him a political issue. That that was the content that they were so afraid of. >> Yeah, I'm now comfortable calling the Trump administration fascist. That's the bad news. The good news is the really [ __ ] stupid fascists. They continue to make these sort of own goals around that just nobody thought to if you type this into an LLM and say</p>
<p>what are the risks of the FCC chair trying to spike an interview with a Democratic Senate candidate. I mean, every LLM would go would come back and say, "No, that's a stupid idea." So, they get their tariff numbers from AI, but they don't bother to run this through. I can't imagine the PR executive or the strategist at the Trump administration saying, "Yeah, Co Bear won't say anything. This won't this</p>
<p>won't bring more heat." >> Like Coar isn't even afraid of his own boss at this point. He's like, "I have three months left to go." Like, yolo. And Colbear is going to I mean his show is ending. If they had just ignored Co Bear, quite frankly, he just wouldn't be nearly as relevant right now because his show does not his show loses a lot of money. And this is a cap, you know,</p>
<p><strong>[09:06]</strong></p>
<p>media companies are capitalist, but this comes across as just such um and we're beating a dead I'm beating a dead horse here. So um such extraordinary censorship. And what'll be interesting is to see how many Republicans come out and say this was a bad move. Cuz it won't be a litmus test of their backbone. It'll be a litmus test of their assessment if whether Trump is losing >> popularity and losing a step. Because I find these guys start to find their</p>
<p>testicles when they think there's less and less danger of a blowback from the Trump administration. It's sort of almost like a weakness indicator of whether they think that the Trump fever is about to break. >> Yeah. And it's also an easy one. You know what I mean? Like you don't have to come out against his immigration policy if you just say, >> "Yeah, I believe in free speech. >> Let Telerico be on Co Bear and air it on a regular network instead of it being a YouTube thing." But it is a good precursor for whatever YouTube show or podcast or whatever Co Bear is going to</p>
<p>be uh doing it come May when he no longer has this job anymore. Though, I feel like you should take a few months off at least. Everyone needs needs a break. >> All right, let's take a quick break. Stay with us. Welcome back. The Justice Department says it's wrapped its final release of the Epstein files under the transparency law, but new reporting suggests the public has seen maybe just 2% of the total data seized. And already executives, politicians, academics, and</p>
<p>even a sitting cabinet secretary are facing the threat of resignations, investigations, and serious reputational damage. Jess, if this is only a fraction of the evidence, why is the DOJ saying they fulfilled the Epstein Files Transparency Act? >> Well, because they're lying. But >> that makes sense. >> Okay. Is that the end of the show? Because they're lying. >> Don, correct? >> Yeah. Ding, ding, ding. So, the past couple of weeks, you know, I've been very down about this, which I think anyone who's consuming the news as it relates to the Epstein files would be.</p>
<p>And you're, you know, horrified and sad and it's so harrowing what happened to these victims and the frustration about so few people caring and there being consequences. And I felt for a couple weeks there that something was going to change. I'm not saying everybody was going to be prosecuted, but it did feel like there was some momentum and seeing now that the DOJ is saying we're done and you know doing crazy things like releasing</p>
<p>all the names involved and then they put out like Janice Joplain on a list who was Epste was 17 when she passed away and you know crowding names together like Joplain and Larry Nasser for instance you realize nothing's going to happen. And I'm getting really sick of</p>
<p><strong>[12:08]</strong></p>
<p>seeing headlines from around the world like last night, you know, breaking French police raid multiple locations in Jeffrey Epstein criminal probe, including the Arab World Institute, right? You're having resignations of people out of foreign governments because they were just in contact with this guy. Kier Starmer may not be the UK prime minister anymore over bad judgment as it relates to putting, you know, someone in uh in government who was linked to him. And I just think like we're not going to do anything. Like</p>
<p>Brad Karp doesn't have his job anymore. I saw Casey Wasserman, the you know, the mega agent stepping down. But it put Pam Bondi's performance last week in a new light to me. Like I actually I thought it was so bad and it was so embarrassing. Not just the stuff everyone's been making fun of, like you got asked a question about a pedophile and you screamed Dow 50,000. Like that's funny in an SNL sense, but I really thought that the image of this attorney general not even turning around to make</p>
<p>eye contact with the survivors, women who have endured something that no one should have to would show Trump that she was not up to this job or that she was just going to be enough of a PR nightmare that she should be gone. But honestly, like looking at it now a few days later, I think it's what Trump wanted. I think that he has made it clear and that Marjgery Taylor Green has been talking about this in interviews that he is the one who has been blocking this and he told her to go out there and be as ridiculous as she</p>
<p>needs to be as long as she is stonewalling. And so I have basically no faith in the idea that there will be any substantive consequences from this or that we're going to find out that much more. Um, so that's I don't want to be Debbie Downer, but that's where I am. >> I'm more hopeful in the sense that I do think there are going to be consequences here, but I think they're going to happen in 2029. And also, I think Democrats and Merrick Garland have to take some responsibility for why these files weren't released</p>
<p>earlier, why there haven't been any indictments, why there hasn't been more aggressive push to get to the bottom of what's gone on here during Democratic administrations. What's come to light here is that the Republican party, I mean that that was a real moment that you just referenced when um Representative Jipal asked the survivors or survivors to stand up and all of them had reached out to the DOJ and none of them uh had their uh overtures. The DOJ has no interest in interviewing these victims. I mean,</p>
<p>you'd think that one they would provide insight into crimes and possibly even exonerate some people, but it's clear it's no longer the Department of Justice. It's the Department of Delay and obfuscation. And quite frankly, I think someone did type this into AI and said these in some form are going to come out in some format. What's the best way to do it? They said confuse the [ __ ] out of everyone. Release a ton of [ __ ] that makes no sense. Then drip it out and</p>
<p><strong>[15:11]</strong></p>
<p>create a ton of confusion. And this is what's happened. Um there is like you said just total confusion. This is a total GRU propaganda technique and that is overwhelm and flood the zone with information some true information some false information and make it such that everyone just fed up and shrugs their shoulders. And where I part from the majority of my progressive brothers and sisters is that I don't believe they should have released the files. I think the way they the Department of Justice and the other agencies who have compiled this data should be communicating with the public is through indictments and</p>
<p>saying we are indicting the following people uh for what we believe uh is criminal activity specifically child rape or trafficking trafficking girls or providing infrastructure for the abuse of children. But instead they let out everything and we're all like, "Oh, you know what is what does a spiritual guru guru think?" And by the way, if a cabinet member purggers himself under oath and is all indignant about having nothing to do with him and then it comes</p>
<p>out that he had a lot to do with him, that's criminal activity. But this has worked out perfectly or near perfectly in my view. Perfect is the wrong word. It's been less bad than it should be for the Trump administration because they have weaponized our institutions. our institutions. The Department of Justice is the most poorly named government agency in the world right now. This has nothing to do with justice. It's the Department of Propaganda. It's the Department of Delay and obuscation. And I do actually think they're doing a really good job because well, while we're focused on what creeps, spiritual</p>
<p>guru or wellness longevity doctors are, the government officials or grown men who have engaged in child rape, nothing's going to happen. I am fairly confident that there's enough anger out there that a new attorney general in 28/29 is going to come for some of these people. I think that there's enough thirst out there for blood and some sort of justice uh that you're going to see something happen. It's just not going to happen for another 3 years. And I don't know</p>
<p>what the I don't know what the statute of limitations is on some of these things. >> Yeah. I mean, that's the problem with a lot of it anyway. And I think where some folks that have been implicated have been taking some degree of solace in the situation. But you know it's it's a criminal question but it's also a moral question right about the type of people who should be in leadership positions. And I don't want to paint too broad of a brush. There are obviously people that</p>
<p>are just you know casually like went to a dinner party there. Um, you know, maybe their EAS didn't mention you're going to dinner at a convicted sex offender's house who was soliciting prostitution from a minor, but you know, plenty of people who also were in communication after he was prosecuted again, right, for the stuff that ended him in a jail cell and, you know,</p>
<p><strong>[18:14]</strong></p>
<p>murdered. I mean, it was really interesting. Julie K. Brown, the pioneering journalist on this from the Miami Herald, said she doesn't think that he killed himself. And now that we know about like the erased tapes from the cell and you know that there are entries into the files about dummy bodies coming out different sides of the prisons to distract from the whole situation. There is obviously a lot more to this story and I think that it would be nice if we could get those details and that people could be reading from the same playbook because there's also a ton of bad information in these files to</p>
<p>your point about everything getting released or not really everything. um since it's only going to be 2% of it. Um, but you know, I get very tinfoil hat e about these things and I'm going down a lot of rabbit holes around, you know, the dentist chair that was in his house and the girlfriend that he had, the Bellarusian woman who got into Colombia dental school and, you know, had no business being there. Two administrators I believe have been fired in connection with that. But there's a whole section</p>
<p>of the internet that is, you know, talking about how the dental chair was to remove girls teeth so that they wouldn't bite back. You know, like you could go down a number of really scary paths. Um, I guess I do want to be hopeful though for a second and talk about what's going on in New Mexico. So, you saw how there was an exchange uh in the files about how there might be bodies buried at Epstein Zoro Ranch, which is in New Mexico. That ranch is now owned um by this big MAGA guy who's</p>
<p>running for Texas controller. His son works in the White House, by the way. As an aside, he's endorsed by Turning Point at this point. He was refusing to let people come um and look for the bodies on the ranch. Uh but New Mexico lawmakers last night voted unanimously to approve a truth commission with subpoena power um to probe trafficking and sexual assault at the ranch and that starts effective today. So that testimony actually could lead to prosecution. So I I hope that state lawmakers across the country are taking</p>
<p>note of what is possible even without the DOJ wanting to help out. Maybe you'll get some answers when it comes to that. But, you know, I it's all kind of comical, right, when you think like the guy who owns it now is, you know, his son works in the White House and he's not letting people on there. Like, why wouldn't you let people on there to see if there are dead girls buried on your property? Also, why would you want to live on a property that might have dead girls buried on it? >> Yeah. The the problem with all these</p>
<p>rabbit holes is I I worry that they're weapons of mass distraction and that we're all falling into it. So for I thought Ro Kana, Representative Kana summarized it perfectly. He said, open quote to have Janice Joplain who died when Epstein was 17 in the same list as Larry Nasser who went to prison for sexual abuse of hundreds of young women in child pornography with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd. The key to the Epstein files, but the</p>
<p><strong>[21:15]</strong></p>
<p>American public wants it all. I actually think the key to the power of investigatory agencies and justice is what's not released and that is the Department of Justice is there to create incentives specifically or in this case an incentive that tells people if you engage in child rape you're going to pay a huge price. I don't think they're there to ruin you mentioned Casey Wasserman. As far as I can tell Casey Wasserman sent flirtatious emails to Gelain Maxwell before he was even convicted the first time in 2008. Everyone becomes the [ __ ] pope and Jesus when they get behind a keyboard</p>
<p>and they want to engage in this ringlight virtue that the algorithms love of tearing down people. I even saw this one person putting out Tik Toks about how we should not endorse the brands of the I won't even mention their names cuz I but these two famous models because they had email interaction with Jeffrey Epstein. Look, the guy the guy had a yacht and threw great parties. I hate to break it to you folks, but a lot of wealthy men and models really enjoy those things and will email with people. That doesn't mean we should be ruining</p>
<p>their careers. And all we are doing by creating this like citizen ringlight, I wouldn't even call it journalism, but gossip/ slander is deluding from the focus of the department or what should be the focus of the department of justice. And that is to indict, convict, and imprison criminals. and instead we're trying to instead we're talking about oh this guy this you know this guy should resign or this guy should or shouldn't be on CVS. I I I</p>
<p>think it's I think it's an incredible miscarriage of justice and we are falling into the exact trap that the Trump administration has laid for us and that is the Department of Justice isn't in the business of finding out what emails out you as a total [ __ ] creep. Okay, that's bad. It's really distasteful. It's not the business that the Department of Justice should be in. The Department of Justice should be in the business of putting a man who is alleged to have impregnated an 11-year-old on this island, putting him in prison for the rest of his life, such</p>
<p>that the next time a an Epstein class of person believes that they can rape children, thinks twice, and says, you know, maybe I shouldn't do this because someone's going to come for me and put me in prison. and that women who are abused like this or girls who are abused think the department of justice has my back. They may be slow but that the arc of the department of justice bends towards truth and justice. This this department has lost so much credibility</p>
<p>but they are doing this and to a certain extent the Trump administration is getting a lot of flack. I think they've put on a master class here, courtesy of Professor GRU on how to distract from pedophilia and crimes potentially committed by some of the most powerful people in the world. And instead, we're focused on all of the fun and all of the gossip and oh, this guy, this guy's a creep. Okay? Or this individual had</p>
<p><strong>[24:18]</strong></p>
<p>contact with this person. let's talk about it and let's pass judgment on it because from a from a keyboard I'm really [ __ ] virtuous and can judge other people. This has been in my view the Trump administration if they are trying to create uh diversion, confusion, delusion. We've fallen into that trap. They have played us. >> Now I feel sad because I've been played. But I I just wanted to add well two things. Um, on the Peter Aia front, cuz you, you know, referenced that I do</p>
<p>think that there is a difference between people who have been caught up in this and had a few exchanges with him or, you know, flirted a little with Galen Maxwell before anyone was convicted and someone who exchanged what was like 1,850 emails uh with the person and seems to have from those emails some understanding of who Jeffrey Epstein actually was. And you know, being a a medical contributor, somebody that</p>
<p>people go to for health advice should, I think, carry even like an extra level of weight or importance to it. And I'm not accusing him of doing anything with little girls or anything like that, but I think it is going to be very hard and this would turn into a business decision, which Barry Weiss has decided as of now that she is keeping him. that when you turn on the TV and he's talking to you about longevity that you hear echoes in your mind of someone saying, you know, I but we can't tell anyone</p>
<p>about who you actually are and that he was with Epstein when his baby was in the ICU, which he wrote about in his book. Like, I I'm not with you on some of these. People have been caught up in it. I I think that you need to as a full-g grown adult express some better judgment when you are clearly aware of at least a few details about this guy that indicate that he is no good and of and of zero moral fiber at the very</p>
<p>least. The second component about people needing to be convicted of things and to pay some sort of price. It is interesting in the latest trunch of documents that came out that there is evidence that the FBI interviewed a victim who credibly accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and this happened in 2019. And there will be a question this DOJ, you know, isn't going to do anything about it. And again, I am not saying I have no evidence that Donald Trump do did this. I'm saying that there</p>
<p>is an interview in these in the latest trunch of uh Epstein files on this and that Bondi may have perjured herself when she was testifying because she said that Trump was not implicated in anything and that might be a legal question that the Democrats make something of. That was the only thing that kind of stood out on the legal front from her testimony. I think if</p>
<p><strong>[27:18]</strong></p>
<p>somebody has perjured themselves, the Department of Justice has an obligation to indict them or say, "We believe this person perjured themselves." Whether it was, >> you think Todd Blanch is going to be like, "Pam, you've gone too far." Now, >> look, and that might be that'll probably be a a different Department of Justice. Um, when it comes to someone like uh Peter Aia, the department, and this is the gray zone, the Department of Justice might feel that if a medical doctor who's been licensed and accredited by certain medical boards, do they have an</p>
<p>obligation to inform them of what might have been criminal activity? Look, President Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts and he was found civily liable for sexual abuse. I believe that warrants additional investigation by the Department of Justice for what appears to be evidence that he may have engaged in more criminal activity, which I believe gives the Department of Justice a fact pattern where they probably want to further investigate the president and his activities</p>
<p>with respect to somebody just being an abysmal human being who is also providing medical advice and it's handled themselves incredibly poorly and has probably no business giving other people medical advice and having a big platform. I agree with that. I think that's hard to argue against. The question is, is that the business that the DOJ is in? >> Is that what they do? Uh because how far down do we go? And my view is the</p>
<p>following litmus test. Is this person guilty or is there evidence that warrants government resources to file a criminal indictment against this person? That's it. And as much fun as it is to call these people out deservedly for what incredible [ __ ] hypocrats hypocrites they are. I mean, Secretary Lutnik, my view is he's such an idiot that he committed a crime trying to cover up what wasn't a crime. If he had just said, "Really poor judgment. This guy was my neighbor. He seemed like a</p>
<p>baller. I thought he was wellconed. Me and my kids went to his island. Just really poor judgment. It'd be over. Instead, he testified under oath that he was he immediately smelled a rat and wanted nothing to do. Okay, that's called perjury. Sir, where is the line here? What is the Department of Justice in the business of and what are they not in the business of? >> I totally agree with you. Um, I think it's a real question also about our quality of</p>
<p>journalists and how few people trust anyone in any sort of position of power, whether it's government or the quote unquote mainstream media. And that was part of the drive for getting all these files out here. But the problem is you have, you know, citizen journalists or just anyone with an access with access to an ex account or whatever whatever social media channel you happen to be on</p>
<p><strong>[30:18]</strong></p>
<p>and then that becomes Bible to you and it splinters us even more. Um, but there's no question that these survivors deserve a lot more than they are getting and probably than they are ever to get. Um, in terms of even recognition for what they went through and we should make sure that the focus always stays on that cuz it it's it's just terrible. and to see the pain in their eyes and to listen to these interviews. Um, it's it's sickening and it it's just really</p>
<p>sad. I think a decent opening statement or confirmation for a nominee for the next attorney general, hopefully under a Democratic administration, would be, "I am laser-like focused on bringing justice to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and criminally indicting the people who engage in criminal activity, who engaged in child rape, provided infrastructure for it, trafficked it, and that is it. That is where I'm going to focus all my</p>
<p>resources and that is it. And if you're looking for titillating information on what a [ __ ] creep someone is, that's not why I'm here. >> Yeah. A professionalization of the office uh would be good. >> People don't realize, and this goes to just how much damage social media has done. There are two ways you don't get chained by the community and cast out into the darkness and get eaten alive by bears and wolves. And that is one through either strength or wisdom. And one unfortunate means of somehow</p>
<p>granting wisdom in a very fake, superficial, but what seems to be increasingly important, I don't know, vehicle is the social media algorithms give you likes and attention and money if you feed into the algorithm. And finding somebody famous who is in these files for whatever reason is going to get you is the algorithms love it. It's embarrassing for them. It creates conversation. It creates likes. It creates another 50, 80, 100 bucks from AdSense on YouTube.</p>
<p>And it elevates information that in my view often times does nothing but polarize us, divide us. And here's how we end up with a Vance Teal presidency, which is if Vance is is president, be clear, Teal's not going to be his vice president. He'll actually be the president. Vance will be the VP again. This is how it happens on the left. We just [ __ ] attack each other. Casey Wasserman, that's who's got to resign. That that who's that's the guy</p>
<p>flirtatious emails with Gelain Maxwell before before Epstein is ever convicted of anything. That's the guy who's whose career we're ruining. That's the one who pays the price. >> You saw um that great image. I think it was New Yorker did it. Um, with all the red arrows that point in one direction and then blue arrows are all pointing in</p>
<p><strong>[33:19]</strong></p>
<p>different directions and at each other as a, you know, metaphor for how Republicans do politics and how Democrats do politics. And we are the ultimate circular firing squad every time. >> I'm triggered. I'm totally triggered here because and whenever I talk about the epsin by the when I when I think I was summarizing something you had said and I said that if somebody this individual I said something along the lines of this person should be criminally or indicted and pursued for sex with underage women. All of the comments all of the comments</p>
<p>were about the words I chose. Scott, they're not underage women. They're girls. 100% right. 100% right. I will change my language. They're absolutely right. Essentially, this is what Democrats are really good at. We have fascists and people who seem to be covering for pedophiles coming across the planes towards us and we're in a trench [ __ ] posting each other and saying, "You're holding the gun wrong. You're my ally, but you're holding the you chose the wrong words, so I'm coming for you."</p>
<p>It's a our inability to embrace imperfect allies is how we lose this war >> 100%. >> Let's take a quick break. Stay with us. >> Support for today's show comes from Framer.

Before we go, Congress is</p>
<p>deadlocked over funding the Department of Homeland Security and the fight over ICE reform is unfolding as immigration enforcement continues expanding. Senate Democrats want body cameras and ID rules for agents. Republicans say ICE funding is already secured through 2028 and warn the shutdown is instead hitting FEMA and TSA. Jess, who do you think blinks first and how long uh can this drag on?</p>
<p><strong>[36:20]</strong></p>
<p>>> I think it could go on for a while. I mean, especially because it's concentrated in DHS. It does not seem like Democrats really any of them except like Federman uh really has much appetite for compromising. Um especially on some of these key planks. It'll be interesting if Republicans, you know, get it together and come back and say these are the two or three proposals that we can live with. I mean, even some very conservative senators um have said, you know, definitely open to body cams. Masks seem to be where they're drawing</p>
<p>the line. Like Tom Hman even said, "We don't want to have to be wearing masks, but people's families are getting doxed." Um I'm think that there's probably a correlation between what these agents are doing and the fact that people are coming after them. Um I am not in any way justifying it. I think that, you know, doxing is unacceptable. people's families need to be, you know, kept safe and protected. Um, but there's probably more, as with everything that we agree upon than we don't. Um, but I</p>
<p>think this one could go for a while. Um, lot of agencies affected, TSA, FEMA, Coast Guard, Secret Service, um, ICE, obviously, US Customs and Border Patrol, but it is funded through the end of the Trump administration because of the reconciliation bill. they got an extra $75 billion. So, it's a bit of a a false choice talking point, I guess, to say, you know, defund ICE or we're going to defund ICE. You can't. That money has gone out the door. But I wanted to frame</p>
<p>this in a way that you actually did around the Epstein files and even what we were talking about with the FCC overreach. Again, the Trump administration is taking major hits because of these very unpopular policy positions. So, they're 100% on the back foot when it comes to ICE and immigration enforcement. Trump just hit new lows in four major polls, Quinnipak, Yahoo, NBC, and the AP. He's doing way worse than Joe Biden was. If the election were held today and the Ras</p>
<p>Mucin pollster, who's a right-leaning pollster, even said this, Joe Biden would win. He's now at minus 27 with independence. You cannot win an election at minus 27 with independents, bleeding non-ol support. He was even down two points with white voters. And Democrats haven't won white voters since 1964. So I'm not saying that that poll, it was a Quantis poll. It's a good pollster that we would win white voters, but that's crazy. And now 58% of voters under 30 disapprove of the job Trump's doing. So, every swing category,</p>
<p>Latinos, especially Latino men, young voters, has swung back. And I think you can draw a direct line between what is going on in America's streets and especially in Minneapolis and this change. And we're always looking for a silver lining or something to be hopeful about. And we were talking about this um last week uh with your buddy uh Jeff Sonnenfeld and his new book and how can</p>
<p><strong>[39:22]</strong></p>
<p>you push back and the idea of collective action. The people of Minneapolis have given us a road map. They have shown that you can push back effectively. It's a tragedy what happened with Renee Good and Alex Patty. Of course, I want to talk about that a bit more in terms of what's going on with the ICE. Um, but they will back down if you show up and you peacefully protest and you tell them that this isn't all right. This isn't American. This is not how we do things here. Tom Hman announcing that the surge is over. A small security force is going</p>
<p>to remain. That's a win for our side. And I think that we should recognize that and know that it is going to take every one of us who feels, you know, distraught, disturbed, incensed, angry, livid over what's going on, that you may have to show up for a protest or two, that you may have to push back in any way that you can, that you may have to resist and unsubscribe. Um, but that you can make change and you're not powerless. >> Yeah, I agree with you. I think that they picked the wrong state, right? And</p>
<p>I do think it's mobilized people. And to be bereft and believe that we're the first generation to face this type of behavior or a dark time, it just doesn't understand or or really have any historical context. There we have absolutely faced worse predicaments than this. Whether it's civil wars, world wars, plagues, interning Japanese people, you know, we civil rights violations, not mentioning the word AIDS because you think it's such, you know, gay people are such an</p>
<p>abomination. We have we have faced very big crises and every time Americans have uh equaled the moment and the fear this time is that we have become so fat and happy and so prosperous that we take our institutions and our rights for granted. And I don't think that's happening here. And I think the people of Minnesota have kind of, as you've said, have kind of provided a great example and sort of led the way here. The trust in government, it's just so upsetting. Just 17% of Americans now say they trust the</p>
<p>government in Washington to do what is right. Just about always is 2% and most of the time is 15%. Now get this. That's 17% versus in 1958 73% of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing. always most of the time. Uh by 1980, post Vietnam and Watergate, only a quarter of Americans expressed a high level of trust, but it's still double what it is now. Uh as the economy grew in the late '9s, trust in government also rose. It also rose after 9/11 and then fell after 2008. Uh</p>
<p>twothirds of Americans report having not very much or no trust in Congress. So there's just a lack again of faith in our in our institutions. You said something earlier in the show I want to double click on and that is quite frankly unless we i.e. Democrats [ __ ] this up and we are famous at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory sea above start ship posting</p>
<p><strong>[42:23]</strong></p>
<p>each other instead of actually focusing on the real adversary here but you had said something it looks as if we're going to take back Congress. you had said that now there's some credible pollsters specifically the predictions markets saying there's not a non-zero probability that we actually take the Senate. Do you have any thoughts on that? And you can be can you be more specific about which Senate seats might be in play that weren't before? >> Yeah, I mean so the ones that I I feel really good about uh North Carolina um with Rory Cooper uh running there it I</p>
<p>don't know. I'm so conflicted about what's going on in the main primary. Um, but it does feel like Susan Collins is more vulnerable than she is usually. And I was someone who thought that there was a chance that she was going to lose uh 6 years ago and she won by double digits. Um, but it does feel like the mood is we need a change. Janet Mills, who's the current governor running for Senate in the Democratic primary, had a brutal,</p>
<p>awesome ad um about, you know, how concerned Susan Collins has been for decades and how she really does nothing about it. And she also, like many politicians, said, you know, not going to serve for some absurd amount of time. I think it was just two terms, but she's been in there now, I think, like 30 years. Um, so that's pretty hard-hitting. But it seems like Graham Platner the you know the lefty candidate in there has a lot of enthusiasm um on the ground and that's the you know this fight between the younger generation and</p>
<p>the old guard is definitely coming into play. Um Ohio is really interesting. I love shared Brown. He is you know the workingclass warrior uh that we all uh adore and you know probably the only candidate who I think could win that Ohio seat back. um linking this to what we were just talking about with Epstein. The guy who he's running against, John Hustad, I think that's how you pronounce it, apparently took $100,000 from Epstein. And now Sherid Brown is featuring that in his ads. And that'll be interesting to see. I think it's the only one in the country, at least um on</p>
<p>the congressional or Senate level, where we're talking about a potential Epstein angle um to it, and we'll see how unpopular that actually makes you. Um, so I think Ohio is, you know, it's a red state now, but Chered Brown is the guy who could do it. Um, you know, Texas I still think is a total pipe dream, um, to be able to do that. And people are really interested in what's going on in Iowa. Um, I was, you know, Rob Sand who's running for governor, feeling good. Nathan Sage just dropped out of the Democratic primary on the Senate</p>
<p>side and endorsed Josh Turk, uh, who is a very cool and interesting candidate. It has an amazing story. Um, so you know, those are just some places I guess that I'm paying attention, but it is the first time that I've felt like there could be a blue wave. You know, Brian and I have been having those conversations like every young, you know, set of parents. Where would it be</p>
<p><strong>[45:25]</strong></p>
<p>better to live, right? Like >> where would it be better to raise kids? I know that you're a big proponent of the Florida model. Um, I couldn't live in Florida under a Governor Dantis. I I just couldn't get there. But it was the first time that I even allowed myself to say, well, like what if David Jolly did win, right? Like what what if it is such a big blue wave that you have a Democrat in the governor's mansion in Florida? Does that change calculus about being in a state like that? And I think that it does. I I'm not I'm not predicting that we have that big of a wave, but those</p>
<p>conversations don't feel insane to people when you're flipping Trump plus 25 seats, right? in states like Texas and Louisiana. Um, you know, the map is getting bluer and it's lighting up brighter and Democrats at this moment have the enthusiasm on our side showing up for these special elections. We're going to show up on election day. The question will be, you know, what Trump on the trail will do. I happen to think it's just going to make us show up more because he's like that big flashing sign</p>
<p>that we just can't stand. and midterm voters um on the right don't tend to be as passionate as certainly the party that's trying to get back into power. Um but that's I guess my overview. >> So you mentioned Florida and obviously that's I'm I'm a resident of Florida. What do you think of a matchup between Lieutenant Colonel Vinman who's announced he's running in the Democratic primary for the special election seat for Rubio seat versus the AG appointed to Rubio Senate seat by Governor Dantis?</p>
<p>Do you think Vinman has a shot? >> I have not looked at polling on that. I think the Vinman's um both of them are very compelling characters. I don't know. It's a tough one because in a lot of ways I think that they're or he's representative of, you know, a conversation about democracy and the rule of law and >> like a lot of those lines of argumentation that we didn't win on previously if you do you know what I'm saying? So</p>
<p>>> that part is tough for me. Um, but ethically, morally speaking, like the kind of person that I would like to see uh going to Washington. Yeah, 100%. I think that's great. But, you know, it's interesting to see Dantis, who was really on the outs with Trump, obviously challenging him in the last primary, Meatball Ron, I think is what he called him. Apparently, he was playing golf with Trump just a few days ago. And you can see a move to bring the coalition</p>
<p>back together. Trump is not picking as many fights internally as he was, except if you speak out about the Epstein files. Like he's endorsing everybody in these primaries instead of picking sides. Um, and I think Ashley Moody will definitely appeal to a lot of normies. She's an establishment favorite kind of person. And there are still a lot of</p>
<p><strong>[48:25]</strong></p>
<p>Republicans out there that are begging for a world in which there's a return to normaly. I think just as people underestimate Governor Nuome, I think they underestimate Governor DeSantis. I think you learn a lot running a campaign. You have an infrastructure that could be fired up pretty easily. He comes across I think he's I think he comes across as more of a leader than either Rubio or Vance. Um I I I would not count him out. And with respect to Inman, I think he's an American hero. I follow Florida politics semi- closely. Unfortunately, I think it's going to be</p>
<p>an impeachment nostalgia campaign, and I don't think that's what Flityians care about. I think unfortunately that race is going to be won or lost on boring [ __ ] like uh insurance, which a third of Florida homeowners can't get right now, and HOA fees that have skyrocketed and seniors are having to give up their condos because of regulation. I mean, it's basically you have millions and millions of people in Florida who move down there thinking they'd spend the rest of their lives down there who are having to sell their homes and leave because of uh the insurance market has</p>
<p>totally turned against them and because of um HOA fe I mean it's just it sounds I'm bored talking about it but I think that is what's going to >> well that's what wins elections right in your day-to-day life. >> Yeah. I think there'll be a lot of great ads about Lieutenant Colonel Linman and his his uniform and talking about how brave he is. And that's not what that's not what's going to turn people out. People are going to think, "Okay, >> well, it's a great side dish, but the entree has to be >> improving to lower your cost of living</p>
<p>to make sure you have the insurance that you need." I was actually we last year I interviewed David Jolly for the pod who's running on the Democratic side uh for >> governor and he kept emphasizing that because you know he's a Republican turned Democrat and that's the story that people like us always want to talk about like you know when did it hit you that the Republicans are so evil right that you had to come over to the other side and he was like I've got a plan to lower people's taxes right to make sure that you can afford a home like that's what people are showing up for it is a</p>
<p>luxury to be a quote unquote democracy voter unless you can connect the dots, which I think that we can, between the assault on democracy and your cost of living cuz that is available through the tariffs and all of these abuses with what's going on with immigration enforcement because immigrants make us more prosperous. They make the and they make the country better. They are a net contributor, right? They are the ones who are actually paying more into the system. But you're you're totally right. will be paying attention to the campaign as it uh rolls out. But Vinman is a hero</p>
<p>who needs an insurance plan. >> There you go. >> Like for actual insurance, not like cuz something's going to happen to it. >> All right, before we go, if you're watching us on YouTube, please make sure you hit subscribe.
