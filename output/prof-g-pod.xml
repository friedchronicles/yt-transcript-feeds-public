      <title>DISGRACED Former Prince Andrew ARRESTED over Epstein SCANDAL</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mlC47TREug</link>
      <description>Jessica Tarlov and Aaron Parnas (@aaronparnas1) break down a stunning development across the pond: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, has been arrested in the U.K. on suspicion of misconduct in public office tied to his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. British authorities are reportedly investigating whether he shared confidential trade information with Epstein after Epstein’s 2008 conviction — raising questions about potential national security implications. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice is under fire after reports that key FBI interview records tied to one of Donald Trump’s accusers were deleted from the Epstein files. The contrast couldn’t be sharper: while Trump and those in his administration continue to evade accountability in the U.S., King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are insisting that no one is above the law. Survivors’ families call this long overdue. Could this finally mark the start of real consequences for the so-called “Epstein class”?

      <title>The Epstein Class is FINALLY Being Held Accountable (ft. Nancy Pelosi)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmVI3sAzqLk</link>
      <description>Jessica Tarlov sits down with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi to discuss Trump’s corruption, safeguarding the election, rising tensions with Iran, and Congress’s constitutional role before any potential military strike. Fresh off the Munich Security Conference, Pelosi reflects on NATO, human rights, and America’s standing with its allies. They also examine the arrest of Prince Andrew and the fallout from the Epstein files, debating whether Democrats should target the “Epstein class” or keep their focus on affordability and immigration. From redistricting battles and fears of election denialism 2.0 to shutdown brinkmanship over ICE reforms and unfinished business on healthcare costs, Pelosi weighs in on the strategy ahead — plus her most iconic moments and whether she’ll attend her final State of the Union.

      <title>BREAKING: Supreme Court STRIKES DOWN Trump’s Tariffs – What Happens Now?</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFvRsMldyDY</link>
      <description>The Supreme Court struck down Trump’s tariff regime. What does this mean for the American economy? Does this mean tariffs are gone for good, or just for now? Are refunds on the way? 

Jessica Tarlov and Scott Galloway are here to talk through it. They talk about who the real winners and losers are, the politics of what comes next, and what American consumers can expect.

      <title>Trump’s “FORGETTABLE” Speech Was a DISASTER and DANGEROUS</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS63-flw5x4</link>
      <description>Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov break down Trump’s marathon State of the Union — the longest in history — and the alternate reality he painted of a “golden age” America, even as most voters say the country is on the wrong track. They dig into the speech’s biggest moments: the attacks on Democrats, the swipe at the Supreme Court over tariffs, and Trump’s mixed message on Iran — diplomacy, but with the door wide open to military action. Did the speech help him? And are we actually edging toward war? Then, the Democratic split screen. From Abigail Spanberger’s affordability-focused rebuttal to protests inside and outside the chamber — the party showed unity in opposition to Trump, but real divisions on strategy heading into the midterms. Finally, the Pentagon’s escalating clash with AI firm Anthropic. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is threatening to invoke the Defense Production Act unless the company lifts restrictions on how its models can be used by the military.

 The Democrats’ fractured response
