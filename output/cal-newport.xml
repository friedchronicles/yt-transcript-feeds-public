<h2>Why it&#x27;s important to read books</h2>
<p>Why is it important to read books? So, let&#x27;s look at some quotes from this article. There&#x27;s a lot of different things going on here. And I&#x27;ve pulled some quotes out of here, not in their order that they appeared, but in the order that I think they&#x27;re important to our discussion. So, let me grab the first quote I want to start with here. All right. Here is Maryanne. And again, I have this on the screen. If you&#x27;re at youtube.com/calport media, this is episode 238. All right. So let&#x27;s start with this quote. No human was born to read.</p>
<p>Literacy requires a new plastic brain circuit. Plasticity allows the circuit to adapt to any writing system and any medium. The catch is that circuits reflect a medium&#x27;s charact characteristics whatever they are. So we&#x27;ll start with this point. It&#x27;s a big point that was made in P and the squid. Humans aren&#x27;t meant to read. It&#x27;s a highly unnatural activity. We hijack significant portions of our brain that were originally evolved to do other things and we retrain them to do this reading this reading activity that humans invented. It&#x27;s a cultural innovation that&#x27;s relatively recent in the history of our species. But what</p>
<p>Maryanne is saying here is we&#x27;re reshaping our brain to this new activity. So specific the specifics of this activity matter. So what we&#x27;re reading, how we&#x27;re reading it, what format we&#x27;re reading in actually can have an impact on how the brain is shaped. All right. Second quote I want to read here. This is now about let&#x27;s dive into how different mediums can affect how our brain is shaped around reading. The medium of print advantages slower, more attention and time</p>
<p>requiring processes. The digital medium, by contrast, advantages fast processes and multitasking. Uh, both well suited for skimming information&#x27;s daily bombardments. Marian has a little interesting piece here where she says, &quot;Stop for a moment and think about that sentence you just read. Did you really read the whole sentence or did you skim and bounce around some words?&quot; Because as she goes on to clarify, that&#x27;s really how we engage with words on screens and web browsers, on social media, etc. We skim,</p>
<p>we jump around. There&#x27;s things called Z patterns and F patterns. We&#x27;ll read the first line to middle section. We our eyes jump around. We feel like we&#x27;re going fast, but we&#x27;re missing a lot of information. So, different types of reading, digital verse physical,</p>
<h2>Different types of reading</h2>
<p>requires different types of processes. Um, so does this matter? Well, let&#x27;s see. Here&#x27;s what Maryannne says. To skim to inform, as we do when we read on digital, is the new norm for reading. What goes missing, however, are deep reading processes, which require a quality of attention increasingly at risk in a culture and on a medium in which constant distraction bifurcates our attention. These processes include connecting background knowledge to new information, making analogies, drawing</p>
<p>inferences, examining truth value, passing over into the perspectives of other, expanding our empathy and knowledge and integration and critical analysis. Here is the the key quote about summarizing all these things we get from reading a physical book. Deep reading is our species bridge to insight and novel thought. All right. So, let&#x27;s think about what they&#x27;re saying. What what Maryannne is saying here. We have to reshape our brain to read. If we&#x27;re reading on a screen, we tend to</p>
<p>do what she calls skim to inform. We jump around and uh see ideas, try to get the gist of what&#x27;s going on. When we instead read on a physical page, we instead are prioritizing processes that give us all of these all of these advanced human cognition behaviors. Here&#x27;s where we get the analogies, inferences, truth, value, passing over perspective, empathetic, putting ourselves into the shoes of others, integration, critical analysis, the things that she describes as our bridge to insight and novel thought. As Maryanne Wolf goes on to summarize</p>
<p>those traits we get from physical books but not digital. To deploy these interactive processes requires nearly automatic decoding skills and purposeful attention that moves as William James once put it from flight to purchase for thought. Imperceptible pauses and reading can lead to lightning speed leaps in our thoughts furthest reaches. By contrast, when we skim, we literally physiologically don&#x27;t have time to think or feel. So, this is a a big a big idea that&#x27;s</p>
<p>being made here. Slowly reading full sentences one after a time as we do when we look at a physical page is supporting and kicking off all of these incredibly advanced deep thinking processes that are at the key of what makes humans human. And it&#x27;s not just being able to think clear. It&#x27;s also being able to be more empathetic. It&#x27;s being able to integrate the ideas you&#x27;re seeing into other ideas. What she&#x27;s emphasizing here is just the ability to pause and just think for a moment about that sentence before you move on to the next allows you to integrate it successfully into</p>
<p>existing structures of thought. Therefore, growing a much more sophisticated understanding of the world. All of this comes from the pace of reading. The style of reading that happens on physical pages. On a screen, on a phone, on an iPad, we don&#x27;t get that. We&#x27;re skimming around and we literally physiologically don&#x27;t have time to think or feel. So, we&#x27;re not able to integrate the thoughts we&#x27;re reading. We&#x27;re not able to examine them successfully for truth value or understand how they fit in or challenge existing schemas. We do not have the physiological or psychological space for empathy for the other people. So, what</p>
<p>we look for is uh arousal. Hey, this makes me mad. This makes me laugh. This makes me, you know, excited about something. This makes me, you know, scared. Emotional arousal kind of captures our attention and we look for key words about do I like this person or not? Is this on my team? Do I agree with this idea or not? It&#x27;s a primitive engagement with information. Does this affect other types of thinking? So if we spend most of our time reading in a digital screen instead of reading on a physical screen, will that impact the way we think not just</p>
<p>when we&#x27;re engaging with text, but when we&#x27;re trying to do other type of thinking in other aspects of our life? Here the article provides evidence that yes, the answer there is yes. Maryanne points towards a recent study that was published in Jamba Pediatrics by a group of researchers from Singapore, McGill and Harvard. It looked at over 500 young children. And what they found is increased screen time at a young age was associated with weaker development of the brain regions responsible for the executive function skills that govern</p>
<p>attention impulse inhibition and some aspects of memory. So they&#x27;re not getting the cognitive training that book reading in physical books gives you. And without the training you&#x27;re not developing those skills. So, it&#x27;s not just the act of reading itself while you&#x27;re reading allows you to do this deeper thinking. It&#x27;s cognitive strength training. It&#x27;s making those parts of your brains able to do that type of thinking better in the future when you&#x27;re doing other cognitive activities. Now, is this just for young kids? Well, no. Maryanne goes</p>
<p>on to say, &quot;This same sentence, she&#x27;s referencing a sentence that summarized what I just said, could as easily describe the experience of older children and indeed adults.&quot; So to me, these are important points. Reading a physical book in a slow,</p>
<h2>Reading physical books</h2>
<p>deliberative, and careful manner sharpens a type of innovative, empathetic, creative, and critical thinking that is otherwise hard for humans to access. It requires us to literally rewire our brain to do that type of thinking. And without a concerted effort, we will not develop those skills. If we avoid the slow and deliberate reading of actual physical books, if we mainly consume information on screens, constantly keeping up with the news, on Twitter, looking at what&#x27;s going on on Instagram, jumping around highly engaging websites or</p>
<p>following links on social media. Even very highly educated people will do this and convince themselves, I&#x27;m really up on things. I know what&#x27;s going on. I&#x27;m jumping back and forth between these Substack quotes that I saw quoted on other tweets. you feel like you&#x27;re really engaged, but you&#x27;re not doing the type of reading that supports innovative, empathetic, creative, and critical thinking. So, what happens is the sophistication with which you understand and later make sense of information is decreased, and your ability to apply sophisticated thinking in other contexts is also atrophied. Avoiding books is like being in ancient</p>
<p>Sparta and avoiding doing any physical training. you&#x27;re going to be bad at the main activity that your civilization prioritizes. For the Spartans, it was physical war. For us, it&#x27;s cognition. You&#x27;re making yourself much worse at that if you avoid physical books. Now, if we think about this even more literally and we we go with this idea that Wolf pushes that training our brain to do this type of innovative and empathetic and creative and critical thinking is something that&#x27;s unnatural. We have to</p>
<p>hijack huge portions of our brain and doing this very difficult unnatural activity that is sitting there and holding a codeex and trying to decode the sentences that we have to do something incredibly unnatural again and again to train our brains to be this higher order of human. If we&#x27;re not doing that, if we&#x27;re substituting that time with screens, we are in a literal sense evolving our brain backwards towards our pre-iterate tribal selves. We&#x27;re going backwards to the type of brains we had before the advent of literacy and the impact that had on the plastic formation of how our brain actually</p>
<p>functions. I spent all day last Wednesday sick on the internet and here was my uh my conclusion. It&#x27;s a terrible place. Seriously, there&#x27;s no empathy. The thinking is simplistic. there is a automatic knee-jerk meanness to any perceived outsiders. In other words, if you&#x27;re bouncing around Twitter and social media and substack fights going back and forth, it&#x27;s a digital paleolithic tribe. And so, exactly what Wolf would predict, if you don&#x27;t do this</p>
<p>effort that makes us more than our what we used to be, we&#x27;re going to go right back to what we used to be. And when I see Twitter today or what 10 years ago would have been Tumblr fighting with 4chan uh and before that, you know, who knows? Um what I see there is the human brain going backwards. It&#x27;s going back to where it&#x27;s comfortable. Where&#x27;s my tribe? How does this make me feel? Who&#x27;s the bad guy? I want to feel something big right now. And when we do that, we get away from</p>
<p>what characterizes and distinguishes humans, the modern human from any other any other animal or beast that&#x27;s ever come before. You know, Aristotle identified in the Nikmachian ethics concentrated deep thought, the ability to sit here and manipulate ideas just within our head as the essence of what it means to be human, what separates humans, art, our teological end point. So to voluntarily move backwards from that is something that we should be cautious of. All right. So I&#x27;m being pretty philosophical here. Let&#x27;s get</p>
<p>more concrete. What is my recommendation for, you know, my listeners here to the show? I think we need to think about a serious reading habit as an exceptional activity, one that you need to isolate and support and really prioritize in your life. No matter what else you think is important in your personal definition of a deep life. I&#x27;m increasingly convinced, the serious reading of good books needs to be in there. So, I have seven suggestions I want to give. Seven suggestions about integrating real</p>
<p>reading into your life. All right.</p>
<h2>7 suggestions to integrate reading</h2>
<p>Number one, uh always be reading something challenging. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s fiction or non-fiction, but something that&#x27;s challenging. uh ideas you have to grapple with, characters whose psychological reality is uh difficult or pushes you into new psychological or emotional places like in fiction, but challenging. Number two, read real books, not on a phone, not on an iPad. Kindle, I think, is okay. We&#x27;re going to get into this later with a question later in the the program. We</p>
<p>have a good collection of questions coming up, but for now, I&#x27;ll just say Kindle&#x27;s okay. Physical books are okay. Don&#x27;t read on your phone. Don&#x27;t read on your iPad. Wolf goes into this in this article. It&#x27;s where the other distractions are, and you&#x27;re going to read in those old ways. If you&#x27;re trying to read on those same devices, you&#x27;re going to read in the skim style. Number three, uh, read when possible in awesome, awe inspiring locations. I don&#x27;t like this mindset that reading is a take your cod liver oil type of grin and barrett ice bath type self- flagagillation behavior. Make it awesome. It&#x27;s sunny out. I&#x27;m going to go to a park and sit on a bench or hike</p>
<p>into the woods for 20 minutes and bring a book by, you know, thorough read at a coffee shop in the morning or as I would occasionally do when I lived in Beacon Hill for a while when I was at MIT, go to a pub. That&#x27;s it. We we The British are great at this. Americans are terrible at this. The the art of being a grad student that has a book that&#x27;s a little bit too hard, but you have a hefty in a back corner of a pub. It&#x27;s great. It opens up. You&#x27;re like, &quot;Great. I&#x27;m excited to read. This feels like the right place to be doing it.&quot; Um, take</p>
<p>your time. This number four. Take your time when you read. Go slow. Seek to understand. If you&#x27;re reading a complicated book, use secondary sources to push yourself. So, read books about the book you&#x27;re reading. It&#x27;ll give you things to look for. It&#x27;ll push your understanding. You&#x27;ll come back to the book and be able to come at it more sophisticated. Again, I&#x27;m not a big believer of just immerse yourself in a complicated thing and and you will just grow. No, don&#x27;t just grab Ulyses. Read a book about Ulyses so you have some understanding of what was going on with modernist English literature in this point. Why is this so important?</p>
<p>What are you looking for? Uh number five, the quantity of books finished in the reading life is less important than the time spent actually reading. So reading regularly, slowly and deliberately is what matters. The quantity of books that translates to will depend on two things. One, happen stance, the length of the books you happen to be reading. And two, just as your skill increases, as you get better at reading, you might finish books faster. Uh, six, keep notes. Keep notes. When you are tackling an</p>
<p>idea that&#x27;s important, maybe you&#x27;ve read multiple books on it, start a document somewhere, keep notes. This helps you practice, puts you in the mindset of, I&#x27;m not just reading the sentences. I want to actually try to extract information from these sentences. You&#x27;re going to slow down. You&#x27;re going to allow those purchase for thought that William James talked about that pause in between that allows you to say, &quot;hm, what was said here reminds me of what was said there.&quot; and it changes the way I think about what I wrote the other day. That&#x27;s where real interesting synthesis happens. And finally, to support all of this reading, when it</p>
<p>comes to your life with screens, especially phones and iPads, try to reduce the use of screens as a default response to boredom. That should be a plan thing. It&#x27;s okay if you say tonight I&#x27;m going to watch a show uh that I&#x27;m going to stream or there was a baseball game today and at breakfast I am going to check on this site that site and this site to get the analysis of what happened there. That&#x27;s perfectly fine. What you want to avoid is when I&#x27;m bored, whip this out. Hey uh Tik Tok algorithm or Twitter social</p>
<p>dynamic, show me some stuff that makes me feel big. That you want to avoid. You want your brain to not crave that so much. You want your brain to be more comfortable with not having the big feelings at all moments so that when it comes time to do deep reading, it doesn&#x27;t complain. All right, so that&#x27;s my advice. So here&#x27;s my summary here. The reading life is a deep life. The screen life, the screen fil life can be downright primitive. Which one do you want? Hey, if you like this video, I think you&#x27;ll really like this one as well. Check it</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last year, when columnist Paul Krugman left the NYT, it seemed like yet another example of the traditional media crumbling. But Krugman, as it turns out, is doing great. His popular substack now reaches massive audiences and earns him a seven-figure salary. Inspired by this story, in the ideas segment of today’s episode we take a closer look at key numbers relevant to the question of whether paid newsletters can replace traditional print media. Then, in the practices segment, we study some viral advice for spending less time on your phone.

<h2>Can Substack Save Journalism? + Viral Advice for Ignoring Your Phone</h2>
<p>Right around this time last year, one of the big stories in the world of media was the announcement that the economist and columnist Paul Krugman was leaving the New York Times. I&#x27;m going to load here on the screen for people who are watching one of the articles from around this period. You can see the headline was Paul Krugman on leaving the New York Times and the subhead says the paper wanted to take away his newsletter or make him write less frequently. He says, uh, it goes on to summarize that Krugman was fed up with that. He felt like he was being pushed out and he left. Now,</p>
<p>at the time when this all went down last year, I took it as yet another example of this sort of slow motion dismantling of traditional media that we have been seeing during the entire era of the internet&#x27;s rise. I mean, in an age of digital distraction, the business model for traditional media is really struggling to compete, right? Because on your phone, information is free and distraction is powerful. And if you want to know about your about the news, your phone can deliver you dozens of algor algorithmically curated takes that are</p>
<p>reduced down to pathy tweets or compelling short-term videos to make you feel like you&#x27;re in the middle of all sorts of action. It&#x27;s just more interesting and more accessible than a lot of traditional media. So it feels like the age in which experts like Paul Krugman attempt to make careful sense of events in the pages of print publications is rapidly disappearing and that in its place is emerging a world in which all truth and expertise are vanishing. All information is becoming entertainment. All realities are becoming equally valid. But then more recently I came across something interesting. I was having</p>
<p>coffee with someone uh who knows Krugman and he told me like look after the after the times after he left the times Krookman started up a Substack which you know you might think of like oh that&#x27;s kind of sad it&#x27;s like the once famous TV personality now has the sort of low-rated podcast or whatever but here&#x27;s what my source told me no you don&#x27;t understand Paul is killing it his subscriber count rivals the times as Sunday print circulation he&#x27;s really impacting the conversation And according to my source, his earnings have leaped comfortably into the seven</p>
<p>figure range. This is interesting to me because so often our narratives about the battle for depth in a distracted world are pessimistic. But in Krugsman Krugman&#x27;s tale, I see the glimmer of a perhaps more optimistic storyline. Is it possible that paid email newsletter subscriptions might be the foundation on which we can build a new type of professional journalism? Can a distributed network of respected and expert thinkers delivering thoughts in long form essays offer competition</p>
<p>to the nonsense and slop being delivered through attention economy apps? Or is Krookman just an outlier? uh one last harrah of old media expertise being turned into money and the slide immediate towards Tik Tok is all but inevitable. These are the questions that we are going to tackle today in our ideas segment and we are going to do so by looking carefully at the underlying numbers behind this story. It will help explain both what&#x27;s going on in this new type of media and how it compares to what is going on or was going on in the</p>
<p>old. We spent a lot of time tracking down these numbers, so I think you&#x27;re going to find uh some pretty interesting insights hidden in there. And then after we&#x27;re done with that, we&#x27;re going to try something a little bit new. I&#x27;m experimenting with adding a practices segment to the show in which we explore practical ideas that you can consider in your own personal fight for depth in an increasingly distracted world. So, in today&#x27;s practice practices segment, we will look closer at some advice for ignoring your phone that has recently gone viral online. We&#x27;ll try to figure out what&#x27;s going on there. All right, so we got a lot to cover. As always, I&#x27;m</p>
<p>Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about the fight for depth in an increasingly distracted world. And we&#x27;ll get started right after the music. All right. All right. So, what I&#x27;ve done here to try to structure our exploration of these questions is I&#x27;ve broken them out into a series of questions. We think of like sub questions on my own. So,</p>
<p>let&#x27;s start with sub question number one. What actually is Paul Krugman doing? Let&#x27;s take a closer look at that. So, what I want to do here is load up on the screen for people who are watching just listening. This is Paul Krugman&#x27;s Substack. I&#x27;ve loaded it up in the Substack app uh where we can see what he&#x27;s up to. There&#x27;s a couple key numbers in here um that I want to point out. One, the subscriber count 505,000. Uh, two, his ranking on here is number six in US politics. And three, if we look at this, we see the post frequency is quite regular. So, his latest post</p>
<p>was from 7 hours ago as recording this. The post before that was from a day ago. The post before that was from two days ago. The post before that was three days ago. So, he&#x27;s posting every day. Let&#x27;s look at a sample quote post. Um, I&#x27;m loading up his post from uh the day we&#x27;re recording this. It&#x27;s called Day of Infamy. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t a bad dream. So, this this came out on January 6, so it&#x27;s about January 6. And if we look at it, um, it&#x27;s very short, right? Two paragraphs and a sentence. He&#x27;s just making some quick uh, observations. Now, he says at the beginning here, &quot;Travel</p>
<p>day yesterday, so no time for a full-scale post, but I want to acknowledge this anniversary.&quot; All right, let&#x27;s look at another one. Here&#x27;s from the day before. This one is titled The Real Donro. The real Don Row doctrine, seeking cash and an ego boost, not regime change. This is about uh the Trump administration&#x27;s uh assault on Venezuela. This just you can see this is a longer post, right? And it&#x27;s not super long, but this is like a good,200word post. There&#x27;s a musical kod at the end, which is fun. He has a table in here where you can see some numbers and uh a bunch of links to relevant information. So, he&#x27;s just</p>
<p>trying to make sense of what was happening in the news. Uh, what is his subscription setup? Well, I&#x27;m going to click on Oh, you&#x27;re Are you already subscribed? Let&#x27;s &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m a follower. I&#x27;m not subscribed. So, let&#x27;s click on upgrade to see the answer. Okay. So, here we go. So, here are the options. If you want to subscribe, it&#x27;s uh $7 a month uh or $7 a year. All right. So, what you get on here, it says the the free gives you occasional public post. And if you go to $7 a month, you get subscriber only post and the full archive. And you can post comments. Um, I looked at this earlier.</p>
<p>It looks like at the moment he&#x27;s posting every day and only one post a week is subscriber only. So, you get a lot of content even if you&#x27;re not a subscriber. But for $7 a month, you will get uh all of the post and you can participate in the uh comments. All right. So, here&#x27;s the question then we want to ask. Let&#x27;s start with um how much money is he actually making? So, how do we figure that out? out. We want if we want to understand the Substack economy, the newsletter economy, let&#x27;s use this example first. Is it true that he&#x27;s making seven figures? Well, we need to</p>
<p>dive into the numbers here. So, I&#x27;m going to start with what Substack itself, the formula that Substack itself says to use. We look this up and Substack says for, you know, a standard newsletter with a free tier and a paid tier, you can expect somewhere between 5 to 10% of your subscribers to pay for the paid tier. The low end of that would be more like 3%. All right. So, I&#x27;m going to load up here a table that we put together. And what we have here in the the far left column is we have a row for different percents, right? So, different percents of the um</p>
<p>so let me move that different percents of the subscribers that might have converted to pay. Right? We don&#x27;t know the answer for Krugman, but we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll look at three different scenarios. Okay? 10% of his total subscribers paying 5% and 3%. Then for each we can calculate how many paid subscribers would that percent give us, how much monthly income that would then translate to. And then what does that shake out to per year? To simplify things here. I&#x27;m not taking out um Substacks cut, but we could just, you know, reduce it by 10% if you wanted to do that. All right, so let&#x27;s look at the the the</p>
<p>really optimistic scenario for Krugman, which is that 10% of his 500,000 subscribers are paying for the tier. That would mean 10. He would have 50,000 paid subscribers in that case. 10% of 500,000 which would work out good work if you can get it, Jesse. $350,000 a month uh of subscript subscription fees, which is a little over $4 million a year. All right, so let&#x27;s look at the lower end of the range that uh Substack said to expect, which would be 5% of your subscribers pay. That would work out to be about 25,000 paid subscribers,</p>
<p>which is $175,000 a month and a little over $2 million a year of income. Even if we jump down to the pessimistic scenario where only 3% of his his subscribers pay, um that&#x27;s still going to be 15,000 paid subscribers, which is $105,000 per month of subscriber fees, which is about $1.26 26 million of a a um average revenue. All right. So the answer to our first question, what has Paul Kman been doing</p>
<p>is we can say look in every reasonable scenario his 7day a week Substack has him doing much better financially than he could have been doing at the New York Times. And if he&#x27;s in the best case scenario, uh he is actually building up real wealth. He&#x27;s making many millions of dollars a year. All right. Uh, second question in our investigation, how much does a newsletter like this um actually require to run? Is this easy? Is it hard? They get some insight here.</p>
<p>Uh, we don&#x27;t have Krugman himself talking in too much detail about his habits, but we have a a similar blogger, not blogger, I guess, newsletter writer they would say, who did write about the process. Uh there&#x27;s this article I&#x27;ll put on the screen here for people who are watching. Nate Silver, who I think when I looked it up was ranked number 12 on the substax pol substax politics leaderboard as compared to number seven for Krugman. So they&#x27;re very similar size um substackers. Uh Silver wrote this article, always be blogging, my seven tips for a successful substack.</p>
<p>So, we can look at Silver&#x27;s article to get a sense of like what actually goes in to being uh someone who has a lot of subscribers like him or Paul Krugman on Substack. So, he has seven pieces of advice. Uh number one, we&#x27;ll go through them real quick. Always be blogging. He says, &quot;I have to tell you that producing Silver Bolton is really hard work. It&#x27;s often creatively fulfilling and enjoyable. And this year, it was financially rewarding, but professionally, I&#x27;m the happiest been in years, but it&#x27;s a lot of work. And if you scroll down here a little bit more, uh, he says he keeps in mind, he has a</p>
<p>picture here of Alec Baldwin from Glengary, Glenn Ross with the always be closing, uh, chalkboard and he&#x27;s changed the last, uh, C to a B, so it now reads always be blogging. Like, you got to be writing a lot, right? That&#x27;s what if you want to have a large subscriber base and a good conversion to paid, he&#x27;s saying you have to write, um, a lot at a minimum three articles a week. How long does that take? Um, well, he says, uh, if you ask me to chart out how I spent my time, uh, in the way that the American time you survey does, you&#x27;ll</p>
<p>find that I&#x27;m not actually working all that often. Uh, sure, 40 or 50 hours a week, but I take most nights off from work. I travel a lot, both for work and for fun. I play a lot of poker, a wonderful but time intensive habit, and I have my share of weekday leisurely lunches. I do tend to put in some working hours on the weekend, mornings, afternoon. Still, it&#x27;s not a crazy schedule. First of all, Jesse, can I just put a little aside here about like the elite class of knowledge workers? In his mind, he&#x27;s like, &quot;Look, I know this isn&#x27;t really a hard job. I&#x27;m just working 50 hours a week.&quot; Because, you know, he came out of, you know, he was</p>
<p>running, he was at the New York Times, and then ESPN put all this money into him building out this giant uh vertical that did sports and and election predictions. When you&#x27;re in those situations, you&#x27;re just working all the time. &gt;&gt; Mhm. So he&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, I know it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m working all the time because I&#x27;m not working at night.&quot; I think for people in that class, that&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m lazy.&quot; But I think the key number in here is 40 to 50 hours a work week. So it takes about like a normal full-time job. A normal person full-time job. The other tips I&#x27;ll go through quickly. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re a little bit less um important, but</p>
<p>they&#x27;re kind of interesting. All right. His second advice if you want to succeed at uh Substack is to stretch singles into doubles. So is you got to know how you have like a good idea, how to make it a great idea, make the headline better, a better lead, like a better image, like that matters. Uh three, he says home runs come from timely differentiated content. I definitely have seen that on Substack. So you need the article if it&#x27;s timely to something that&#x27;s actually happening in the world. Like if you&#x27;re a sports writer, there&#x27;s a big thing that just happened like that day in sports and you get it out fast, but you also have a take that&#x27;s</p>
<p>different. If all you&#x27;re doing is like summarizing what&#x27;s going on, then who cares? But if it&#x27;s timely but unique, that&#x27;s where the real numbers pop up. So, he gives a kind of a cool example about this. He says, &quot;The most popular post in Silver Bulletin history uh is the one on an Selzer&#x27;s Iowa poll.&quot; So, this was back from the the presidential election last year. Dubiously and wrongly, so this poll dubiously and wrongly had Camala Harris leading in Iowa, right? So, I don&#x27;t know if you remember this, Jesse, but like this one p poll came out that was like, wait, Kla Harris is doing unexpectedly well in</p>
<p>Iowa. And people were like, &quot;Oh, maybe that&#x27;s a harbinger that she&#x27;s actually doing better than we think because anceler is a good pollster, but she just got it really wrong.&quot; Um, but he wrote a post on this that he claims gave him a different angle. So, if we look at what he actually wrote, a shocking Iowa poll means somebody is going to be wrong. All right, so it was timely and he came at it with an angle of like, wait, someone could be really wrong here. All right. What other advice? Measure twice and cut once. Yeah, you know, um, be prepared. Five, take a nose to tail approach to the newsletter. That&#x27;s just him saying</p>
<p>like maybe you end up cutting something because it wasn&#x27;t working in your post. You might be able to use that in another post like a Q&amp;A or roundup. So, don&#x27;t waste stuff that you already wrote. Um, six, writing well quickly is essential. I I&#x27;ve got that skill, Jesse. I think you would you would admit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Over the years, I have learned how to write. You would be surprised. Some of my email newsletters that seem kind of detailed take me like 45 minutes to write. It&#x27;s just I&#x27;ve been doing it for a long time. And then seven, play the long game, so take time. All right. So, how much work does a newsletter like this require? The answer we learned from Nate Silver, who has a comparable sized</p>
<p>newsletter to Krugman, is that it&#x27;s more or less comparable to like a full-time journalism job. not like a really high-end. I&#x27;m the the publisher of the whole paper, but just like yeah, this is a similar to a job like in the 90s if you commuted to the Houston Chronicle and you worked and you were a journalist and you kind of commuted home in the evening. It&#x27;s like a it&#x27;s not less, but it&#x27;s not a lot more. Um, and it&#x27;s flexible as as Silver says, you can go play poker, do other things because you&#x27;re you are your own boss. All right, we&#x27;re making progress here. We&#x27;re picking apart the numbers. What&#x27;s going</p>
<p>on with the newsletter economy? Question number three I want to tackle. How many other people are making a good living on Substack? All right, this is a a a tricky question and a critical question. Krugman&#x27;s killing it. We crunched the numbers. Uh Silver&#x27;s also killing it. He he&#x27;s a little bit smaller than Krugman, but he&#x27;s doing very well. But are they the only two or are there a huge number of people? This is a a a number that&#x27;s hard to get. Substack doesn&#x27;t like to break this out because it&#x27;s like with uh influencers on</p>
<p>Instagram. They want everyone to think that you never know like you could be rich tomorrow or you&#x27;re only one viral video away. So, they don&#x27;t really talk about these numbers. So, we&#x27;re going to have to try to pick this apart. How many people are actually making this type of making a good living? So, let&#x27;s start with the the narrower question. How many people are making like a Krugman style living million-doll plus income from Substack? I found a reasonable source on this. Let me load this on the page now. It&#x27;s from a website called really good business ideas, but they they they took these numbers from from other sources.</p>
<p>They had a key number in here that I am going to uh scroll down to. Okay, they went through all of the top categories in Substack. And Substack has leaderboards where they order by uh subscriber count the different newsletters and they went by categories and counted how many newsletters in each category had 500,000 or more subscribers. So that is exactly where Paul Krugman is. And remember, we did the math. It said if</p>
<p>you have 500,000 uh unpaid subscribers or total subscribers on Substack, you&#x27;re probably under almost any scenario doing million, if not multi-million dollars a year. All right, so here&#x27;s what they found. I&#x27;ll zoom in this. This is from just last year, so like not long ago. US politics had 15 newsletters with that many subscribers or more. Business had four. Technology had four, three, food, drink, and finance both had two. And then the other categories they looked with all had just one newsletter with 500,000 more or subscribers, which works out to be uh 34</p>
<p>total newsletters they found that were at the Krookman level. All right. So, how many Substack millionaires are there? It&#x27;s like 34. It might be more because if you&#x27;re a little bit below that and you have a good conversion, but like the number of newsletters that are in Paul Krugsman, Paul Krugman&#x27;s category, that&#x27;s pretty small. It&#x27;s, you know, it&#x27;s going to be on the we could think of it as the order of like 50 or so um newsletter subscribers. That&#x27;s not very many people. But let&#x27;s refine this question a little bit more and let&#x27;s ask instead, not how many people are making a million dollars</p>
<p>plus, but let&#x27;s instead ask how many people are making a reasonable living on Substack. And there&#x27;s a lot of ways we could uh we could try to figure this out. like what we mean by reasonable living. Um, but let&#x27;s just try to get a broader understanding here of of how much money are are people making when you&#x27;re below that sort of very top of the heap type of newsletter. So, here&#x27;s the way we went after doing the research for this. We decided we would take uh five main categories. Looked at politics, culture,</p>
<p>technology, business, and finance. So, some of the major categories and some of the smaller categories. And for each what we looked at was the number 20 biggest podcast or newsletter on the leaderboard. So we we wanted to drop down to that 20 spot. Like when you go down 20 spots in these categories, how many subscribers do they have and how much does that work out in terms of um annual money? Because everyone above that spot would be making more. And then you can kind of imagine uh if we&#x27;re doing some sort of distribution that the money will fall</p>
<p>off from there as you head down the list but maybe with some sort of gradualness. Okay. So that that&#x27;s given us a sense if we zoom out now to the top 20 in each of these categories. Where are we? So let me load this on the screen here for people who are watching. Politics is by far the most popular of the categories. The number 20 in the politics category. number uh 20 most popular newsletters. Actually, Angie Sullivan, a DC native. I like Sullivan a lot. He has right around 200,000 subscribers. Um if we use the same numbers from Krugman, I didn&#x27;t want</p>
<p>to look up the individual subscription fees for each. So, let&#x27;s just use uh $7 a month because that&#x27;s like roughly what a lot of sub substackers do. and let&#x27;s use the moderate prediction uh with the lower end of Substack&#x27;s expectation and what we would think of as the moderate prediction of a 5% conversion that would lead to uh in Angie Sullivan&#x27;s case $840,000 a year. Now, I think that&#x27;s probably accurate because I heard him multiple years ago talk about his shift over to Substack and when he f he was saying something like at the time, I&#x27;m making $600,000 a year or more. This is</p>
<p>great. Why would I ever go back to magazine journalism? So probably like 840 now. That makes sense. I would guess he&#x27;s probably actually over a million because he has a high conversion rate. All right, the culture category. Now this is slightly less popular. The 20th biggest newsletter had 130,000 subscribers. That works out to about $550,000 a year. And with our assumptions when we get to technology now, the 20th biggest only has 95,000 subscribers. But with our assumptions, that still works out to around $400,000 a year. In business, interestingly, you</p>
<p>think this would be uh uh bigger. There&#x27;s 21,000 subscribers at the number 20 position. With our assumptions, this works out to $88,000 a year. Um and then if we look at finance, the number 20 was $16,000. And with our assumptions of $7 a month, that works out to about $67,000 a year. We got to be a little bit careful with business and finance because from what I understand with those categories, it&#x27;s not about having massive subscriber bases. It&#x27;s about having uh high-end subscriber bases that will pay a lot for your insights. Like if you&#x27;re a finance newsletter, you don&#x27;t need 500,000 subscribers, right?</p>
<p>What you need is a thousand people that are going to pay $500 a year because it&#x27;s really valuable information for them. So almost certainly those number 20 ranked newsletters in business and finance are making a lot more than that. But we&#x27;ll just stick with our assumptions for all categories to try to keep things fair. All right. So if we&#x27;re going to answer this question of how many people are making a living, if we use something like $150,000 a year is like a cut off of like oh a really good living you&#x27;re making off of Substack. We see that in uh politics, culture, and technology,</p>
<p>the top 20 newsletters are well above that. Um, and then if we get to business and finance, the top 20 are a little bit below it, but they&#x27;re actually probably there because they&#x27;re charging a little bit more. If we count up the total number of categories that were being conservative, the number we came up with is you&#x27;re going to end up with somewhere uh 500 plus, somewhere between 500 to,000. Let&#x27;s just say 500 to be conservative. You probably have like 500 plus people at this moment making a really good living like $150,000 a year</p>
<p>or more off of their Substack that they publish uh gross revenue. All right, so now we have numbers. I want to move on to try to figure out what does this mean in terms of Substack&#x27;s attempt to replace the failing print media. So question number four I want to ask Can this newsletter market grow to a comparable scale the print newspapers? Let&#x27;s look at some numbers about the print market and say, can this are we</p>
<p>going to get close to being comparable or will this always be much smaller than whatever newspapers actually were. Um, it&#x27;s kind of hard to find numbers, but we we looked into it and we we&#x27;ve we found various stats and statistics about the newspaper industry. Um, I&#x27;m going to point out a couple here and then we&#x27;re going to put them into a chart and compare them to what we know about Substack. All right, so this there&#x27;s this great 2023 fact sheet from Pew, the newspaper fact sheet. I have this on the screen for people who were watching. Uh, it has a lot of numbers, but there&#x27;s a couple I want to focus on. Here is the total</p>
<p>estimated circulation of US daily newspapers. You can see that this kind of plateaus and peaks in this 1980 1990s and it&#x27;s around uh 60 uh 60 million is its estimated that&#x27;s weekday circulation and then it falls. So if we look back at this it falls off a cliff and by the time we get to 2022 it&#x27;s they estimate it&#x27;s down to about 20 million. So at its peak he had 60 million daily newspapers. That was the circulation like printed. Um and it&#x27;s down to like 20 million. So we can</p>
<p>think of like there are 60 million subscribers to newspapers in uh its peak and now we&#x27;re down to about 20 million. All right. How much money were they generating? There&#x27;s another table in here. Um estimated revenue. We got to scroll down a few and then we&#x27;ll find in economics estimated advertising and circulation revenue of the of the newspaper industry. So, you know, they make money off subscriptions and advertisements. We add those two things. Um, we&#x27;ll look at advertising primarily because the circulation money is small. Advertising is where the money</p>
<p>is. Again, we see a peak interestingly came later. It&#x27;s over here uh right around like 2005 2006. You peak around $50 billion of the total newspaper industry was how much they were making off of their advertising. Uh this really drops as we get down to these estimates for 2020 uh 2022. This gets down to like nine around 9 or 10 9 10 to 11 billion depending on how you look at it. All right. So newspapers were pulling in as much as $50 billion and they have it&#x27;s sort of declined now quite precipitously</p>
<p>and it&#x27;s more like 9 to 11 billion um in the sort of post-pandemic era. There&#x27;s one other number. I don&#x27;t have it to show you, but I just we found it from another source. How many people were working in this industry? Well, we got to narrow it down because that includes like the people who the janitors and the buildings and the people who run the printers and the trucks. But if we if we narrow it down to how many editors and reporters were employed by the newspaper industry, we found a source that said the peak happened in 1990. There&#x27;s around 56,000 reporters and editors. By 2011, that had fallen to around 41,600.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to guess today that&#x27;s probably more in the like 20 to 30,000 range is how many like reporters and editors are are employed by newspaper print media. Now, what I&#x27;m going to do is I&#x27;m going to jump back to our tables and let&#x27;s put that let&#x27;s put these numbers all into our table here to try to make some sense of them. All right. So just as a reminder uh we are going to look at newspapers and we&#x27;ll look at both their peak and the more recent numbers because we have to see how they fell. Right? So if we look at circulation,</p>
<p>we had 60 million subscribers at newspapers peak down to something more like 20 million today. If we look at revenue, they&#x27;ve gone from like 50 billion at their peak in 2005 to now if we&#x27;re being generous somewhere around 11 billion a year. sort of where the industry is now in terms of writers and editors employed. It&#x27;s gone from 56,000 at their peak and we estimate now it&#x27;s probably around 25,000 people are employed. All right, let&#x27;s now compare that to the numbers we uh found about uh we want to compare that to the numbers</p>
<p>we can find about newsletters. Are they anywhere near that now? Is there a reasonable scenario where newsletters could get uh to comparable numbers? Well, let&#x27;s remember what we already established. We already established that there&#x27;s somewhere between uh 500 and uh 500 and a,000 to a,000 writers making a full-time living on Substack. I&#x27;m just looking at my numbers here. We found another source that said that Substack brought in $450 million in revenue in 2025. total 10% of that went, you know,</p>
<p>um, uh, do I have that backwards? I think that&#x27;s right. I think that&#x27;s what we found. $450 million &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; in revenue. Um, and that it had 5 million paid subscribers. So, let&#x27;s add those numbers to our table. So, like what we&#x27;ve added now is our equivalent of circulation for newsletters is the 5 million paid subscribers. So, I&#x27;m not counting free newsletter subscribers. If if you&#x27;re not paying, I&#x27;m not counting you as equivalent to someone who was paying for a newspaper. We have 5 million paid subscribers. That&#x27;s the</p>
<p>circulation. Revenue is around $450 million. And uh the journalist are I&#x27;m going to say 500, right? Because we calculated there was like 500 to a,000 people making a living, a good living. And so I think that&#x27;s the apples to apples comparison to, you know, journalists and editors in newspapers. All right. And so if we load back up this table, we&#x27;ll say, okay, these are um much different, right? So, so right now the newsletter economy is much smaller than the newspaper economy. You know, 5</p>
<p>million circulation versus even right now newspapers are at 20 million, $450 million in newsletters versus right now newspapers at 11 billion. Most notably, 500 kind of professional or full-time writers compared to something more like 25,000 right now. All right, let&#x27;s take a quick break to hear from one of our sponsors.

This is all kind of new. Uh so what we need is a good estimate of where we think the industry is going to go in terms of these numbers. And to get a optimistic estimate that we&#x27;re not just making up,</p>
<p>we found this article here. This is an an interview. This comes from a New Zealand newspaper because I guess uh Hamish McKenzie, the co-founder of Substack is from New Zealand. So they did a article about him. This is from two months ago. This is from November. And they&#x27;re just they&#x27;re they&#x27;re talking about him and he&#x27;s giving a lot of information and thoughts about how Substack is doing. But here&#x27;s the key thing I want to pull out. They they sort of ask him at the end, how big can this grow? What&#x27;s your goal here? And and here&#x27;s his line. I don&#x27;t see anything in the laws of physics that should prevent</p>
<p>Substack from getting to more than 50 million paid subscribers. So, they&#x27;re at 5 million now. He thinks the internet and the the environment based on their data, their goals are we should be able to 10x that. We should be able to if we grow this, right, to have about 50 million people who are paid subscribers on Substack. So, let&#x27;s use that as our index for the best case future for Substack. And here&#x27;s what we get. We now say, okay, what is their circulation? Well, they have 5 million paid subscribers now, but that would go up to 50 million in this scenario. Revenue, they have 450 million now. If we just</p>
<p>10x that, that goes up to 4.5 billion and 500 people making a living. Again, we&#x27;ll straight up 10x that to something more like 5,000. Now, this is getting interesting because what we are seeing is newsletters now or in this sort of best case scenario of where they&#x27;re hoping they&#x27;ll go don&#x27;t compare um in don&#x27;t really compare to new to newspapers at their peak. The the exception here will be in circulation</p>
<p>because newspapers had a circulation of 60 million at their peak versus 50 million page substract substract uh substack subscribers in this future scenario. When we look at revenue, newspapers were bringing in 50 billion versus more like five billion in the optimistic scenario for Substack. And they had, you know, 56,000 people working um as compared to 5,000 in Substack. But if we compare uh that future scenario for Substack to where newspapers are kind of right now, it&#x27;s comparable. So we could kind of imagine a a split like Substack has many more paid subscribers than there&#x27;s</p>
<p>current newspaper circulators. It&#x27;s bringing in comparable revenue to what newspapers are. Um, it&#x27;s an order of magnitude off in terms of number of people working full-time, but it&#x27;s in the realm of what we have right now full-time in newspapers. And if we look at these numbers with an even more optimistic hat on, we can actually inflate. There&#x27;s a case to inflate some of these. So, let&#x27;s put this back up on the screen here for a second, Jesse. Um, we can inflate this revenue number. Uh, so yeah, right now they&#x27;re making 450 million. So if you 10x the subscribers, you can imagine 4.5</p>
<p>billion. There are other ways to make revenue once you have a successful substack, which you know, newspapers, that&#x27;s going into their revenue numbers. We could also factor that in here. Like for example, you have to factor in something like uh paid ads, right? So you could you could have ads on your free version of your newsletters. Um this is something I did some numbers. Let&#x27;s see if I can find these. I I have some numbers on this from our own ad agency. So, right now, for example, you can get a uh if you have it&#x27;s possible to get a $35 CPM on just a display ad</p>
<p>that you put on your newsletter. So, that means you get $35 uh for every,000 people that read your newsletter. So, you could use this to convert unpaid subscribers into a revenue source. Uh so if you have for even numbers here a 100,000 subscribers and you have a 50% open rate. So you have uh each email generates 50,000 people read them. So you use that 50,000 reading that&#x27;s what the CPM is calculated on. That works out to be uh about $1,750</p>
<p>a newsletter. So, for each newsletter you send out, that ad, if 50,000 people actually read it, will generate 15 about $1,700. If you&#x27;re publishing like Nate Silver recommends, three newsletters a week that are getting those open rates, that&#x27;s quarter million dollars a year. So, there&#x27;s more revenue that&#x27;s latent here. There&#x27;s also events, there&#x27;s also speaking. Um, there&#x27;s also higher tier. So, you know, I think this is the right way to answer this question. Can Substack become comparable to print media or maybe we should say paid newsletters more generally? And the answer is like yeah it could be comparable to sort of where maybe not in</p>
<p>all ways the peak but sort of where that industry is now as it&#x27;s like twothirds of its way down as descent. So we can imagine the two charts of their successes newspapers come down paid newsletters can meet it relatively soon and maybe go a little bit and then go beyond that as those fall off. So there is a sense of a little bit of a replacement being possible. All right, question number five. Is Substack Media uh newsletter media more generally better or worse than the newspaper media that it&#x27;s replacing? So, let&#x27;s say it does do this. Are we better</p>
<p>or worse? I think we can make a couple arguments for each. There&#x27;s certain ways in which paid email newsletters are worse than newspapers. Newspapers have fact-checking, copy editing, and content editing. They also have large liability exposure. So, they&#x27;re very careful about, you know, traditionally what they print. Remember, like the Washington Post, you know, uh, was quick to print something that would have been completely it was what was being echoed all over social media. We talked about this before on the show. This was the the the Coington kids at the mall and there was like a picture taken of one of the kids and a and a Native American.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re they&#x27;re looking at each other real closely. And social media was like, &quot;Yeah, like these kids are terrible and they&#x27;re just like being, you know, arbitrarily mean to to indigenous people.&quot; And the Washington Post was like, &quot;Great, we&#x27;ll publish that.&quot; They&#x27;re kind of feeling the vibe of social media. And the student, the kid&#x27;s family is like, &quot;That&#x27;s not what happened. And you defamed us and we&#x27;re going to sue you.&quot; And it was somewhere between 20 or $50 million, some huge like victory they had on that because there&#x27;s huge liability exposure. But because of that as a reader of print newspapers is different than looking at social media or really looking at a</p>
<p>newsletter where the exposure is smaller you realize like they have to be kind of careful right like if they&#x27;re saying something it&#x27;s been fact checked it&#x27;s been copy edited there might be biases in how they say it but there also have large liability exposure so we can sort of there&#x27;s a trust there that you when you take get rid of that infrastructure you lose that all right newspapers can also send experts to locations to report on the scene and have uh special expertise so you know there&#x27;s something going on you know in Venezuela The New York Times is going to have someone in Central America who&#x27;s been stationed there who can walk around and see what&#x27;s going on, right? So, you lose</p>
<p>like boots on the ground reporting when you move away from centralized journalism. Uh, in the age of this is not as true now, but in the age of advertising being the main revenue for newspapers, you had to appeal to as many people as possible. So, you didn&#x27;t have as many biases in newspapers. And so they were like a pretty good sort of consistent descriptor of reality because when you make a living by department store ads, you don&#x27;t want to alienate any possible audience if you&#x27;re a major city newspaper. Now this is different today in an age of payw walls where it&#x27;s better to uh delight and thrill your paid subscribers than it is to try to</p>
<p>reach the broadest possible audience. And so now we have a lot more uh I think biases and reporting. But at least in its classic form, newspapers could give a pretty consistent view of reality um to a nation. Um, and just because of their fixed format, they would expose you to ideas and information that you otherwise might not have sought out on your own. But because it&#x27;s right there on the same page as something you are reading, you would learn a lot of things. Here are the ways in which newsletters, however, could be better than newspapers. As mentioned, in an age of social media and payw walls, media has moved away from its neutral observer status. It&#x27;s more important that you delight your</p>
<p>paid subscribers, and that&#x27;s what really matters. Um, because of this though, that means that you have much more partisanship in newspapers. But they still talk about it as if they don&#x27;t, as if it&#x27;s still back in like the 1990s days of department store ads pay the bills where these really were trying to be down the line. Because of that mismatch, we now have plummeting trust in news media. We see this on both sides of the political spectrum. No one trusts the traditional media. So that&#x27;s kind of crumbling. Um, I think you&#x27;re actually better off from a biased perspective with an individual writer because what happens is when you&#x27;re engaging with a</p>
<p>writer like Paul Krugman as opposed to an institution like the New York Times. We are very used to as social beings of assessing and understanding individuals, their perspective, their social cultural context and where they&#x27;re coming from. We can place humans very easily into different categories and adjust what we&#x27;re hearing accordingly. So, like if you read Paul Krugman, um you know, he&#x27;s a cl he&#x27;s classically left and that&#x27;s going to be the angle he&#x27;s going to take on everything. But it&#x27;s really easy to understand that with him. You know that from him. He&#x27;s not tricking you and he&#x27;s not trying to be otherwise. And you just</p>
<p>filter it through it. If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s far on the right, you&#x27;re like, I&#x27;m probably not going to subscribe at all because that&#x27;ll annoy me. But if you&#x27;re like a centrist, you&#x27;re center left, center right, you&#x27;re like, yeah, I can just adjust for what I&#x27;m hearing from K. I&#x27;m not mad at him. That&#x27;s just who he is. And he has a lot of interesting information. He&#x27;s a good economist. has a Nobel Prize and I can kind of filter out like where you know he&#x27;s being off the rails and where there&#x27;s like really good insight. So actually um trust and comfort with news sources when you&#x27;re dealing with individuals with a known profile. We as humans actually can deal much better with that than large centralized news sources that are just</p>
<p>claiming this is just like a neutral observation of of of reality and you&#x27;re kind of noticing all the ways in which it&#x27;s not. The newsletter economy also has a really good star making system. If a newsletter is popular, if it has a lot of subscriptions, it probably has gone through a pretty competitive process of earning every one of those eyeballs, which means the writers are good at what they do. You don&#x27;t necessarily have that in newspapers. You have a lot more people working their way up the up the chain. And uh they might be okay. They might not, you know, hey, you&#x27;re here. You&#x27;re a fact checker and now you&#x27;re a cub reporter and now we&#x27;re putting you on this desk. Like you do fine. You have</p>
<p>a lot more just sort of like okay writers. But in a competitive, infinitely scalable marketplace like digital paid newsletters, the winners are going to be really good. So you&#x27;re actually going to get really good writing. Remember like Nate Silver was being paid millions and millions of dollars by the times and then again by ABC ESPN because of like the skill he has and whatever uh his audience being excited about what he&#x27;s doing. Um, you also have a resistance to corporate advertisers or political pressure on these individual newsletters in a way that if you&#x27;re a really large</p>
<p>centralized corporation, you might not be able to free yourself from. So, the answer to this question is I think it depends. Newsletters are different than newspapers, but it&#x27;s not necessarily worse than like the current age of print newspapers now. So, I have some optimism there. All right, final question. How might this vision most go ary? Right? We&#x27;re being pretty optimistic here, but we should consider the the possibility that email newsletters sputter and fail to deliver anything like this traditional media replacement that we are discussing. I found an article that I think presents some good critiques. This from John Gruber&#x27;s Daring Fireball</p>
<p>newsletter and blog. He wrote this back in 2024 and it was called regarding and well against uh Substack. and he goes through some things that he is uh upset about. But among others, and I&#x27;m going to let me find the right thing to read here. Um here he is upset with people talking about Substack like it is a publication as opposed to a delivery mechanism. So, the quote he has at the top here</p>
<p>that&#x27;s upsetting him is, I&#x27;ll read it here. We constrain our imaginations when we subordinate our creations to names owned by fascist tycoons. Imagine the author of a book telling people to quote, &quot;Read my Amazon.&quot; End quote. A great director trying to promote their film by saying, &quot;Click on my Max.&quot; That&#x27;s how much they picked your brain when you refer to your own work and your own voice within the context of their walled garden. There is no such thing as my Substack. there is only your writing in a forever fight against a world of pure inshitification. And so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s upset about this move that Substack is making like no Substack is the thing</p>
<p>like Netflix or Twitter. It&#x27;s a platform that serves you information and writers are just serving Substack, but you as a consumer are consuming uh Substack, not the writings of Paul Krookman and the writings of Heather Richard Cox Richardson and the writings of Nate Silver. And there&#x27;s this sort of creeping fear that what Substack is going to try to do is say it&#x27;s not our goal to have 5,000 really good writers making a living with newsletters and offering</p>
<p>like a sort of competitive media ecosystem that can push back against the sort of initified digital attention tools. They might say that&#x27;s not our problem. Our problem is trying to become a hundred billion dollar valued company. And the way we get there is we got to have you know our 50 million users using this thing constantly. And so what we need to do is take and mix and remix content and everyone&#x27;s just providing us text and we&#x27;re going to create, you know, AI enabled customized newsletter snippets of stuff that&#x27;s popular and selected by algorithms pulled from everyone else and and that&#x27;s what we want is like we want to enter that world</p>
<p>of like a sort of stream of distraction just our stream happens to be textbased. There&#x27;s a real fear that that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to do. And that&#x27;s why you hear this terminology of like my Substack, I Substack, what&#x27;s going on on Substack in a way that, as Gruber points out, you would not hear about other neutral delivery platforms. I do not say, you know, like, &quot;Hey, Jesse, I don&#x27;t know if you um I don&#x27;t know if you read my WordPress, but like I I WordPress, and on my WordPress, I talk about, you know, whatever.&quot; No, like WordPress is the software on which I run my blog. I don&#x27;t call it my WordPress. I don&#x27;t say like, &quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve listened to my Simplecast.&quot; That&#x27;s the the hosting company that that</p>
<p>hosts our podcast like no have if you listen to my podcast. Right. So this is the biggest danger and it is probably for me a major my number one concern about this optimistic scenario is that I I have a hard time imagining Substack cares about trying to create an alternative to print media. They don&#x27;t want a thousand or 5,000 journalists to have a good living. They want 50 million users that use it constantly. They want to inshitify it into something like a a streambased Tik Tok, Twitter, Instagram style distraction machine because those</p>
<p>companies have huge valuations and that&#x27;s where they might push it. So what is our final answer here? I think I&#x27;m going to pull all these threads together. We have a chance at actually having the internet, the same internet that was destroying collective truth and reality and sort of serious journalism give us an alternative that&#x27;s not that bad. We did all the numbers. We see that&#x27;s possible. But if we hitch our wagon to this one company Substack, I worry about it. What we need is something like I mentioned</p>
<p>WordPress. That&#x27;s an open source project. We need like an open-source equivalence ways that you can have email newsletters that can be easily discovered, subscribed to, and take payments that is not tied to like a company that wants a huge valuation. You can do this all from scratch. Jesse and I, we do this from scratch. Our newsletter, we, you know, we we we pay for a hoster. We we do everything on our own, but it&#x27;s expensive and complicated. You know, we have someone that it&#x27;s like half of their job just to wrangle our newsletter software. And we don&#x27;t do</p>
<p>paid subscriptions, but if we did, that would be a whole other level of like complexity to try to do that um on our own. It cost a lot of money. I mean, I don&#x27;t know how much we It costs newsletters cost money. Like Substack&#x27;s eating a lot of money &gt;&gt; to host it. I I I don&#x27;t know exactly what ours is, but it&#x27;s at least $1,000 a month plus just to host and send emails to like that many people &gt;&gt; because you have a lot of emails. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we have like we send out whatever it is 125,000 emails, you know, each time we send out a newsletter and it&#x27;s expensive and people that&#x27;s friction that&#x27;s going to stop people from getting</p>
<p>there. We need a low enough friction alternatives either like indie substacks or open source substacks that make the friction low to start and take money and who aren&#x27;t interested in becoming a hundred million hundred billion dollar unicorn. If that ecosystem can emerge then I have faith in all this. If we if we hitch our wagon the Substack I just think their investors want the big return. And again having 5,000 Paul Krugman&#x27;s informing people making a good living. I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to do it. All right, so there we go. Um, I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>know if we fully answered our question, Jesse, but I think those numbers gave us a better look into what was going on. Um, can Substack save journalism? Uh, maybe something like paid newsletters might. There we go. Also, we should just be writing email all the time. I want to make $4 million a year &gt;&gt; with big banners. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that&#x27;s what I want to do. I mean, it helps that Paul Krugman has like 20 years of being a very famous columnist. How old is he? &gt;&gt; Um,</p>
<p>good question. I would guess 64. &gt;&gt; And he won the Nobel Prize 10 years ago. &gt;&gt; No, he would have won the Nobel Prize in like 200 early 2000s. &gt;&gt; Oh, that long ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, he&#x27;s a professor or was a professor at Princeton economist young. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, he started writing for the Times when he in 2000 because he was like a consistent voice against Judith Miller&#x27;s push for invading Iraq and then I think he won the Nobel after that like</p>
<p>in 2005 or 2008 or something like that. But that was probably for work he did before he joined the Times. But there you go. I like when writers are making money for writing words. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s all it is is words. Like he&#x27;s just his words and his mind. I mean that&#x27;s a hard seven days a week. But I think Silver is right. That&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a normal job. Yeah. &gt;&gt; 40hour a week job done with flexibility and then you&#x27;re making all that much money. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re also like really cognizant with your newsletter about not spamming your audience and making sure they get high quality content and &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like you&#x27;re really good about that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I&#x27;ve been doing it forever. I mean</p>
<p>I I think of my newsletter as like dispatches from the front lines of this battle of like depth against distraction. So it&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey, let me explain what&#x27;s going on. Here&#x27;s this new technology you should know about. Here&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s like done a really good job of finding depth in a way that&#x27;s inspiring. Here&#x27;s like a new idea about like how this economy works, the digital economy works. So, it&#x27;s like people who care about that tension between depth and distraction. I just want to be sending them useful dispatches. Uh I like doing I&#x27;ve been doing it forever. All right. Now, we&#x27;re going to move on to a new segment. If that was our idea segment, we&#x27;re now going to tackle uh practices. So, this is a segment where</p>
<p>we try to actually look at specific practices, whether they&#x27;re good or bad. we&#x27;ll assess them that might help you in your personal battle for depth in increasingly distracted world.</p>
<h2>How to successfully delete social media</h2>
<p>What we&#x27;re going to do here is we&#x27;re going to actually uh we&#x27;re going to load something from YouTube. And here&#x27;s the here&#x27;s the background, right? I did an interview with Andrew Huberman, I guess two years ago, year and a half ago, whenever my uh my book Slow Productivity came out, and that was a popular interview and and he cut he cut up a bunch of clips. One of the clips from that interview was uh called something like how to what&#x27;s the exact wording Jesse? Like &gt;&gt; how to successfully delete social media. &gt;&gt; How to successfully delete social media.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a five-minute clip from the interview. It went viral. So something about the particular advice I gave in that clip hit a chord in a way that you know I&#x27;ve done a lot of stuff about phones. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff online about phones and how to spend less time. But whatever I said in this clip seemed to to touch accord because I think it&#x27;s been viewed more than a million times now um since he&#x27;s he&#x27;s released it. So here&#x27;s what I want to do because I know it&#x27;s the new year and a lot of people are thinking about resolutions and one of the big resolutions a lot of people are thinking about these days is I want to use my phone less. There&#x27;s no shortage of advice. This clip, whatever I said in this clip, and I&#x27;m going to be</p>
<p>honest, I haven&#x27;t relisted to it in a long time. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it. This clip seemed to be hitting a nerve. So, we&#x27;re going to go through this clip bit by bit and I&#x27;m going to comment on and elaborate on the things I said and we&#x27;re going to try to extract from it the most useful big ideas for anyone who&#x27;s thinking about less phone use as a New Year&#x27;s resolution. All right. So, we&#x27;re going to do this like an audio style, right? &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we&#x27;ll just start it and then Jesse, I&#x27;ll tell you when to pause it and I&#x27;ll jump in. Recently, my podcast team was in Australia and um my producer and uh close friend here uh Rob Moore uh instructed all of us to get rid</p>
<p>of social media on our phones except one guy who would post our weekly episodes announcements. Um and it was pretty brutal at first and then coming back to social media has actually turned out to be more challenging. &gt;&gt; Um you really experienced the friction coming back the other way and then &gt;&gt; just pause it there for a second. All right. So, uh, this clip starts now. This is coming back to me. Jesse, remember it&#x27;s a nice day. Nice part of LA. Um, Huberman there. Can you tell his like raspy masculine voice from mine? &gt;&gt; Jacked.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; God&#x27;s a big guy. He is a strong He&#x27;s a strong gentleman. He&#x27;s in good shape. Um, between us, Huberman and I can combine bench press like 300 lb between the two of us. Uh, so there&#x27;s a good point he&#x27;s making there, right? He&#x27;s saying, &quot;Hey, let me give you a testimony.&quot; We went for an extended period without social media. And yes, it was hard to make the transition. But what was even harder was when we came back and I started using social media again because I had gotten what he&#x27;s saying here essentially is he had gotten used to life without it. And when he</p>
<p>added it back, it immediately created a lot of sort of um bad feelings. And so you don&#x27;t know how much negativity being on your phone all your time is injected into your life until you actually spend time away from it. We just kind of get used to what it feels like to constantly be looking at that slop and distraction on this little piece of screen. And it&#x27;s not until you get away from it that you realize like, wow, it&#x27;s like going from black and white to technicolor when I take that out of my life. All right, let&#x27;s keep going here. Jesse, what comes &gt;&gt; One experience is the the lack of friction. And that&#x27;s where it gets scary. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s so interesting the way that the brain can adapt. um the</p>
<p>friction leaving something behind um the friction coming back to it. Um and I think for people listening to this I I raised this because I think of course many people listening are you know have work that they really need to focus on. They may be having issues with uh productivity and burnout etc. I think a lot of people use the phone and social media because it fills their life. You know, it provides some enrichment and they aren&#x27;t necessarily committed to specific projects. But I guess through the lens of the the let&#x27;s just call it the Cal Newportian lens, one might argue that those people almost certainly have</p>
<p>untapped creativity, untapped. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let&#x27;s pause it there. Okay, so here&#x27;s the second big point that&#x27;s coming out of this clip. So Huberman started by setting up the idea that you don&#x27;t realize how much drag there is on your life from your phone until you get away from it. Then he gets the second point which now I&#x27;m remembering this conversation. I think this is the point that is beginning to separate this discussion from so much other advice about your phone that you&#x27;re going to find online. He immediately points out there&#x27;s a psychological dimension to this phone overuse beyond just like you have a bad habit. It is, and I&#x27;m paraphrasing to</p>
<p>him, for a lot of people, it&#x27;s filling a void that they otherwise have in their life. So, right off the bat, he&#x27;s acknowledging why we&#x27;re using our phone so much. And his answer is not weakness, dumbness, um, or not caring. He&#x27;s like, this is actually solving a problem for a lot of people. All right, let&#x27;s keep going. ing resources within them that um they don&#x27;t yet know about because they&#x27;re essentially using that energy elsewhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I think for a lot of people it&#x27;s papering over the void,</p>
<p>right? You have this void in your life because there&#x27;s unmet potential, uh unmet interest, um living in misalignment with the things you care about, right? I mean, a lot of people this is the classic sort of catastrophe of life, right? &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s pause it for a second there. Uh, a quick aside, I don&#x27;t have the video up on the screen, but Jesse will attest cuz he&#x27;s seeing it right now. Um, as we were talking, I was arm wrestling at Huberman and just destroying him just like boom. And then Huberman uh does like a little like bow thing to me and then he like points to his bicep and points to me and</p>
<p>gives a thumbs up and um yeah, so that&#x27;s going on. You just don&#x27;t see that. But I was I was physically dominating him. Um, okay. So I then pick up that thread, right? I I&#x27;m picking up the thread there and said like yes this is what I&#x27;ve seen there&#x27;s a lot of papering over the void that void is very well very real because of the catastrophe of living life there&#x27;s a lot of hardship things that go wrong things you have to deal with things that aren&#x27;t unfolding the way you want and that creates a void and I said papering over the void but you can also think about like the brightness of your phone screen hits</p>
<p>your eyes in such a way that you lose your night vision you don&#x27;t see it be beyond you it sort of hides it from you know it&#x27;s there but you don&#x27;t actually have to see it. All right, let&#x27;s hear some more. Social media and there&#x27;s before this it was other things, right? There&#x27;s other intoxicants or other sorts of distractions. It&#x27;s a way for some people of essentially putting a screen over that like gaping void and it like just makes it bearable enough that you can kind of go on with life. And so it is true if you just rip it out you see the void and that&#x27;s really difficult right I mean because I I did this experiment for one of my</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; let&#x27;s pause here before we get to the experiment. All right. So, uh, again, what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes here, and Jesse will attest to this, is actually during that clip when I was talking, Huberman leaves the camera, comes back in a full Brazilian jiu-jitsu ghee with his black belt on, points to me, I get a quick submission on him, he gets up, takes off his black belt, hands it to me. All right, but anyways, let&#x27;s get back to the actual words that are happening here. U, there&#x27;s a lot of, now I&#x27;m really unpacking why this went, what about this was resonating. Again, there&#x27;s a lot of uh if we don&#x27;t</p>
<p>recognize the psychological realities in which phone use happens, it really becomes a very sort of sterile conversation. And one of the points I made in there, which I want to make again right now, is that we&#x27;ve seen similar sort of addictions rise in other past difficult times, they were just different substances. It was like during the hard, if you were in the like the 19th century, early 20th century living in one of the you newly industrialized urban environment, you were all at taverns all the time. you&#x27;re drinking all the time because life was really hard, right? You were living, you had very little control and autonomy and you were barely making enough money to to to</p>
<p>support yourself and and you&#x27;re all crammed into like a tenement or whatever. And this was like the environment where it got so bad that like we had the prohibition movement, right? So, we it&#x27;s not the first time we&#x27;ve seen this, but in hard times, we look for ways to avoid it. And the phones have been offering us a way to do it. All right. I teased at the end of that last segment there that I had run an experiment that gave us some more insight into that. So, let&#x27;s hear about that. I ran an experiment with 1600 people and they all turned off all their social media for 30 days. &gt;&gt; 30 days.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; 30 days, right? &gt;&gt; These are young people, old people. &gt;&gt; A whole mix. Okay. &gt;&gt; A whole mix, right? &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not just university students. &gt;&gt; I recruited them from my my newsletter readership. So, they weren&#x27;t university students. And it wasn&#x27;t formal research. It was, you know, I put out the call, right? So, this is not randomly sampled, right? But I put out the call and I said, &quot;Here, I&#x27;m going to walk you walk you through this.&quot; Um, and I got a lot of information back. So, people reported back how it went. And this was like the number one thing I heard was it&#x27;s really hard at first, right? And so, who were the people that succeeded for 30 days versus those who didn&#x27;t? The the ones who didn&#x27;t succeeded tended to just try to white knuckle it. Just be like, I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t like how much I&#x27;m using social media. I&#x27;m just going to stop because it&#x27;s bad and I don&#x27;t want to do a bad thing. I&#x27;m just going to like, you know, hold on the table with white knuckles. They wouldn&#x27;t make it 30 days. the people who did succeed followed my advice to incredibly aggressively pursue alternatives in those 30 days. So, it&#x27;s like go learn new hobbies, join things right away. Get like really All right. So, again, we really haven&#x27;t yet said anything about how to change what&#x27;s on your phone, how to change your settings, what to do with your notifications, whether or not you should put your phone in the grayscale, if you should have</p>
<p>some sort of brick device, make your phone harder to use, what type of rules you should have about your phone. We&#x27;re almost done with the clip. like how much time is left? &gt;&gt; Few minutes. &gt;&gt; Two minutes left, right? So, we&#x27;re more than halfway through the clip. We haven&#x27;t talked anything about strategies for putting your phone away. What are we talking about here? I said, look, when I studied 30 uh 1,500 people who spent 30 days without using their phone, the people who succeeded were the people who aggressively were exploring through reflection, experimentation what they actually enjoyed. They were finding new activities. They were going out and</p>
<p>trying new things. They were trying to uh fill in their life in interesting ways. They had a much easier time not having their phone. The other people just white knuckled and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to use this just like I don&#x27;t want to smoke and I&#x27;m just going to sit here staring at being like, you&#x27;re not going to get me today.&quot; Eventually, their willpower buckled and they ended up using it again more often than not. This goes back to the void explanation that we gave before by aggressively trying to fill in things in their life that were meaningful. What they were doing is filling in the void. And when you fill in that void through</p>
<p>actual activity, through actual connection, through actual self-reflection and growth, you don&#x27;t need to hide yourself from it anymore. The importance of saying I need to keep my eyes from focusing on or I have to paper over so I don&#x27;t see it. That goes away when the void is much smaller. And that&#x27;s the kind that&#x27;s the point I want to pull out of it. So I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll stop playing the clip from here because I think that gets to the key point. We just riff on that for a little bit while longer if I remember correctly. But the best advice about using your phone less, as we see here in this viral clip, really has nothing to do with your phone or your habits around your phone or how you use your phone. It&#x27;s about</p>
<p>everything else in your life. And it&#x27;s an important practice to think about right now in this sort of new year part uh of the calendar. The more you have things that are meaningful, the more that you are making sense of your life of the challenges and the positive things and building them into a narrative, a heroic narrative that&#x27;s meaningful and values based, the more that you&#x27;re connecting with other people, the more that you&#x27;re sacrificing non-trivial time and intention on behalf of other people. The more that you&#x27;re putting yourself in the situations for appreciation or awe, the more you&#x27;re out there doing hard</p>
<p>things and you can see the reward your intentions made manifest concretely in the world, the more, in other words, you activate your deeply human brain to all the possibilities of human life, the more stupid that little rectangle is going to seem and the easier it&#x27;s going to seem to say, why would I look at like an AI generated short form video on a small rectangle when I got a life to And so I think this is like a numerical experiment. There are a lot of clips about using your phone less that aren&#x27;t doing as well as this one.</p>
<p>And the difference is this one says very little about your phone. In fact, there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s an AB comparison you can find on Huberman&#x27;s channel himself. Uh 6 months ago, he he also posted a very similar titled clip uh with Annie Lympkkey who wrote Dopamine Nation. It&#x27;s also like how to use your phone less or whatever. And it&#x27;s very good science. Andy&#x27;s great scientist on this, but it really gets into like here&#x27;s why you&#x27;re addicted and here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on in your brain and here&#x27;s like things you might do to reduce it. You might spend less time with your phone. You might do take breaks on a regular basis, like just like addiction science type of stuff. And that clip, you know, same</p>
<p>feed, same title is like a 20th of the views because I think we&#x27;re hitting on something real. It&#x27;s like an experiment. We get to the psychology in which phone use happens. And so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to leave you with in our practice segment today. If you&#x27;re worried about your phone, start worrying about making the rest of your life better. Then return to the phone in your habits. Don&#x27;t white knuckle it. Don&#x27;t say, &quot;This is bad. I just want to do something less bad.&quot; Make your life good. And the the shallower alternative is not going to be as appealing. Um, I think in the final two</p>
<p>minutes, you&#x27;ve seen the clip. I think in the final two minutes of the clip, uh, me and Human get into a fullout fist fight. Duck the punch, block the other, come in, pick him up, drop him. He stands up barely like clutching it and he applauds and points to him and then he hands me a trophy off of his wall cuz you are the king now. We&#x27;re gonna he&#x27;s going to just come beat me up at some point. Anyways, there we go. So anyways, I think that was useful. A little bit of practical advice to help you in your own quest to fight for death in a distracted world. All right. Well,</p>
<p>we still want to hear from you. So, we got a a couple questions that you have sent in that we will hear from now.</p>
<h2>Is it ok to use ChatGPT to try to better understand some classics?</h2>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. First question is from Victoria. I&#x27;m reading through some classics. I keep my phone close to use chat GPT to enhance my understanding. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; I mean, it&#x27;s not terrible. The the good news is you&#x27;re reading classics and I think trying to have a secondary information to help you make it through a harder book is great. And if you want to have ChatGpt give you like a summary of the chapter you&#x27;re about to read, that&#x27;s fine. Or themes or why is this important? Like that&#x27;s fine. I think it&#x27;s better if you follow the links from ChatGpt and maybe actually read some of the articles it&#x27;s pulling from because it kind of tends to make things up or it</p>
<p>mixes and matches or it kind of figures out what you want to hear. So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s better to get to the the primary secondary source, which was a complicated way of saying it, but the primary source that chat GPT is using that source itself being a secondary source about the classic book that you&#x27;re reading. The key thing is not to interrupt mid-reading, right? It takes a while for your brain to fire up all the networks needed to make sense of written words and turn it into sort of an internal cognitive understanding. So, you don&#x27;t want to be interrupting every few pages to go look something up. You want to ceue up understanding by reading an article or a chatd summary, then do an entire chapter or more in a row um</p>
<p>before you then interrupt your focus again. But I am all about bringing in other sources, whatever makes that book more approachable and interesting to you. to me the better. All right, who do we got next?</p>
<h2>How do I decide what to write down when I use the notebook method?</h2>
<p>&gt;&gt; Next up is Jason. I often feel like whatever I&#x27;m writing down in my notebooks isn&#x27;t quite right or good enough. How do you decide what&#x27;s worth writing down? &gt;&gt; So Jason probably heard a recent episode from over the break that was on using single-purpose notebooks where I recommend having a notebook when you&#x27;re working on a particular challenge or idea that you have a dedicated small notebook where you can capture all your thoughts. So Jason, here&#x27;s the key thing about these notebooks. the the value happens after you filter. Like the notebooks collect novel brain reconfigurations in</p>
<p>a way that you&#x27;re not going to forget them. Most aren&#x27;t good. The magic then happens when whatever you&#x27;re going to do with these, you read over all these. The good ones you then pull out. So, it&#x27;s writing down whatever comes to your mind relevant to a topic in the notebook. That&#x27;s step one of two of getting to really good ideas. Like what I&#x27;ll often notice in my idea notebooks is I&#x27;ll look for um you know most of the things like when I go back they&#x27;re like it&#x27;s not so great. I&#x27;ll look for things that either stand out or more frequently what happens is I come back to them again and again. So you know in my my lifestyle ccentric</p>
<p>planning notebooks where I&#x27;m just capturing notes about things that resonate and don&#x27;t. Yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of nonsense in there. just like in the moment. I think it&#x27;s exciting. Like I I had an example in the book I&#x27;m writing on the deep life where where I talk about exactly this by the way like writing down insights about your life in a notebook. I talk about how like most of them aren&#x27;t going to be uh in retrospect that that useful. And I had an example. I&#x27;m trying to remember it. I think it was like you could imagine you were going to your first like NASCAR race or Indie car race and maybe in the moment it&#x27;s like super exciting and it&#x27;s like visually very novel and there&#x27;s 100,000 people in these cars and you&#x27;re</p>
<p>like, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m having a reaction here. I&#x27;m going to write something down.&quot; like this is really interesting. I&#x27;m having strong reactions. This is really cool. Later, you might look back at that and be like, you know, there&#x27;s I was just reacting to like the novelty of the moment, but there&#x27;s not really a deep insight here that&#x27;s relevant to my life. So, there&#x27;s a lot of in stuff you write down would be that important. I tend to find if it&#x27;s like lifestyle observations, what I&#x27;m looking for is, oh, I&#x27;ve written this down like five different times in the last six months. Like, I keep finding other examples of this thing and writing it down. This is sticking around. That means something to me. or I&#x27;ll just be going back through and it&#x27;ll just stand out to me like, &quot;Oh, that is still seems</p>
<p>really good.&quot; Whereas other things in retrospect don&#x27;t seem really good. And so it&#x27;s in the filtering of what you write down that ultimately get the value. So don&#x27;t worry, get it down. Get out of your head so you&#x27;re not stressed about it. Get out of your head so it&#x27;s on paper. You&#x27;ll see it. You don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s going to influence in the future. That idea might be terrible, but it might set up some other ideas that are good down the line. So don&#x27;t fret. Your notebook is not precious. Not no one&#x27;s going to publish it. No one&#x27;s going to pour over it. It doesn&#x27;t have to be good handwriting. Doesn&#x27;t have to be beautifully written. And it doesn&#x27;t have to be brilliant ideas. Just get the stuff down. That&#x27;s the nice thing.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re cheap paper. It&#x27;s yours. Personal. Just right. All right. Let&#x27;s take another quick break to hear from our sponsors. Let me tell you about a product I&#x27;ve been actively using recently and really enjoying. Factor. If you&#x27;re not familiar, Factor is a meal delivery service that delivers fresh, never frozen, chef crafted, and dietitian approved meals straight to your doorstep, ready to eat in just two minutes. You just pop them in the microwave. They have over 100 rotating weekly options for meals that&#x27;s made from real food with real ingredients, no</p>
<p>refined sea oils, no refined uh sugars, no artificial colors, and the food tastes great. Now, here&#x27;s why I become a factor enthusiast. It allows me to automate healthy eating. I like to use fa factor uh for lunch because I don&#x27;t always have the energy to prepare something healthy from scratch and takeout is always lurking as an option right right there on the periphery. And with factor I can just automate all that. No, I&#x27;m just going to grab a factor meal right in the microwave. Couple minutes later I&#x27;m eating something that&#x27;s going to taste good and that I know is healthy. So if you want to make healthy e eating easier this year, consider using factor.

I also want to talk about our friends at Monarch. One of my big goals for the new year is to try to get our finances back under</p>

<h2>For professional writers trying to succeed today, isn’t Substack the platform of the moment?</h2>
<p>All right, next up is Dirk. With organic search getting worse or replaced by AI powered chat bots, social media broken, and mainstream media paying less and less, it&#x27;s hard to build an audience and make money writing without using a tool like Substack. The indie web is a beautiful idea, but it seems it only works for writers who built their audience long ago. For professional writers trying to succeed today, isn&#x27;t Substack the platform of the moment? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s look at this question through the filter of our idea segment. Um, there&#x27;s two ways of seeing it. You could say like, hey, for</p>
<p>writers, as the traditional media goes away, the only real option is something like paid email newsletters. And that seems really limited. It isn&#x27;t too bad that like all these other more indie web tools can&#x27;t support making a living like we hope they might one day do. But on the other hand, uh we never expected that there is more indie web stuff like blogs came along before and just personal websites like those didn&#x27;t monetize very well for various reasons, but we should expect them to. It&#x27;s actually like very hard to</p>
<p>find an economic niche where you can actually efficiently match money to talent in a way that&#x27;s a non-trivial market size. And when you find those niches, they tend to get really big and be very important, but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re way more narrow than you think. Like most types of media doesn&#x27;t work. And then the niches that work blow up. Printed newspaper, that works. Books work. Blogs didn&#x27;t work. Um, you know, pamphlets didn&#x27;t work. Nollas haven&#x27;t really worked. But, uh, paid newsletters do, right? So, certain things work, most things don&#x27;t. So, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really u necessarily</p>
<p>a problem. What I do think is a problem is if the medium is dominated by a single company. That&#x27;s our main I I mean, I got into this in the idea segment. That&#x27;s the main issue with Substack is not the model. I think a paid newsletter model. We went through the numbers. that could be a fair replacement for like newspapers in terms of size and market and diversity. What I worry about is one company offered it. That&#x27;s when we have problems. If it&#x27;s just Substack because they can initify this and just make it into some sort of like digital soilent green type of nonsense slop.</p>
<p>So what we need is not like the old indie web stuff to be successful. Like won&#x27;t people just pay for my micro blog or my you know WordPress? We need more indie web uh copies of Substack. We need more independent Substacks. We need more platforms run by more people where the friction is low for me to put out content and to make money from it. The other thing you really have to keep in mind when you think about these new type of paid media is in the history of media. When you get new media, it does open up different ways of reaching people. But when money&#x27;s involved, the truth remains it is very very hard</p>
<p>to make money doing something in media. that it has always been a very narrow peak of a very large mountain. And this is something that we often get wrong. When a new technology comes along that is opening up more access to an audience, we think that should mean it should greatly increase the number of people who can make a living or make a lot of money doing something. But it doesn&#x27;t, right? Like the internet meant anyone could publish text now and anyone could read it. That&#x27;s a major breakthrough. Before you had to actually have physical machines to put ink on paper and you had to distribute that paper by putting in the back of trucks and driving them places. Most people could not put text in a place where</p>
<p>other people could reach it. The internet meant everyone could. But did that mean we then had hundreds of millions of like people making a living like writers? No, because it still has to be good. And so whenever we get these new media forms, it doesn&#x27;t actually lead to a huge explosion in the number of people uh who can make a living to medium. It just changes the way they can do it or the parameters around what they do. And that&#x27;s something to keep in mind. The email newsletter economy might replace newspapers. It&#x27;s not going to mean a 100,000 people now can make Krugman money. It&#x27;s really hard to be Paul Krugman. But now Paul Krugman has an alternative to the New York Times to</p>
<p>reach people. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about here. So, um, don&#x27;t be disappointed when you&#x27;re like, I don&#x27;t know, man. Everyone I knew tried to start a newsletter and didn&#x27;t make any money off of it. Like, yeah, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s most media. Most television pilots never get picked up. And that&#x27;s like at the end of a very large pyramid of professional writers and performers and a lot of money was put into this and everyone to make it work. And most of those fail. So of course like your random thing you did is probably not going to succeed. That&#x27;s okay. Broadening access to information doesn&#x27;t go handinhand with broadening massively the number of people who can make a living off information. So we should keep that in mind as well. So my main</p>
<p>concern is not having just new media form replacing old one. I think that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s having only one player in town. we need more indie or open source or smaller more niche uh alternatives to Substack which I think we&#x27;re going to get Jesse because they&#x27;re if they in shitify you know like oh it&#x27;s all streams and we just want to show you all sorts of stuff and get you like to look at your app more and more there&#x27;s a market for someone else to be like okay we&#x27;ll just do like old substack it&#x27;s not that hard of a technological problem I think there&#x27;s a lot of writers like yeah I&#x27;ll just take my email list and I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>move it over this new platform that has a better interface my subscribers don&#x27;t care because they&#x27;re getting they can get through email, they don&#x27;t have to get through the app. &gt;&gt; Uh so that&#x27;s my my my hopeful prediction is that if Substack moves towards the sort of slop attention distraction mode, then the good writers will just shift the new alternatives that&#x27;ll that&#x27;ll pop up. &gt;&gt; Can you define and shitify? You use that a few times. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we did a podcast episode on this a while ago. This is Cory Doctro&#x27;s notion of what happens is with a lot of these attention economy digital tools is that they do things that makes them useful that grows an audience and</p>
<p>then they shift their focus to trying to make as much money as possible off that audience and it makes the tool much worse. Then the tool gets kind of terrible. This is like Facebook. It was very useful. Like, oh, everyone I know is on here and they can post updates about what they&#x27;re up to and I can see what people I know are up to. Like what&#x27;s their relationship status? Let me see pictures of their kids. But then to make the most money off of their users, Facebook have moved their model more and more away from that and towards like algorithmically curated crap full of ads that fills up your thing because it&#x27;s like more addictive for the people who use it. They&#x27;ll use</p>
<p>it more often. They have more ads to sell them. But it&#x27;s a way worse experience and people are are fleeing in drones. So Cory Do&#x27;s theory and he he he coined this term a long time ago, but he has a new book out about this. His theory is that like this is like an inevitable cycle when you have broadly funded digital attention economy tools. And so like Substack will probably uh fall prey to that, but maybe it won&#x27;t. So we&#x27;ll see. All right. Um finally, I</p>
<h2>Cal gives his weekly reading update</h2>
<p>want to end each episode talking quickly about what I&#x27;ve been reading. And well, we just came out of December, Jesse, and I read my five books in December, but more importantly, December is my time for reading thrillers. Uh so I thought I would briefly mention the three thrillers I read in December, and then I&#x27;m going to rank order them. All right. Number one I read was Airframe by Michael Kiteon. It was a lesserk known thriller of his, but he wrote it like at the height of his postJTurassic Park powers in the 1990s. No high concept plot. There is no dinosaurs or time travel or aliens. It is really just there&#x27;s an accident on an</p>
<p>airplane and they&#x27;re investigating it and trying to figure out what it is and the company has a big pending deal with the Chinese and they don&#x27;t want that to be jeopardized and they&#x27;re trying to cover up some of the issues and there&#x27;s some labor unrest. That&#x27;s it. But it&#x27;s like classic thriller where you get into the details of airplane safety and how it works and good pacing. Then I read another Kiteon book that I hadn&#x27;t read in a very long time, The Great Train Robbery. He wrote that way back in the 60s or 70s, like pretty early in his career where it was like an he took an</p>
<p>actual event, a Victorian England train robbery, did a lot of research on it and then kind of dramatized it in a novel. He kind of walks through the steps of it. It&#x27;s a sort of a Sting style. Uh, in fact, I&#x27;m interested in the connection between Sting, the Sting, and this. I think this came first. Very much like the con is coming together, but you don&#x27;t know all the how it&#x27;s all going to work in the end until it all kind of comes together. Um, and then I read Fantastic Voyage, your adventure book. It was a movie that was a short story that got made into a movie. I think</p>
<p>Raquel Welch was in it. And then Isaac Azimoff turned a movie into a novel. And the novel is what I read. It&#x27;s about people being shrunk down in a submarine and put inside someone&#x27;s body and it&#x27;s like their journey through like the human body. These were all three really good classic adventure novel thrillers. I think if I had to rank them, I&#x27;m going to put Airframe number one. It had the the the least high concept plot, but it was just perfectly executed. It is a really wellexecuted thriller. As someone at the height of his powers, you get really interested in the mechanics of airplane function, airplane safety.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a ticking clock element to it which keeps it moving and the plot just rolls. You&#x27;re from this to this to this. It takes place times over just like a small number of days and this whole thing kind of unfolds. You really care what&#x27;s going on even though like you don&#x27;t actually care about the subject matter at all. It shows how good Kiteon had become at riding techno thrillers and he didn&#x27;t need the high concept for it to to actually um roll forward. It&#x27;s also the beginning of his sort of like reactionary sort of crankiness. You start to see that in this book. He&#x27;s sort of like very anti- labor union. Like he was starting to become in the 90s is when he began to become a little</p>
<p>bit more reactionary, but that&#x27;s fun. Um, uh, Great Train Robbery was very well researched. It&#x27;s a little bit annoying because it was written in sort of like this Victorian English pros. I didn&#x27;t really care that much. Like I I you knew they robbed it and eventually got caught. So, it was more just about I&#x27;m interested to see how the robbery works, which is interesting. So, it&#x27;s a pretty good book. Fantastic Voyage is a very uh it&#x27;s a slight book. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a an old school sort of like small paperback of the type I wrote about in my newsletter a few weeks ago about the rise of like these paperback originals</p>
<p>that don&#x27;t really have an equivalent today. They&#x27;re kind of short and they&#x27;re entertaining and they&#x27;re meant to give you like six hours or four hours of entertainment. And this thing just moved. It was great. They&#x27;re like, &quot;Yeah, let&#x27;s just say we can shrink people. Don&#x27;t worry about it. We can just do it. We shrink them and what would happen?&quot; And it just like unfolds this adventure as this submarine moves through the body and the science is good and there&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a welltimed plot and there&#x27;s a a double agent type cross where someone on this submarine is a turncoat and there&#x27;s a giant ticking clock set up because they they only have an hour before they reexpand it kills the person they&#x27;re in. Um this is just a</p>
<p>well- constructed I know Azimoff had this club in his bag. A well- constructed adventure thriller with a big technical aspect in as well. really I I really enjoyed it and didn&#x27;t try to do too much. Like they got you to that room quick, it finished and then they left and that&#x27;s uh that was that was the entire book. So I thought that was uh that was also really good. So Thriller December Jesse was a success. I also read a book about the Simpsons and one other book. I think what else I read? Um</p>
<p>I forgot what the fifth book was. Anyways, I wrote I read five books in this number. The thrillers is what I want to check in on because that&#x27;s what people care about. All right, that&#x27;s all the time we have for today. Hey, let us know. You can send a note to Jesse calport.com if you like this move towards the two segments ideas and practices. Um, I&#x27;m going to try for a little while. Hope you like it. All right, we&#x27;ll be back next week with another episode. And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, now that we&#x27;re in the new year, you might have missed episode 384, which was about the books you should consider reading this month to have a deeper year ahead. Uh, check</p>
<p>it out if you missed it before. I think you&#x27;re going to like it. So, we&#x27;re going to do a deep dive on the question that I probably am asked the most by you, which is, &quot;What should I</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>A shorter work week experiment</h2>
<p>One of the biggest beliefs about our current high- techch, always on, very busy age is that the key to succeeding professionally is to work more. You want to get ahead, put in more hours. You want your company to overcome its competitors, increase the weekends you&#x27;re there, increase the evenings that you&#x27;re there. But is this actually true? Well, last spring in an episode of my podcast, I took a look at a collection of really interesting studies that were done in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic that looked at experiments with shortening</p>
<p>the work week, working less, and trying to see what the impact was on lots of different factors. There was a really astounding result that emerged from this research that I think completely changes the way we think about the relationship between busyness and actually producing things that matters. And so the clip you&#x27;re about to see is from that episode where I go in specifically and I walk through those studies and I point out that result and I try to uh give you a whole new way of thinking about what really matters for doing work that is going to make a difference. I think</p>
<p>you&#x27;re going to like this clip. Check it out. Over the past four years, a remarkable story has been quietly unfolding in the knowledge sector. A growing interest in the viability of a 4day work week. Iceland helped spark this movement with a series of government sponsored trials that unfolded between 2015 and 2019. The experiment eventually included more than 2500 workers, which believe it or not is actually about 1% of Iceland&#x27;s total working population. The UK followed</p>
<p>suit. They had a six-month trial that included over 60 companies and close to 3,000 total employees. This concluded in 2023. A year later, 45 firms in Germany participated in a similar half-year experiment with a reduced work week. And these are far from the only such experiments being conducted. According to a 2024 KPMG survey, close to a third of large US companies are at the very least considering the idea of experimenting with 4day work weeks, at least for some employees. All right. So, the reason I&#x27;m bringing these up is not</p>
<p>to directly assess whether a 4day work week [clears throat] is a good idea, though I will return to that to the at the end of the discussion here. but instead because as I&#x27;ll show these studies if you look deeper have a important data point in them that I think points to a really important conclusion an idea that is critical if we want to understand knowledge work in our current moment. It&#x27;s an idea that I call the workload fairy tale. All right,</p>
<h2>The workload fairytale</h2>
<p>so let&#x27;s get to this hidden point that shows up in every one of these studies. Um I&#x27;m going to switch over now to some of these studies. Let&#x27;s see. These are probably in what? The browser, Jesse? &gt;&gt; Yep. All right. Um, let&#x27;s start with a claim from the Iceland study. For those who are watching, uh, I have a summary of the Iceland study up here. Here&#x27;s a key claim from the beginning of this article. Productivity remained the same or improved in the majority of workplaces. So, of the 1% of population of Iceland participate in this, they did not see a</p>
<p>decrease in productivity. All right, let&#x27;s look at what happened in the UK. Here is a summary of the UK study. This is coming from the Guardian. This has a similar quote. Across a wide variety of sectors, well-being has improved dramatically for staff and business productivity has either been maintained or improved in nearly every case. And remember, these are experiments in which they are taking 5 to eight hours out of the work week, keeping the salary the same, making no other changes. The German</p>
<p>study, let me load up a summary here from a German newspaper. They report something similar. I&#x27;m reading now. Employees generally felt better with fewer hours and remained just as productive as they were with a 5day week and in some cases were even more productive. Participants reported significant improvements in mental and physical health and showed low stress and burnout symptoms as confirmed by data from smartwatches tracking daily stress minutes. step back. All right, let&#x27;s step back and uh consider this for a moment. These are outst uh astonishing</p>
<p>findings. How is it possible that with changing nothing else, just telling people you now have to work notably less hours per week that the overall value of what they are producing, their overall productivity didn&#x27;t go down? A big part of this answer, I&#x27;m convinced, is a an idea that&#x27;s pretty important from my book, Slow Productivity, and it&#x27;s the idea of the overlooked importance of workload</p>
<h2>Workload management</h2>
<p>management. Here&#x27;s the normal setup. Most knowledge workers have a surprising amount of autonomy over their workload, especially as compared to like a service worker or someone in an industrial context. Right? If I&#x27;m a service worker, here&#x27;s what you need to do. Clock in and do this. It&#x27;s very prescribed, right? If you&#x27;re the the barista at Starbucks, it&#x27;s very clear what the responsibilities are. If I work on an assembly line, it&#x27;s very clear like what I am doing. I don&#x27;t have a lot of say in what I want to or not work on. In knowledge work, this is different. You have freedom to say yes or no. There&#x27;s a sort of unstructured way that</p>
<p>commitments come to you. Know some stuff maybe you can&#x27;t say no to, but ultimately you are the source of triage of incoming potential commitments. There&#x27;s also no transparency or direct supervision of your workload. You grab the average knowledgework manager and take one of their charges and say, &quot;What are they working on right now?&quot; They don&#x27;t know. They can&#x27;t say, &quot;Here&#x27;s the six things that this person is working on.&quot; There&#x27;s no transparency in this. What you&#x27;re working on is up to you to keep track of. In fact, most workers themselves don&#x27;t even know at any one moment the full slate of their commitments. They sort of get prodded</p>
<p>into action with like email or Slack prompts or meeting invites. Oo, I need to start doing something on this. So there&#x27;s no direct supervision or transparency of workload as well. Now most knowledge workers in this I got to say like pretty unusual situation for the economic the world of economics this unusual situation of workload autonomy tell themselves what I call the workload fairy tale and the workload fairy tale claims that the amount of work that you&#x27;re doing right now is the exact right amount needed to be successful in your position that somehow it is all</p>
<p>just worked out that like whatever it is you&#x27;re doing this is what you need to be doing it&#x27;s the exact right amount, not more, but if you do less, it&#x27;s going to be a big problem. The results of these 4day work week studies undermine this claim. Productivity did not generally go down for these research subjects even after the amount of time they had to work was substantially reduced. And if we think about why this is, the answers are actually not that surprising. uh especially if you&#x27;ve read like Slow Productivity or listened to</p>
<p>the show before, the the key work in most jobs, the efforts that actually drive those pure economic productivity measures, you know, dollars produced per worker hours employed, the key work in most jobs requires much less than a 40-hour work week to complete. Just go back. If you do something like time block planning, go back and highlight with a highlighter every time block from the last week in which you were working on something that directly produced value for your organization. You&#x27;re not going to have full columns marked with highlighter. You&#x27;re going to</p>
<p>say, you know what, there was like 15 hours this week. Maybe there was 10 hours this week where I was actually directly doing the things that create value. This course is very different than the service sector, the industrial sector where outside of breaks and lunch like everything you&#x27;re doing is directly producing value. So everything else you&#x27;re doing is uh either more opt it&#x27;s more optional like you&#x27;re doing it for social reasons or it&#x27;s make work or it&#x27;s non-promotable activities or it&#x27;s just a embrace of pseudo productivity. I want to show some activities. I&#x27;m going to kind of bounce around emails and and make some unnecessary meetings. Now look, not all of this is bad, but</p>
<p>there&#x27;s no reason to fill, you know, every available minute of your day with</p>
<h2>Filling your time with optional work</h2>
<p>this optional work. The stuff that really matters doesn&#x27;t actually need that much time. This is what&#x27;s being revealed by these 4day work week studies. The workload fairy tale is in fact a fairy tale. You&#x27;re actually probably doing a lot more extra stuff than you really need to to do your job well. So, if we return to the original question here, hey, but what about this 4-day work week? Is it itself a good idea? I have nothing against it, but it seems to me that if we solve the underlying workload problem, if we get rid of the workload fairy tale and have</p>
<p>more control over, well, how much work should we be doing and what are the key factors and how much of the option work should I be doing on my plate? A lot of the issues with burnout that drive ideas like the 4-day work week are actually going to go away. a 4-day work week itself is not going to have a problem that it is solving. So once we recognize there&#x27;s only so much we&#x27;re doing that really matters, we should be able to have a lot more variation and flexibility when we think about what work could be. Different types of schedules, different number of hours, less intensity, more breaks, or hey,</p>
<p>maybe more key work and you produce more value but less make work. There&#x27;s a lot of options on the table here, but these studies, I think, point to this really key thing. You are not most of what you&#x27;re doing in your job is probably not actually that directly useful. That&#x27;s taking place in less total time than you think, which means you should feel some cover to actually uh slow down and take a breath. Interesting. 4 day work week. You know what type of work week Network runs? &gt;&gt; Two. &gt;&gt; 14 minutes. [laughter] He gets after it. Deep work, deep laser</p>
<p>focus. 14 minutes. And you know what? He gets a round of applause for it. Cal Network is so impressive that when uh he attends the theater, when the show is over, the actors applaud him. Get some Cal Network. That&#x27;s kind of that&#x27;s a catchphrase. Get some. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; get some Cal Network. So, there we go. Interesting research. I think this we kind of slept on this this 4 day work week stuff because a lot of it kind of was coming in the immediate post-pandemic times. enough other stuff on our on our minds. &gt;&gt; But I think it&#x27;s a a scandalous result that they said, &quot;Hey, stop working a</p>
<p>week and nothing really changed with productivity.&quot; The message that we should get out of that is like, &quot;Oh my god, what are we doing during this time then?&quot; Like clearly we have a lot of make work and non-promotable activities going on. Like we should be able to be better. We don&#x27;t think enough about workloads. Hey, if you like this video, I think you&#x27;ll really like this one as well. Check it out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Despite some initial skepticism, Jonathan Haidt’s crusade against kids using smartphones has been more or less completely vindicated. Which got us thinking: what’s he worried about next? In the ideas segment, Cal looks closer at three new technological harms that Haidt has begun sounding the alarm about. Then, in the practices segment, he details a somewhat eccentric technology strategy that he and his wife have deployed in their own home to keep their kids away from smartphones.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLmP8zql9E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLmP8zql9E</a></p>
<h2>What’s worrying Jon Haidt?</h2>
<p>Two years ago, the NYU social scientist Jonathan Height exploded into the public conversation with the publication of his book, The Anxious Generation. This book argued that smartphones had helped trigger a mental health epidemic in kids and teenagers. Now, this book was a massive bestseller. It sold over a million copies by the end of 2024 and many more since. Now, the anxious generation was a hit in large part because height was giving data to back up something that most parents already felt intuitively. They saw what happened</p>
<p>to their own kids when they got their hands on their phones. They knew that it was a problem. And John Height had the receipts to prove that they were right. Not everyone, however, immediately embraced Height&#x27;s message. Many elite journalists and academics were suspicious. uh they thought his message was too simple and it was too neat and that it diverted attention from the types of harms like uh structural racism and economic inequality that they were more interested in highlighting. Um a dismissive review of the anxious generation that appeared in the journal Nature for example claimed that Height&#x27;s</p>
<p>argument was quote not supported by science end quote and then warned that quote rising hysteria could distract us from tackling the real causes end quote. But these critics had a problem. height knew what he was talking about. Starting in 2019, he began constructing with the help of the demographer uh Gene Twangi and the researcher Zach Roush a massive annotated bibliography of every serious paper published about the impact of phones on teens. In fact, I&#x27;ll load this bibliography on the screen right now for</p>
<p>people who are watching instead of just listening. What I&#x27;m showing you right now, this is just a table of contents of all the different studies that are in here. These are all just categories of studies. And if you look in here a little bit closer, you&#x27;ll see uh they&#x27;re summarizing for all these studies. Uh they&#x27;ll have a summary of what&#x27;s going on. They&#x27;ll have the abstract. They&#x27;ll have comments, reactions to the studies, reactions to people responding to it, key graphs from within it, etc. What I&#x27;m trying to say here is height had become one of the world&#x27;s experts on this research literature. So he wasn&#x27;t just</p>
<p>going with his gut when he wrote the anxious generation. The harms he described were very carefully and in a nuanced fashion being measured by real researchers. Now, here&#x27;s the thing. Soon after The Anxious Generation came out, it became harder and harder to ignore the reality that height seemed like he was right. One of the clearest validations was when last year many schools began banning phones and they saw immediate positive improvements not just in learning but in their kids social interactions and in their mental health. So, we are currently arriving at a moment in which John Height, for all</p>
<p>intents and purposes, has been vindicated. Perhaps nothing captures this more clearly than uh the following tweet that I&#x27;m going to show you here on the screen. I&#x27;ll load it up here. Uh this is from the technology journalist Kevin Roose, who has long been in the John Height skeptic camp, but just recently he tweeted the following. I confess I was not totally convinced that the phone bands would work, but early evidence suggests a total John Height victory. The link in this tweet was to an article in New York Magazine, another former hotbed of anti-Hight sentiment that was</p>
<p>titled, &quot;How the phone ban uh saved high school.&quot; Now, all this leads to the following conclusion. when it comes to kids and phones, height was ahead of the curve in noticing the dangers and he was right about the warnings he raised. All right, so this story by itself is interesting, but to me it also points to a really urgent and important follow-up question. If height was so precient about phones, what technologies worry him now? This is what I want to explore in today&#x27;s idea</p>
<p>segment. Uh, we went back through all of the articles that height has published since the anxious generation came out and we pulled out three new technologies that height and his collaborators are worried about. Right? So, if you want to sidestep the next big tech disaster either in your own life, the life of your kids, then you need to listen to this segment. And then when we&#x27;re done with that and we move on to our practices segment, I&#x27;m going to turn the tension back to my own life. I&#x27;m going to bring you up to speed on some of the eccentric strategies that my wife and I have deployed to help uh avoid giving our own kids smartphones. And I&#x27;m going to give you a hint. The unifying thread</p>
<p>to these eentric strategies is our own childhood from the 1990s. All right, so we have a lot to get to today. As always, I&#x27;m Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about the fight for depth in an increasingly distracted world. We&#x27;ll get started right after the music. All right. So, we&#x27;re going to start here with the the first article that we pulled from Heights collection about a</p>
<p>new technological danger to be worried about. The title of this article is smartphone gambling is a disaster. We aren&#x27;t meant to have a casino in our pockets. This was actually written by two collaborators of height, Jonathan Cohen and Isaac Rose Burman. All right. So, what I&#x27;m going to do here is uh I have the article. I&#x27;ll have it on the screen for those who are watching instead of just listening. Um I&#x27;m going to go through some key ideas and numbers from this article that try to give you a sense of what&#x27;s going on here. So, let&#x27;s</p>
<p>start with the notion of the extent of the digital gambling problem. So, how much digital gambling is going on? So, I&#x27;m going to read here from the article. The advent of smartphones in 2007 and a smart Supreme Court decision in 2018 opened the door to fully frictionless 24/7 legal gambling. In the last 7 years, seven states have legalized online casino gambling known as i gaming. And 30 states plus Washington DC have legalized online sports betting.</p>
<p>Quasi legal forms of casino sports gambling have exploded across the country. Americans now gamble hundreds of millions of dollars a day on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel. Far more if you include lottery tickets, prediction markets, and mim or crypto speculation. All right, so that&#x27;s to say there is uh a lot more access to online gambling. Um let&#x27;s read about the numbers here. I want to get more specific. More money is being gambled because more people have gambling readily available. This is</p>
<p>particularly true for sports betting. 30% of American men and 22% of American women now have a sports betting account, including nearly half of men ages 18 to 49. A quarter of men and 12% of women now bet on sports three or more times a week. And an NCAA survey reported almost 70% of college students living on campus bet on sports. Let&#x27;s just sit with those numbers for a second because they&#x27;re actually quite staggering if we put those percentages into context. Think</p>
<p>about that. 30% of all men in America have a sports betting account. Uh if you go to 18 to 49, so you get rid of uh people who are older. For men that jumps up to half, half of men under 50 have a sports betting account. It is affecting younger people. the NCAA finding I really got to underscore that 70% of college students who live on campus are betting on sports. Right? So it we really got to emphasize the extent uh to which this has really become a massive a</p>
<p>massive activity in our country. All right, I want to give you a couple more stats here. They&#x27;re not available in as many states. I gaming and online lottery tickets are also gaining popularity. A recent report found that in Pennsylvania, which has online lottery tickets, i gaming and online sports betting um which has on oh which has online lottery tickets, i gaming and online sports betting, the number of online gamblers nearly doubled between 2001 and 2024 and only 40% of betterers were gambling on sports. Online gambling of all types is most prevalent among young people. A 2022 uh National Council on Problem Gambling</p>
<p>press release reported that 60% of high schoolers had gambled in the last year. All right. Um this is a big deal as 60% of high schoolers have gambled in the last year. All right. So let&#x27;s try to figure out why this is happening. Um, Height and his collaborators here point to a couple uh, powerful reasons. All right, I&#x27;m going to read from the article again. Beyond easier access, much of the increase in online gambling is due to</p>
<p>the fact that gambling companies have engineered their games to be ever more difficult to resist. They feature the same behavioral nudges and dopamine delivery mechanisms as social media platforms. These are not your grandparents uh, slot machines. All right, it&#x27;s important we put these two factors together. Factor number one is accessibility. It would not have been the case 20 years ago that 60% of high schoolers had gambled because that would involve them somehow getting on a Greyhound bus and making their way to Atlantic City and sneaking into a casino and going up to a blackjack table. And I guess they would have to maybe stand on each other&#x27;s</p>
<p>shoulders with a trench coat to act like they&#x27;re older to place their bet. There&#x27;s a huge amount of friction. But once it moved to your phone and the phone is just like, &quot;Are you are you 18?&quot; Right? You&#x27;re like, &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Of course.&quot; uh 60% suddenly have gambled. 70% of college students are gambling because the phone made it much more easier. Again, 70% of college students weren&#x27;t going to go all the way out the foxwoods to try to go to the slot machines. But if it&#x27;s on your phone, why not? The other problem, which we just emphasized here, is that the gambling itself once it has moved on the phones meant they could use, as we just read, the same behavioral nudges and</p>
<p>dopamine delivery mechanisms as other types of highly engaging activities, except for now there&#x27;s real money on the line. Let me read you a little bit more about this. Every part of a gambling app is designed to be fun, easy to use, and hard to quit. After a cursory age verification process, basically non-existent on some unregulated sites, betterers can deposit money as easily as buying anything else online. The apps have their own version of endless scroll with a constantly updating menu of things to bet on. Fine-tuned personalization serves up anything from</p>
<p>Charles Barklay&#x27;s parlay of the day to Baywatch theme slots. And whenever users spend uh a while away from the app, carefully time push notifications, lure them back on for one more uh spin scroll or bet. You know what I&#x27;m going to do here? Let&#x27;s load up an actual web page of a gambling website. So, here&#x27;s the FanDuel website. Let&#x27;s get a little sense of like what this actually looks like. Look at this. Huff, huff, even more puff. Uh, here&#x27;s a bet. B bet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if you win.</p>
<p>So, there&#x27;s lots of things pushing it here. Five 500 bonus spins, but plus get up to $1,000 back in casino bonuses. So, they&#x27;re really pushing a lot of things here. If I click on the casino link, um, which I think is crazy. Uh, don&#x27;t allow. Okay, here we go. Um, they got a casino link here where you can basically if you I put this on the screen here, Jesse, you can play blackjack. You can do spinning the wheel things. You can do uh slot machines. Crazy. Just all from your phone. You can bet all sorts of bets on sports. You can</p>
<p>do fantasy teams and put money on the line. You can bet live on horse races. You can play against real people for cash. I mean, there&#x27;s just endless ways here that looks really fun and interesting on this website to try to get you uh to actually bet uh to bet money. So, these things are, we have to admit, really compelling. All right, so what are the harms here? Well, let me read a little bit more. Um, gambling companies have spinned heavily to attract new customers. Since</p>
<p>legalization began in 2018, sports books have bombarded Americans with ads, paid celebrities to promote their products, and given away billions in new user promos. The message, gambling is easy, fun, and a quick way to make life more exciting. This marketing drives cultural normalization. that transforms this what was once a vice into a common daily habit, something that everyone does or should do. So, we got a lot of things coming together here which are not great, right? It&#x27;s more accessible than ever before. Um,</p>
<p>we have it more accessible than ever before. It&#x27;s more addictively designed than ever before. And then we have a lot of ads that normalizes behaviors before like, hey, everyone should be doing this. And we&#x27;ve all heard these ads because they dominate now. For example, you&#x27;ve probably heard this Jesse, like all sports coverage. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All sports coverage is dominating from these ads. Podcast ads, you see them uh you see them basically everywhere. So what can we do about this this harm number one that height and his collaborators are pointing us towards? Well, let&#x27;s break up our recommendations into the societal level and the personal level. Um at the societal level, they recommend and I would agree with</p>
<p>this. There really shouldn&#x27;t be online casino games. You can regulate and control games like blackjack, light slot machines, etc. much better when people have to go to a physical building and there&#x27;s friction involved. You got to actually drive and you got to park and you have to walk in and you have to go and you have to either get chips or get money out of the machine and put it onto a card and you have to sit down next to like the the the old lady pounding free oldfashions or genetonics next to you. It&#x27;s a little bit depressing and there&#x27;s cigarette smoke in the air and you&#x27;re actually there in this room and then when you leave the room you&#x27;re away from it and you can&#x27;t be doing the activity.</p>
<p>That friction, even though we have plenty of problem gamblers, that friction has uh made it such that the number of people gambling regularly was like relatively small and that was probably better and you would do it every once in a while. We shouldn&#x27;t allow those type of pure chance games to be accessible by a phone. That probably should just be banned. For online sports betting, there needs to be way more guard rails here. This is sort of an unregulated, it&#x27;s semi-regulated, but it&#x27;s really the wild west what they can do. Um, we should be careful about what advertising is allowed to be done. Parents and teachers need to actually talk about online gambling to kids. I&#x27;m going to read a quote here from the</p>
<p>article. Just as parents and teachers know it&#x27;s important to talk to kids about drugs, alcohol, sex, social media, and pornography, they need to discuss gambling in the ways it can get its hooks into the brain. So, it should be just as much of a conversation as other technologies. What about on the personal level? My main recommendation, which I think is backed up by the authors of this article as well, is don&#x27;t gamble online. You need to recognize that the house always wins. You are not good at it. You are just giving your money away at a much higher rate than you ever would do if it was being made clear.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a point that I really want to emphasize, especially to my young men listeners who think that they&#x27;re uh sports betting geniuses. There&#x27;s a really good series, I don&#x27;t know if you heard this one, Jesse, that Michael Lewis did on his podcast about online gambling. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I listened to some of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, here&#x27;s the main takeaway message I got from that. you&#x27;re not allowed to win. Like if they see you&#x27;re starting to make money on your bets, they cancel your account. They kick you off the service. They&#x27;re allowed to do that. So if you have not been kicked off of your sports betting service, they&#x27;re making a lot of money off of you. By</p>
<p>definition, if you&#x27;re able to use it, you&#x27;re bad at it. And the people who actually know how to do professional sports bank get kicked off. The only way they make money, and this is what Lewis gets into in that series, is by having an elaborate series of of fake individuals that they hire to go place a small number of careful bets on their behalf and then share the winnings with them. Um, you as yourself, if you get any even like a string of luck, they&#x27;re going to kick you right off of that app. You are not good at gambling, you are just handing bills to these very, very large entertainment companies. So, I would say just don&#x27;t online gamble at</p>
<p>all. Uh, that would probably be the safest. Let&#x27;s take a quick break to hear from our sponsors. It&#x27;s easy to assume that being small means flying under the radar. But the reality is that small businesses are being targeted more and more by bad actors as cyber criminals know that lean teams often lack the resources to prevent or respond to a breach. But here&#x27;s the good news. Even the smallest teams can foil a cyber crime if they use one password. One password provides</p>
<p>simple security to help small teams manage the number one risk that bad actors exploit, weak passwords. It does so by providing centralized management to make sure your company&#x27;s login secure. It&#x27;s a simple turnkey solution that could be rolled out in hours whether you have a dedicated IT staff or not. But don&#x27;t let one password&#x27;s name fool you. They&#x27;re not just a password manager. One password enterprise password manager lets you securely store and share developer secrets and other sensitive data. Can also help streamline the transition to passwordless authentication by transitioning to pass</p>
<p>keys. So take the first step to better security by securing your team&#x27;s credentials. Find out more at onepass.com/deep and start securing every login.

<p>the show. All right. Um, let&#x27;s move on to the second concern that is bothering Height and his collaborators right now, and that has to do with online multiplayer games. So, the article I&#x27;m loading up here is from July, and it&#x27;s titled, &quot;It&#x27;s not just a game anymore. How new monetization models change gaming and what parents need to know.&quot; This is written by Bennett Sipple and Zach Rouse. Zach Roush is is Height&#x27;s longtime collaborator, research scientist at his lab at NYU. All right, I&#x27;m going to start</p>
<p>by reading a thought experiment that they use to open this article. So, uh, bear with me here, but I think it it emphasizes a really important point. All right, so I&#x27;m I&#x27;m reading here. Imagine that your 8-year-old son comes home buzzing with excitement about a brand new amusement park that just opened Neo Park. He heard about it at school and his friends say it&#x27;s amazing. Apparently kids running around uh between uh apparently kids are running around between thousands of rides, all of which are free. All right, I&#x27;m going to skip ahead here, but essentially to keep the the story going, it&#x27;s like you decide to</p>
<p>to log into this go to this free amusement park with your son. All right, continuing the the story here. You oblige, close your eyes, and in an instant, you&#x27;re inside a vast world of glowing gates, wild challenges, and endless rides. There are no lines and no closing time. You later notice that there are no guards, no police, and nobody in charge. The park is bright, loud, and chaotic. People sprint between portals, tank battles, danceoff, fantasy quest, each with different rules. The park runs on its own currency, which kids spend on flash deals, mystery boxes, and spinning wheels, promising rare prizes. Everyone is wearing a full body suit that makes them look like a</p>
<p>cartoon character, and everyone is the same size. Everyone is wearing a mask, so you can&#x27;t tell who anyone is or how old they are. Many seem to be wandering aimlessly around the park, striking up conversations with anyone they can find. One person who appears, judging by his movement patterns, likely an adult male, picks up your son, carries him towards a nearby ride, and then asks for his phone number. Another invites him to a workshop just outside the park. Some rides are clearly meant for adults, and some, but not all, of these rides have signs stating minimum ages, but there&#x27;s nobody around to enforce those limits. So, children as young as your son can be</p>
<p>found on every ride. In one game that you wander into with your son, you&#x27;re trained to hide a dead body after a murder. Your son then enters a game by himself and requests a private therapy session from another guest at the park. In the next one, you see a group of people holding Nazi flags next to what looks like a concentration camp. In another, you enter a classroom and find a teacher having sex with a student. In the last game, you wander into a shooter with an AK-47 opens fire in an elementary school. The park is always changing. The haunted house that you saw an hour before has been replaced by a dating game. The pirate ride adds a</p>
<p>stripper pole beneath the poop deck while you&#x27;re exploring the ship. 6 hours pass and you&#x27;re ready to go. Your son is redeyed and begging for one more ride. You tell him he doesn&#x27;t have a choice. It&#x27;s dinner time. You walk to the exit gate and w back up in the dim room. All right, I&#x27;m skipping ahead again. This is insane. You think? Who would let their children play at a place like this? As surreal as it sounds, this isn&#x27;t entirely a fictional story. It&#x27;s a glimpse into what millions of kids experience daily in today&#x27;s most popular online games. In fact, every disturbing</p>
<p>game we mentioned in our story is an actual game that exists or that recently existed on Roblox, and most parents have never stepped inside. All right, I&#x27;m going to load up on the screen here again. There&#x27;s a few uh pictures in here. This is like a picture here, Jesse. This is from the hide the dead body game. This is from within uh Roblox. This here is a picture of what looks like Roblox characters carrying Nazi flags. This is a screenshot taken from within a Roblox game. Here&#x27;s a concentration camp. That&#x27;s also pictures taken from within a Roblox game. Um this</p>
<p>is really happening. This is what these games are like. And a lot of parents uh don&#x27;t know this. I can&#x27;t tell you how many conversations I&#x27;ve had where parents assume, for example, that um Roblox must be like Minecraft or Legos because it has the word box in the name, not realizing that no, no, there&#x27;s something much darker going on. All right, so I&#x27;m going to return to the article here and read a little bit more because they&#x27;re going to establish the this key transition that has happened in the world of games that we need to be aware of. They said video games have been around since the late 1950s, but</p>
<p>something shifted during the first decade of the 2000s. As the bandwidth and speed of the internet grew rapidly alongside the rise of early social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, a new type of video game emerged, one that didn&#x27;t end. Instead of offering a fixed storyline or campaign, these games kept evolving. They were built on a new model called games as a service where games were continuously updated with new content, features, and events to keep players engaged and coming back. These games were typically, but not always, freeto play, at least when you started, and they were in sharp</p>
<p>contrast to the games that came before, which were typically sold as discrete complete products with a beginning, middle, and end. So, there&#x27;s been a change to what video games actually mean. Now, within uh this world of these new games, the king, at least when it comes to young users of these games as service games is Roblox. Let me give you a couple statistics here from the story. Games built on the now dominant game as a series model, is outperforming all other video games in history, especially when it comes to use by miners.</p>
<p>Minecraft and Fortnite each attract roughly 30 million monthly active users under the age of 18 from around the world. Both are dwarfed by Roblox which currently host about 304 million MAU under 18. So 10 times more. According to Roblox&#x27;s own reports documented by the New York Times, as of 2020, about 75% of Us children ages 9 to 12 were active users of the platform as of 2024 as 65% of parents with children under 14 report their child plays</p>
<p>Roblox. Jesse, these are amazing numbers. This Roblox game, Minecraft&#x27;s popular, Fortnite&#x27;s popular, but Roblox is played by most young kids in America. And I just described to you what is in this world. It is user created games that you can bounce between. You have no idea what&#x27;s in these games. Most a lot of these users are adults. Content moderation is basically impossible to enforce because there&#x27;s millions of different of these portals being made. And 75% of US kids between age 9 and 12 are in this world. I think that is uh astounding. We got</p>
<p>some uh statistics here about game playing time. So, we see uh on average, boys spend two and a half times as many hours gaming per day as girls do. 40% of boys report playing every day as compared to just 10% of girls. Um, beyond time spent, male players are three times as likely as girls to make in-game purchases and more than twice as likely to identify as gamers. So, there is definitely a gender split here where we got uh 40% of boys are playing these games every single day. All right. So, what are our concerns? I mean,</p>
<p>obviously, we have the concern of all that like terrible stuff that you might see in these games, but let&#x27;s get more specific. There&#x27;s kind of a tour of different concerns we have to worry about. The first concern has to do with just the amount of time this takes away from kids. I want to give you some numbers here from the article I&#x27;m reading now. According to a recent Common Sense Media report, 8 to 12 year olds spend an average of two hours and 18 minutes per day playing video games in 2019. And that increased to 2 hours and 27 minutes in 2021. Let&#x27;s just think about what we just said there. The average uh 8 to 12year-old playing video</p>
<p>games is going to spend 2 and 1/2 hours per day. It&#x27;s a lot of time. Uh a 2015 report found that one in three boys and one in 10 girls in this age group played at least two hours daily with 10% of boys exceeding four hours. Among older adolesccents 20 to 18, a 2021 survey found that 57% of boys and 36% of girls reported gaming for at least three and a half hours per day. So when we go to 12 to 18 year olds, almost 60% of boys are playing more than three and a half hours</p>
<p>of these games per day, right? That is not optimal. Can that lead to addiction? It can indeed. I want to give you another stat here. I&#x27;m reading again from the article. A 2018 meta analysis estimated that 4.6% of adolescence met the criteria for internet gaming disorder or IGD. that goes up to 6.8% if you&#x27;re considering male adolescence. Uh when we jump forward four years to 2022, a meta analysis found that 8.8% of</p>
<p>adolescence met the criteria for IGD. When we break that down by sex, we find that it&#x27;s 15.4% of males overall meet the criteria for this internet gaming disorder. So the most recent uh data we have says you have 15% of adolescent males who qualify they meet the criteria for having an addiction to internet games. This seems like something that uh we should care about. All right, here&#x27;s another problem. Again, I&#x27;m reading from the article. A 2018 survey of 2865</p>
<p>adolescent gamers found that 13% had played gambling style games online. One survey found that in 2019, 43.7% of eighth grade boys purchased a loot box in the past year and that rose to 48.6% in 2022. In other words, half of eighth grade boys are gaining practice and familiarity with gambling. I think Jesse, a loot box is you buy a box, you pay for it, you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, and then once you pay for it, it&#x27;s like a slot machine. It might be really cool gear, it might be nothing. So, it&#x27;s a sort of gambling situation. Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, I&#x27;ll load a a screenshot up here on the screen. This is the type of stuff that kids are seeing in the game, right? So, these are different things you can buy. So, for like $49.99, you get 200,000 VC in a VC pack. I don&#x27;t even know what that is, right? But this is you&#x27;re constantly being uh given opportunities to buy. And a lot of those purchases are uh put in a sort of gambling styleless situation. All right. All those are problems. It&#x27;s addictive. You&#x27;re exposed to gambling. Kids are</p>
<p>playing these games all the time. Let&#x27;s get to the more worrisome stuff that we hinted at in that opening case study. I&#x27;m going to go back to the article here and read some disturbing statistics. 10% of teen girls have been sent unwanted sexually explicit content while gaming. Various exposees have been published on the migration of predators, the migration of predators to online games, such as one NY New York Times article titled, &quot;Video games and online chats are hunting grounds for sexual predators.&quot; In 2023, Roblox reported over 13,000 instances of</p>
<p>child exploitation on its platform and over,300 law enforcement requests related to such cases. There&#x27;s all sorts of bad stuff happening in these games. Here&#x27;s some more information about that. Roblox, I&#x27;m reading here, Roblox has a poor track record with content moderation in part because 70% of Roblox experiences are user created. For example, in the 3-month period of Q4 2023, Roblox users generated and uploaded approximately 25</p>
<p>billion total pieces of content to the platform and has.77 moderators per 100,000 users to moderate that content. Now, surprisingly, a 2023 multinational survey of adolescent gamers found that 51% of all gamer surveys had come across extremist content, hate-based harassment or incitement to discrimination and violence in online games. Some more pictures here. Uh, these are more examples of Nazi villages and propaganda that you can just stumble</p>
<p>across in Roblox. This is not good. These games are too big to be fully content moderated. Um, and because of that, you are getting uh quite a lot of exploitative or predatory or extremist encounters with information. Now, here&#x27;s a side note that a lot of parents miss. Um, when you&#x27;re playing a game like Roblox or in particular a game like Minecraft or Fortnite online, the kids might tell you, &quot;Oh, the chats you you can&#x27;t really communicate with the players in the game. Like, the chat&#x27;s</p>
<p>turned off. It&#x27;s all safe.&quot; But what teenagers are doing and even younger, but like especially boys, is they&#x27;re using separate services to chat with the people they&#x27;re playing on. So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re using in particular things like Discord, which is a voice chat server. So they&#x27;re logging into a Discord server so they can be talking with the people they&#x27;re playing with. And even services like Minecraft that says, &quot;Oh, we try to uh detect and not allow people to use Discord when they&#x27;re playing our game.&quot; the people just get these custom mods that update the program so that they can be talking with the people that they&#x27;re playing with using a separate Discord</p>
<p>server. But the part the problem is these chat servers are completely unregulated and moderated. Anyone can set them up. I&#x27;m going to read here. This is not up on the screen, but I just pulled this from another part uh of the article. Gaming chats have become the new boys locker room. For many boys, this locker room is their only place to talk smack, blow off steam, and bomb. Normal adolescent behaviors. But when the locker room has anonymity, no walls, and anyone is allowed in, the stakes change. Porn is easy to find and easy to share. In these unfiltered and unregulated spaces, adult contact, children, and extreme content can flow</p>
<p>freely. Beastiality, violent porn, animal abuse, self harm, stabbings, and an array of extremist ideologies to name a few. So, they&#x27;re hearing all this stuff while you walk in, you see their headsets on, and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, look, they&#x27;re mining diamonds in Minecraft. Isn&#x27;t that fun?&quot; And this is what&#x27;s going on in their ears. Uh, it was actually these Discord chat servers where, as far as we can tell, the murderer of Charlie Kirk was radicalized into a sort of weird online sort of groper troll space was the chats that went along with video games. So, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>like an extra danger that we have to add in there. Man, I wish there was we were done with the bad things that happened, but there&#x27;s more things we have to worry about. Let me read something else from the article. Heavy gaming is associated with elevated risks of depression. One study of over 200,000 adolescence found a curvy linear relationship between gaming and mental health. Light gaming, less than 1 hour per day, was not associated with harm, while heavy gaming, five or more hours per day, was linked to a higher risk of depression. That risk began increasing after just one hour of use per day. Another problem</p>
<p>is sleep. Heavy gaming is tied to problematic sleep outcomes, which in turn can contribute to negative impacts on sustained attention, academic performance. 45% of boys and 37% of girls who game report that video games hurt their sleep and 21% of boys and 11% of girls report that it hurts how well they do in school. This is a huge amount of problems. It&#x27;s all associated with this thing that most parents don&#x27;t even really think about. And if you&#x27;re a little bit older, you&#x27;re maybe underestimating. You&#x27;re like,</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I hang out with my buddies and we play a lot of video games.&quot; You&#x27;re maybe underestimating these harms. I mean, we&#x27;re we have exploitation, we have predatorship, we have huge amounts of time. Imagine it&#x27;s three to four hours of time per day is being taken up into uh these games. You&#x27;re being exposed to gambling. You&#x27;re being exposed to extremist ideologies. You&#x27;re in these Discord or Twitch chat rooms, which is exposed to all this sorts of crazy stuff. It is like a carnival of terribleness that we&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s okay because like the game has the word blocks in its title.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s negligent. Kids should not be playing these games. So, what should we do about it?&quot; Well, here&#x27;s what the authors of uh Heights Collaborator suggest. We need serious age verification requirements for these games as service, these free online games that we have enforcement on. Kids should not be allowed into these free-to-play online games, especially those with user created content. Here&#x27;s my suggestion to parents. If you have kids that still live at home, here&#x27;s the rule. You may not play a video game where you might see, encounter, or otherwise collaborate with someone who</p>
<p>you don&#x27;t know. There is no Fortnite, no multiplayer Minecraft, certainly no Roblox, no World of Warcraft. Keep the video games you let your kids play to those that you have to pay $40 or more for and you stick it into a video game playing machine and you play it for about 40 hours until you&#x27;re done and it&#x27;s just you playing the game by yourself. Here&#x27;s my suggestion to gamers, whether you&#x27;re young or you know you&#x27;re in your 20s or something. Avoid freetoplay games, right? They are going to take a massive amount of your time. And I can tell you if you&#x27;re like a young man,</p>
<p>there are so many better uses of three to four hours a day than being in Fortnite or in World of Warcraft. There are so many things you could be spending that time on right now that&#x27;s going to give you compounding interest style returns in your life going forward. Like doing the type of things that makes you good in your job or attractive to potential mates or connected to communities or building up a sense of leadership. All of that is so much more important than I&#x27;m in hour four of like customizing my skin for my Roblox world. Do not play free-to-play games. Finally, I feel like Roblox just</p>
<p>shouldn&#x27;t exist. I think it&#x27;s a predator circus. 75% of American kids are in this thing that&#x27;s full of all this inappropriate content that we can&#x27;t control. If you can&#x27;t control it, you can&#x27;t have you can&#x27;t have kids. Shut that down. I I don&#x27;t even think that should exist. All right. So, if you&#x27;re patting yourself on your back because your kids don&#x27;t have uh smartphones, that&#x27;s good. You listen to height, but you need to listen to him on this issue as well and be very wary about the video games. All right, but Jesse, we got one final concern that height and his collaborators have been pointing to recently, and it involves AI. I&#x27;m going to load up this article</p>
<p>here. I&#x27;ll lead read you the the title. It says, &quot;Don&#x27;t give your child any AI companions. Some dangers are already clear. others won&#x27;t be known for many years. This came out a couple months ago. It was written by John along with Zack Roush. All right, so this is a little bit quicker because it&#x27;s a newer problem, but nothing nonetheless important. All right, I&#x27;m going to read you here a quote from the article. AI chatbots and companions are the next uncontrolled mass experiment that Silicon Valley wants to perform on the world&#x27;s</p>
<p>children. as some of the same companies that push social media into childhood with little concern for children&#x27;s safety are building and promoting these chat bots, putting them into dolls and stuffed animals that and they are positioning their products as friends, confidants, and therapists. Don&#x27;t buy into it. All right, so are kids actually using these things? I have an alarming statistic for you. Again, reading from the article, a 2025 Common Sense Media survey found that 72% of US teens have used an AI companion at least once, and more than half use them multiple times a</p>
<p>month. Early research, journalistic investigations, and internal documents show that these AI systems are already engaging in sexualized interactions with children and offering inappropriate or danger dangerous advice, including uh syncopantically encouraging young people who are considering suicide to proceed. As Chad GBT put it in one young man&#x27;s final conversation with it, cold steel pressed against a mind that&#x27;s already made peace. That&#x27;s not fear, that&#x27;s clarity. So young people are using these chat bots as companions and we have we know</p>
<p>all sorts of bad stuff is happening and we don&#x27;t even have our arms around all the possibility of the harms. This is brand new. An interesting thing about this is it&#x27;s not just people logging into a website like chatbt.com. Now there&#x27;s a push to put chatbot access into toys with vocalization so that kids can have conversations with their toys. Well, you can imagine how this is going. I&#x27;m going to load up an unrelated article here. It&#x27;s from the website Futurism. Oh god, the title, Jesse, is AI powered toys caught telling 5-year-olds how to</p>
<p>find knives and start fires with matches. Um, this isn&#x27;t great. Let me read something from this article here. New research shows exactly how this fusion of kids toys and loquacious AI models can go horrifically wrong in the real world. They write, &quot;After testing three different toys powered by AI, researchers from the US Public Interest Research Group found that the play things can easily verge into risky conversational territory for children, including telling them where to find knives in a kitchen and how to start fire with matches. One of the AI toys</p>
<p>even engaged in explicit discussions offering extensive advice on sex positions and fetishes. I think there was the when we were kids, the only toy that would do that was the the not as popular um BSDM version of Teddy Ruxpin. I don&#x27;t know if you had that one. &gt;&gt; No, I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was it was kind of a shortlived toy. It didn&#x27;t have as much of an audience, but I guess now we&#x27;re going to get more of that. &gt;&gt; Um all right, none of this is good. Now, to make matters even worse, we don&#x27;t even know how to control these um even if we wanted to. Right? So, I&#x27;m going to</p>
<p>quote here from the article. Nobody can really I&#x27;ll use my Kyler. Nobody can really explain why chatbots do the things they do. Large language models are not programmed by human beings in the same way that video games or spreadsheet software are. Like the human brain, they develop over time as they are fed vast quantities of training data. They behave in unexpected ways, often will not respond the same way to identical question, and sometimes reveal information or patterns that were hidden in their training data. All right, so we&#x27;ve talked about this a lot on the show before. Language models by definition are uh very unpredictable. It&#x27;s hard to control them. You can&#x27;t</p>
<p>just say, &quot;Hey, make sure you don&#x27;t talk about this topic.&quot; That&#x27;s not the way they operate. They operate by producing tokens that extend the story they&#x27;re given in a way that they think the original story was originally written. They don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re creating new text. They think they&#x27;re trying to create finished text that was written before. And because they&#x27;ve seen a lot of different text about a lot of different things, including a lot of unsavory text, that effort can make them go in difficult directions. attempts to control them are very very crude fine-tuning attempts where you give them examples of answers and bad responses and say don&#x27;t do that. But those only cover so much if conversation veers away from very specific patterns they saw</p>
<p>during training uh during this fine-tuning then they can easily still end up in really dangerous places or something looks good the first time and then the next time it goes somewhere really dangerous. All right. So what are the recommendations about kids and generative AI tools? John Height has very stark advice in this article. I&#x27;ll quote it here. My message to parents is simple. Do not give your children any AI companions or toys. That&#x27;s all in caps locks. When John writes that, he then goes on to say, give them toys, sporting equipment, experiences that will strengthen their in-person relationships</p>
<p>rather than replacing them. I&#x27;m going to expand this advice as well because a lot of parents want to know about their kids and this new AI tools. And I would say children should not be using chat bots without adult supervision. And that goes for adolescence as well. This idea that they have to learn the technologies that they need to success in, you know, succeed in the 21st economy. This is nonsense. Chat bots by definition are dead simple to use. It takes about 6 seconds to figure it out. They don&#x27;t need to practice by being alone with these chat bots for hours at a time. And the technology built around these is changing drastically. And so what&#x27;s relevant when a 14-year-old is in college or in the job market is going to</p>
<p>be completely different than using, you know, uh, anthropic tool today. So, no, don&#x27;t buy this argument of, hey, you can&#x27;t keep kids from this technology they need to know how to use. They don&#x27;t need to be alone on chat bots. I mean, kids are going to have to drive cars eventually as well. I don&#x27;t want my 12-year-old behind my Chevy Tahoe. Um, AI based on LLMs, you know, look, this will be integrated in more focused ways and products going forward. So, again, learning how to chat with existing chat bots isn&#x27;t really going to help you. Kids don&#x27;t need the productivity gains of AI either. if they&#x27;re writing a paper or working on a homework assignment, the</p>
<p>whole point of that paper homework assignment is to stretch their brain and be hard. They don&#x27;t need to be having shortcuts. So, I would I think this needs to be until proven innocent. This is the way that we need to think about chat bots. Kids shouldn&#x27;t be on there unless they&#x27;re with a parent doing uh the parent is over their shoulder and they&#x27;re doing something very specific. Uh John is, I think, really clear about that in his research as well. All right. So, what&#x27;s my conclusion to this survey of what John Height&#x27;s worried about? Now, we didn&#x27;t see smartphones and social media coming. Smartphones were at first very super useful. Social media</p>
<p>was fun and truly social, and it all seems so inevitable. Of course, this technology is going to be used by everyone at all times. But then these tools slowly morphed when we weren&#x27;t paying attention. The social media companies realized they needed a return on their investment and they began to focus relentlessly on engagement. The technologies became addictive and mind warping and brought us to dangerous places. The kids to whom we casually gave these phones because at the time seemed harmless and useful became sucked into a childhood altering vortex of terribleness. Once we looked back in recent years, we were uh ended up to</p>
<p>quote the immortal Joe Bluth saying I think we&#x27;ve made a huge mistake. Now the point of the segment today and I think John height&#x27;s more work more generally is to help prevent us from stumbling into another style of tech a similar style of technological tragedy. We need to identify the next threat, technological threat that&#x27;s threatening to unravel the lives of us or the lives of our kids. And above all else, um there&#x27;s probably no escaping the conclusion that I made in my book, Deep Work, as well as in my book, Digital</p>
<p>Minimalism, that the only way to really do this is probably to make our default to be I don&#x27;t use the new technology. My kids don&#x27;t use the new technology. until I&#x27;ve had enough chance to see clear, unambiguous benefits, evidence that it&#x27;s not going to be</p>
<h2>Should you buy a landline (Cal just did…)</h2>
<p>overtly harmful, and I have a way to deploy it in their lives or my lives that&#x27;s going to maintain the good and get rid of the bad. This is what I think we need going forward. The default is no. You got to earn your way into my life or the life of my kids because we&#x27;ve seen time and again these things that there&#x27;s some pitch for, it&#x27;s cool, it&#x27;s high-tech, it&#x27;s new, it&#x27;s fun, end up with devastating consequences. So now the default really should be I don&#x27;t use a new technology or give it to my kid until it&#x27;s been around for a while and the evidence of its usefulness is really clear and I understand the harms and how to protect my kids from the harms and I</p>
<p>see that I can. And until you&#x27;ve done that work at convincing me, I don&#x27;t use it. We have to end the mindset that brought us into the social media phone problem era, which was just, hey, if something looks useful, kids need to know technology. Let&#x27;s just see what happens. We can always later add restrictions. That&#x27;s not the way we need to think about it, right? So only after a clear and compelling use case and evidence that uh technology presents no major harm should it be put into the lives in particular of our kids as the old saying goes fool me once shame on you but fool me twice as shame on me. All right so tech industry uh most of us and especially those of us</p>
<p>who are parents we&#x27;re on to you now you have to convince us that the things you&#x27;re producing are worth our time. You no longer get the benefit of just us trusting you to have created something cool. Well, that&#x27;s kind of a dark look at things, Jesse. It&#x27;s a walk down the lane of dark technology. So, basically, we learn like all kids are gambling while being pre uh while predators try to exploit them on Roblox as they dodge Nazis and then have um chat bots and their toys convincing them to burn down the house. &gt;&gt; Ferris had the Roblox co-founder on</p>
<p>November. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Listen to that. &gt;&gt; That thing&#x27;s ne Well, what did you take away from that conversation? I I think &gt;&gt; Did you listen to it? &gt;&gt; No. He talked a lot about his personal life for like the majority of the episode. Then he talked a little bit about &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t blame him for talking about his personal life. &gt;&gt; Well, he had like a issue with his his son. Like there was a big story with that. &gt;&gt; I mean, he created a pedophile circus and has 300 million kids a month using it under the age of 18. Like to me, that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the bigger story. So, I&#x27;m not surprised he didn&#x27;t want to talk about that. I mean, yeah, kids are easy to get engagement out of. You know, that&#x27;s what</p>
<p>these companies discovered. And so parents need to be like, &quot;We want nothing to do with any of you, right? Like, we&#x27;re going to be very, very cautious before we let something back into our lives.&quot; Let&#x27;s take a quick break to hear from our sponsors. Longtime listeners of the show know that I&#x27;m a big fan of Notion. Notion brings all of your notes, docs, and projects into one connected space that just works. It&#x27;s seamless, flexible, powerful, and actually fun to use. Now, I like Notion because you can build custom workflows for your team or even for your own personal life that can help you minimize distracting emails and</p>
<p>endless meetings, leaving more time for the deep work that actually matters. But recently, Notion has been up to something really interesting. They&#x27;re integrating AI into their already popular product. And with AI built right in, you can spend less time switching between tools and more time creating great work. Now, they&#x27;ve taken this initiative to a really impressive new place with the introduction of Notion Agent. With Notion Agent, your AI doesn&#x27;t just help with work, it finishes it. It can form a plan, then executed on your behalf, pulling data from your</p>
<p>Notion workspace, but also using other connected tools like Slack and Google Drive to complete your work in to end. There&#x27;s a reason why Notion is used by over 50% of Fortune 500 companies. You should consider using it. True. Try Notion now with Notion Agent at notion.com/cal. Now that&#x27;s all in lowercase letters. Notion.com/cal to try your new AI teammate notionag agent today. When you use our link, you&#x27;re supporting our show. That&#x27;s notion.com/cal. Now men, let me level with you. You need</p>
<p>to take better care of your skin. We&#x27;re trained to think about our muscles and our hairline and the awesome mustaches that our wives or girlfriends won&#x27;t let us grow. But we ignore our skin. And by the time we enter middle age, we realize that we suddenly look like Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character in the 1989 Batman movie right after he gets thrown into the acid bath. Jesse, I&#x27;m all about the uh really up-to-date references that the kids these days definitely get. But here&#x27;s the solution to this problem, man. Calira Lab. Calira Lab makes high performance skin care designed specifically for men&#x27;s skin. And more</p>
<p>importantly, they&#x27;ve simplified the use of their products into a straightforward three-step routine. Step one, you use Clean Slate, a cleanser to clear dirt, oil, and sweat off your skin. Step two, you use the Great, which is a serum clinically proven to reduce wrinkles um and to improve elasticity. Step three, you put on the hydrolayer moisturizer to lock in moisture all day. That&#x27;s it. Use those three products in those order. I have all three of these products, so I can tell you from experience, this routine is simple and it&#x27;s fast, but it works. It&#x27;s a small habit with big</p>
<p>results. So, go to calderab.com/deep and use code deep for 20% off your first order. All right, Jesse, let&#x27;s get back to the show. All right, that was our idea segment. That&#x27;s where we discuss big ideas about the fight for depth and attractive world. Now it is time for our practices segment where I talk about things that you can do in your own life to try to fight for that depth. So I think this is a good excuse to hear some theme music. All right. So to start off today&#x27;s</p>
<p>practice this segment, I want you to consider a thought experiment. Imagine that it&#x27;s the 1990s. This is when Jesse and I were growing up when we were kids. Uh and that one day I walked into my house wheeling like a media cart. And on this cart I had a television connected to a Sega Genesis. And on one side was a pouch that contained cigarettes. On the other side was a pouch containing a lot of pornographic magazines. And there was a radio next to it that was blaring like AM political talk radio. And on top of the TV was a phone. And I&#x27;m wandering by pushing this media cart. Um, as I head to my room in this thought experiment,</p>
<p>my mom correctly stops me and says, &quot;What the hell do you think you&#x27;re doing with all that?&quot; And then I answer calmly, &quot;Mom, there&#x27;s a phone on here. Do you not want me to be able to talk to my friends?&quot; Seen in that context, the situation would be ridiculous. But isn&#x27;t this exactly what&#x27;s happening today when we let an 11-year-old have a smartphone and all of the types of harms and negative externalities that introduces just because there&#x27;s like one or two single features on there that we&#x27;ve convinced ourselves or they&#x27;ve convinced us is somehow useful. Um, I want to play an</p>
<p>audio. This is a clip I played before. This is from uh smartphone free childhood. It&#x27;s a PSA they did. I want to play a quick clip here that makes that same point about my ridiculous experiment about the media cart is exactly what we&#x27;re doing when we give a kid a smartphone. Let&#x27;s hear the audio. This is a dad checking in on uh his elementary school age kid at bedtime. &gt;&gt; Hey kiddo, it&#x27;s about time for bed. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Well, remember there&#x27;s a box in the corner over there with all the pornographic material that&#x27;s ever been</p>
<p>made in the world. Even the really weird stuff that could scar you for life. I&#x27;m trusting you not to look in there. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Feelings are for losers. &gt;&gt; Oh, and this guy&#x27;s going to be in your corner all night just randomly spewing out hateful things. Just ignore them. Okay. While I&#x27;m thinking of it, there&#x27;s an order form on your desk where you can purchase illegal drugs. The mean girls from your school are going to be standing there talking about you all night. And this Russian hacker is going to keep asking for your password. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not hacker. Amazon customer service. &gt;&gt; Just need you to ignore them. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Love you, buddy. We ask too much of our kids when we give them a smartphone. Let&#x27;s change the norm together. &gt;&gt; Maybe we&#x27;ve gone around the &gt;&gt; All right. This is making the point I was just saying, which is like it&#x27;s pretty crazy the way that we turn a blind eye to all of the terribleness on these devices because there&#x27;s some reason, well, but my kid needs to tell me when his play practice is over. Like one reason we let them use all this stuff. We&#x27;re basically letting in my scenario me with my media cart full of all that stuff go into my room and bring that all with me. Now in the 1990s this</p>
<p>would have been ridiculous. Um but we also had an easy solution to the problem because all of these different bad technologies in my 1990s example were single use which made them easy to control or curate. So, in my scenario, if I had that media cart full of all that stuff, my mom would have be like, &quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.&quot; Okay, here&#x27;s what you can do. You can have the phone because I want you to be able to talk to your friends. No, you can&#x27;t have a TV in your room. Uh, we&#x27;ll have a TV out in the living room, and that&#x27;s where the video games are, and you can only play those</p>
<p>video games during times where we say you can play the video games, and you can&#x27;t have cigarettes, and you can&#x27;t have the porno magazines, and I don&#x27;t want you listening to the Rush Limba on the AM radio. Because everything is a separate technology, it is very easy to control and curate. In an age when all that&#x27;s pushed together into one device like a smartphone, things can seem kind of hopeless. So, can all we do is look back nostalgically at the &#x27;9s and say, &quot;Man, those were easier times.&quot; Not necessarily. All right. All right. So, in my own family, my wife and I have increasingly been seeking out modern singlepurpose</p>
<p>tools to replace specific functions that you might otherwise have been delivered through a smartphone. This is allowing us to help support our rule of no smartphones until high school by being able to use and deploy single-purpose technologies for specific things we think would be useful or enjoyable to our kids without having to give them the device that had everything else on it as well. So, here&#x27;s what I want to do in this practices segment today. Um, I want to talk about four different singleuse technologies, singlepurpose technologies that my wife and I actually have deployed with our kids in our life as</p>
<p>part of our strategy to not have to give them a Swiss Army knife style uh smartphone. All right. The first single-use technology, and this one we just got, and I&#x27;ll load this on the screen here for people who are watching, so just listening, is a 10 phone. A tin can phone is uh it&#x27;s a landline basically. It uses the internet but it is you can see this on the screen. Um it is an actual phone with a cord and it plugs into the wall and the receiver is connected to the base and when you pick it up there&#x27;s numbers on it and you can you know dial</p>
<p>numbers. They even have one that looks like an oldfashioned phone like from the &#x27;9s and that one uh is actually sold out. So, we now have this in our house for our kids to call or receive call from friends. Like my 13-year-old can like call one of his friends by dialing the number or they can call their cousins or they can call their grandparents if they want to talk to them. They can also receive calls on it. Yeah, you control everything through the app. So, you can say what numbers you&#x27;re allowed to come in. Also important, if my wife and I are out of the house, if we&#x27;re going for a walk or something like that and someone&#x27;s at home, they can call us from the home. If they have a</p>
<p>question or an issue, you can also call 911 from it. It&#x27;s what we used to have. Just a landline. It just uses the internet instead of copper wires, but it&#x27;s just like a landline like we used to have. A couple things I&#x27;ve noticed, Jesse, now that we&#x27;ve deployed the tin can phone. One, kids these days aren&#x27;t used to dialing phone numbers, right? Because it&#x27;s a lot of digits, right? Like we got kind of used to it. You have like the the the area code and then the exchange and D. They really struggle. They&#x27;re like, &quot;Wait, another number? Another number?&quot; they kind of lose their</p>
<p>train of thought. Like, they&#x27;ll have to dial a number a lot of times. Another thing I noticed, which I thought was interesting, is my my 13-year-old didn&#x27;t know how to use a wired phone handset. So, he called his friend and he was holding it like a speaker phone. He&#x27;s like, &quot;I can&#x27;t hear him.&quot; Because he didn&#x27;t know about like holding uh a phone, you know, it&#x27;s like, &quot;No, you got to hold it up like to your face.&quot; And then when he tried to do that, he hung up using his ear. So, he pushed it up against his face and hung up. So, they&#x27;re like they&#x27;re not used to using landlines. say we we take that for granted. Um, but they love having it and now they can have contact. We told our</p>
<p>oldest son, by the way, if he ends up using it a lot, we&#x27;re open to putting one in his room so he can have more private conversations with his friends and we can turn it off with an app and say, &quot;Yeah, but at like bedtime, it just shuts off.&quot; All right. Um, that is uh that&#x27;s how we use it. We use it for if you had a smartphone, you would make calls on the smartphone. Now, we use this landline instead. It&#x27;s a singlepurpose technology. One thing it can&#x27;t do is text. Uh the solution for the singlepurpose technology solution for texting in my opinion is to get an old iPad, like a refurbished iPad that&#x27;s</p>
<p>plugged in in your kitchen that you have an iMessage account logged into. And if you have a kid who wants to be a part of group uh chats, they can in the kitchen sit there on the iPad and check in on the chats and and and and add to it. They can&#x27;t have it in their own room. They have to be in the kitchen to do it. and they have to be subject to you could walk by and see what they&#x27;re chatting, right? Especially if they&#x27;re younger. That threat of like you don&#x27;t have complete privacy on here because God knows what you&#x27;re going to do. Helps sort of keep things more reasonable. My son, like a lot of boys like don&#x27;t care too much about it. They</p>
<p>do have some text chat uh threads. He he doesn&#x27;t care enough for us to set this up because it&#x27;s mainly just dumbness. Girls his age, from what I understand, are doing much more sort of sophisticated sort of social coordination on there. But that would be the solution I would give is here&#x27;s the the the group chat machine just like next to the telephone is the group chat iPad next to it in the kitchen. All right. So let me load up here the second single purpose technology we use. We have a punct pu n kt. I have this loaded up on the screen. So as you can see Jesse it is a old school cellular phone that only has numbers. You actually</p>
<p>press physical buttons one through nine. You have like a call and a hang up button and like a volume up and down button. What do we use our punked phone for? This is our single-use technology. If one of our kids is going somewhere where they might need to contact us when away from the home, this is one of the major reasons why people end up giving in and buying young kids smartphones is there&#x27;s these occasional scenarios where we might need to hear from you. These happen all the time. Like I give you some examples. Uh my one son will often take a bus from his school to like where</p>
<p>baseball practice is. And you know sometimes the buses don&#x27;t come or maybe there&#x27;s not actually a baseball practice that day. Um he was at a baseball clinic the other day and I thought I knew how long it run but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure. It&#x27;s 3 hours. I don&#x27;t want to wait there for 3 hours and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure because it was the first time he&#x27;d done it. So I gave him the punk phone to bring with him. He could call me if he&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, we ended early.&quot; Um and we&#x27;d be able to find out what&#x27;s going on. And so it&#x27;s useful for occasions where a kid might need to get in contact with you. Now, the thing about these phones is they&#x27;re like, it&#x27;s a great piece of technology. They&#x27;re not very fun to use. You just have to press these buttons.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very tedious. Uh the main thing you can do with it is we have our numbers programmed in and you can scroll and press a button and call us. You can try to send text messages, but you have to do the T9 where you press the button a bunch of times. It&#x27;s too frustrating, so it gives up. So, they&#x27;re not at all fun. They don&#x27;t care about them. They&#x27;re not happy to have them. It&#x27;s entirely utilitarian. They don&#x27;t own them. We have one. You check it out because you are going to an event. Bring this bring the punct um and then you bring it back when you&#x27;re done and it goes back into our drawer. So that has replaced the</p>
<p>sort of mobile phone functionality you would get from a smartphone. All right. The third piece of technology. This one I love. This is the uh Fio Snow Sky Echo Mini Hi-Fi Bluetooth MP3 Walkman. This is a I believe it&#x27;s a Korean technology. This is an Alibaba website I have up here. It is a MP3 player, Jesse. Uh in the style of like early iPods, the way it works is you have a a memory card</p>
<p>and you just, you know, you it&#x27;s like a disc. You put MP3 files on this card. like you you plug in your computer and you just put MP3 trials on it. You put that card into this player, you can play the MP3 file songs on the file. That&#x27;s it. So, this thing here where you see like a cassette, that&#x27;s actually a display. And so, uh you can see a list of all the songs that are on the memory card and you can scroll through them and you can click on one and it plays that song. That&#x27;s all it does. My middle son really likes music. We had him for a while. There was a there&#x27;s a a device called the Mighty, which is like a small</p>
<p>It was meant to solve this problem of like, oh, I want my kids to listen to music, but they don&#x27;t have a smartphone. But it&#x27;s too high-tech. It It tries to synchronize with Spotify playlist on a smartphone, and it has to continually sort of synchronize with an actual device, and it would often not work. And you would have to we&#x27;d have to be on the phone trying to like make these playlists, and then did it sync? Oh, it didn&#x27;t sink. Maybe it sunk this time. And my son, you know, he&#x27;s going to summer camp this summer for about a month and he wants to be able to listen to music. And with this, the Mighty, if you haven&#x27;t synchronized online with the phone, because of rights issues, every however many days, the list goes away.</p>
<p>Uh, this is much simpler. It&#x27;s just MP3s on a card and you can listen to them. Where do they get the MP3s? Well, they have CDs, so they they my my kids own boom boxes, 1990s style boom boxes, the big tall things, the towers with the CD player and the radio. They listen to the radio and they we buy them CDs and they listen to CDs. We just bought it was like 40 bucks a CDROM reader that you plug in USB to your computer where you can rip MP3s off the CDs just like we used to do in like 2002. So they can put</p>
<p>their CDs in here and rip, which means like make MP3s out of songs from the CDs</p>
<h2>Can we put the social media and video game genies back in their lamp?</h2>
<p>and they drag those on. Also, it turns out that on Amazon you can buy for a lot of albums still unprotected MP3s. Just buy them one by one. Like I want to buy this song for like a$130 and you can still buy the unprotected uh MP3 and just drag them right on this machine. So it&#x27;s great. Interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he wants to listen to music like when on car trips or whatever or in his own room or whatever and this this solves that problem and only that problem. Again, it&#x27;s the type of thing you might otherwise be like, I don&#x27;t know, Apple Music&#x27;s on a phone. They want to listen to music. Let&#x27;s just buy them the</p>
<p>smartphone. But we have a single-purpose piece of technology for that. All right. The fourth uh single-purpose technology we use, and this kind of goes back to one of the issues we talked about in the idea segment, Nintendo Switches, oldfashioned video games. So, it&#x27;s a Nintendo, it has its own screen. We have one that hooks up to the TV and then uh two of the kids have the portable ones and the third has one that can hook up to the TV which allows multiple people like to play on the same screen. If you&#x27;re playing Mario Kart or Minecraft or something like that, you can you can</p>
<p>split up the screen. No online gaming, no playing with other people that they don&#x27;t know. I I I like to buy them the games. You can download games. I like to buy the cartridges. You stick a cartridge in little memory card now and you can play that game. So, it&#x27;s a video game player that only plays non- online video games, and that&#x27;s all it does. They have to be Our rule is these have to be plugged in. We have a charging station in the whatever you call the media console under your TV. They have to be in there. If we find one not in there, you lose the next video game sessions. So, like when you&#x27;re not using it, you have to go and plug it in.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s where it lives. And then we just have well- definfined video game playing sessions. It&#x27;s on the weekends if there&#x27;s a babysitter and if a car ride is beyond a certain amount of time, they have to spend the first 45 minutes, you know, being bored and then they can play video games for what happens or flights if we&#x27;re going on longer flights. So, this is a single-purpose technology which allows them to play fun video games. My son has some crazy fighter jet game where I don&#x27;t understand this game. I thought it was a flight simulator and he keeps coming in and telling me what&#x27;s happening in the game. He&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m in,&quot; this is true story. He came in</p>
<p>and said, &quot;I&#x27;m in jail because I blew up the president.&quot; And I was like, &quot;What type of flight simulator?&quot; It turns out it&#x27;s this like this game that has these like crazy scenarios they put you in. And it&#x27;s And then next time he talked to me, he&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, we have a weapon at this base that was invented to blow up meteors, but we&#x27;re using it to repel a fighter jet or like it&#x27;s just this crazy game, but it&#x27;s like oldfashioned. It&#x27;s a video game that you&#x27;re playing through levels and, you know, oldfashioned video game.&quot; Again, this is another reason why people end up with smartphones like well like also or iPads like I could play games on there as</p>
<p>well. It&#x27;s an easy way I could play the games on the phone, but the single-use technology allows us to control exactly what types of games they play. They&#x27;re not online. We can control when they play them because it&#x27;s a separate device that we can keep at the TV. So again, when you put all this onto a phone, there&#x27;s always some reason why they need that phone. Now they have access to all these things all the time and in ways you can&#x27;t easily control. All right, so here&#x27;s my conclusion. When it comes to technology and kids, single-purpose devices have to be the way to go. It gives you so much more control over their experiences and</p>
<p>allows you to much more confidently steer them away from potential harms, right? It&#x27;s just so clear with single-use technologies. It&#x27;s so much easier to use. The strategy, I think, also makes sense for adults as well. Convenience is not necessarily the most important thing, especially when you&#x27;re talking about like your own entertainment or distraction. And when you put everything on the same phone, it&#x27;s like you have that media cart that I imagine myself having as a kids in the 1990s, like you&#x27;re going to you maybe be trying to make a call, but you&#x27;re going to end up browsing that</p>
<p>porno mag while smoking a cigarette, too, because they&#x27;re right there. So, even for adults, I think moving to single-purpose technology makes sense. You can get that MP3 player if you want to listen to music on long walks, not have a phone that&#x27;s going to come around with you. You can have a simple dumb phone that you bring when you&#x27;re doing stuff where there&#x27;s like these small percentage chances you might need to be contacted in an emergency, but you</p>
<h2>Can an artist avoid using social media?</h2>
<p>otherwise don&#x27;t want this whole distraction machine coming along with you. That could work for an adult as well, right? Don&#x27;t play online video games. Only play AAA games that, you know, you have to be on a a screen and plugged in with a card and there&#x27;s no internet involved. a single-use technology can make as much sense for adults as is for kids. But for kids, I think it&#x27;s a game changer because it allows you to get away or avoid that sort of that path of least resistance approach where it&#x27;s like, well, there&#x27;s some reason why a phone would be useful. And it&#x27;s so easy like on AT&amp;T or Verizon, it&#x27;s like 10 extra</p>
<p>dollars. I click this button, they&#x27;ll just send me a phone and it works. And it&#x27;s so tempting to just do that. But don&#x27;t let them bring that proverbial media cart full of nonsense into their room. It&#x27;s worth taking the time to control the specific technologies they have and how they use each individual one. All right, there we go, Jesse. Single use technologies. &gt;&gt; So, you can still buy CDs, huh? &gt;&gt; You can. Yeah. Uh, we get them on Amazon or Walmart or whatever. It&#x27;s not like every band. It&#x27;s a little bit weird what&#x27;s available and what&#x27;s not, but we got a a lot of like classic 90s music. &gt;&gt; Uh, they still sell those CDs. Yeah. I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know like new bands are putting out CDs, but &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s good. Also, constraints are good. Like you have to track down. You can&#x27;t get all music. You get the music you get. You really &gt;&gt; you really like. All right. Um before we end today, let&#x27;s do uh some questions and comments. &gt;&gt; All right. What&#x27;s our first question here, Jesse? &gt;&gt; First question is from Lisa. Hi, Cal. I&#x27;m a mother of two living in Richmond, Virginia. In conversations with other moms about social media and video games, I&#x27;ve noticed a tone switcher switch over the last couple years from thinking of these platforms as being necessary evils</p>
<p>to thinking of them as evil we should try to avoid. I was wondering if you had advice for us trying to put the social media and video game cats back in the bags. Um, okay. Well, can we do that if you&#x27;ve already given your kid a phone? If you&#x27;ve already given your kid access to like all these video games, is it too late? And there my answer is no. It is perfectly reasonable for an adult parent being a parent to say, &quot;Hey, we let you use this technology. We learn more about it. We</p>
<p>don&#x27;t like it. We don&#x27;t want you to use it anymore.&quot; Some people call that impossible. I call that parenting. Everything you tell a 13-year-old they don&#x27;t like. your whole life is telling them to do things they don&#x27;t want to do. You might as well just add this to the list. What I would do, and I I&#x27;ve recommend this to a lot of parents, is like the I think that the key reform that allows you to reform a lot of other things is to say the number one thing we&#x27;re doing in our household if you have adolescent age kids and they already have phones. The number one rule we&#x27;re changing because we didn&#x27;t realize the dangers,</p>
<p>but now we did. We&#x27;re the parents. We get to say make the rules is you don&#x27;t own your phone. We own the phone. You&#x27;re not paying for that phone. You do not have the right to have that phone everywhere you go. That phone is not your personal property. It is something we lend to you because it&#x27;s useful and for certain entertainment purposes. As a result, here is our rule. When you&#x27;re at home, the phone lives in the kitchen. We have a charger station there. If you need to call someone, you go to the kitchen. If you need to check your text messages, you go to the kitchen. If you need to, man, you hear this all the time</p>
<p>from teenagers. My homework&#x27;s on there, man. I gotta be on my phone for the next six hours because my homework&#x27;s on there. You say, &quot;Show me your homework on the phone. I&#x27;ll sit here with you. We&#x27;ll get it off the phone. The phone lives in the kitchen.&quot; And so that when you&#x27;re at home, it is not a default</p>
<h2>Cal responds to comments</h2>
<p>thing you can bring with you. And that actually will do more good than trying to ban particular just saying like, &quot;Don&#x27;t use this app.&quot; Or the worst, and I really hate this, is the like, &quot;Oh, my son&#x27;s on his phone all the time. I tell him he should stop, but he what could you do?&quot; This is such a better solution. You&#x27;re like, &quot;Do you want to text for six hours?&quot; You&#x27;re going to do it standing in the kitchen and that&#x27;s going to lose its allure and you&#x27;re going to have to do something else. When you&#x27;re at the dinner table, you have to be at the dinner table. The phone&#x27;s not there. When you&#x27;re watching a movie, you have to watch the movie. You don&#x27;t have the option of also checking on your phone. A lot of parents say that&#x27;s impossible.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like somehow it&#x27;s some intrinsic right that was instilled by the UN Commission on Human Rights that 16-year-olds must be able to look at Snapchat while you&#x27;re watching, you know, a show on HBO. That&#x27;s not a law. That&#x27;s not a natural law. That&#x27;s not a rule. It&#x27;s your house. You&#x27;re paying for the phone. So, I think that&#x27;s the number one reform that if your kids already have phones, just say they live in the kitchen. Don&#x27;t argue with people about how much they&#x27;re using or if they should use it less or what apps or it lives in the kitchen. That&#x27;s what I would do. I would also say no online games. I don&#x27;t care if the kids 16, 17, 18. My whole point as a parent</p>
<p>is to prepare you to succeed in the world. Nothing&#x27;s going to get more in the way of that than you learning to play three to four hours of these stupid games every day while exposing yourself to like all the worst things the world has to offer. I do not want my 17-year-old in a Discord server learning how to do groper trolls while playing five hours of god knows what game. That&#x27;s just like I&#x27;m if my kid was like, &quot;Hey, um I&#x27;m going down the liquor store. I&#x27;m gonna hang out on the corner there uh and we&#x27;re going to see if we can rob some old ladies.&quot; Right? like, &quot;No, don&#x27;t go spend four hours doing that.&quot; Also, no, don&#x27;t go on Discord and</p>
<p>play five hours of of Call of Duty. So, yeah, it is fixable. You can go back. And I&#x27;m glad to hear that the tone is changing of the conversation. Um, height had a lot to do with that. I think he gave people permission to be like, &quot;Oh, these things are terrible. We can react to terrible things.&quot; All right, what do we got next? Next up is Marco. I&#x27;m a young artist living in Bilboa, Spain. Surviving as an artist in 2025 has a lot to do with skill of growing social media. My dilemma is that I prefer to spend my time mastering my craft, but I keep getting a sinking feeling that it won&#x27;t matter if my work isn&#x27;t being seen</p>
<p>online. What advice do you have? I think people who are considering social media and professional circumstances are way too general about what they mean and they kind of make it a binary like I need to either be out of business or spend like seven hours a day on TikTok. As if there&#x27;s no in between. It&#x27;s almost like someone saying, &quot;Look, I I I don&#x27;t like that I get blackout drunk every day. Um, but my office is above a bar. What else can I do?&quot; And you like, &quot;Well, just because a bar is there doesn&#x27;t mean you have to go down there and drink all day long, right?&quot; Like</p>
<p>that&#x27;s how I feel sometimes when people are like A people in my field will advertise on social media. B I don&#x27;t want to lose my life to being online on social media all day. These one doesn&#x27;t have to necessarily follow from the other. So</p>
<h2>Cal gives his weekly reading update</h2>
<p>what I would say is you can post things on social media in a way that has very little impact on your life. Do it from your computer. Don&#x27;t have it on your phone. Have a set schedule. It takes like six minutes a day every other day and that&#x27;s it. Do not use the fact that you have some limited need for social media in your life to be an excuse for unlimited use of personal social media for your own distraction and engagement. One does not follow from the other. But here&#x27;s the other thing I would add. Test the assumption of how and why you need to use social media. A lot of people will</p>
<p>just say, &quot;How else will you get noticed?&quot; And I say, &quot;You got to be way more specific to me. What particular activities are you doing on social media? Is it posting images? Is it talking to people in the comments? Is it lurking on Instagram all day? Like, what are the the specific actions you think are driving business? And what are the numbers? How many leads have you gotten off of these Instagram posts? How many uh orders have come in to a link in the bottom of your Tik Tok post? You have to actually quantify specific activities that have specific benefits. And if they are, you can focus on those activities,</p>
<p>cut out the rest, and minimize it. A lot of people, however, are surprised when they do this where they discover it doesn&#x27;t happen. There&#x27;s a a comedian friend of mine told me about this a couple years ago. He was having a hard time with with social media. Uh but he was using it too much and it was really like a source of unhappiness and convinced himself like but I&#x27;m a comedian. Like how else am I going to find opportunities? If I&#x27;m not up to doing jokes, how are people going to find me or whatever? And then he went through a list of the the biggest breaks that he had had in the last few years and realized like every one of those breaks had nothing to do with social media. It had to do with someone seeing</p>
<p>something he created like at a comedy show, seen him do a really good set and be like, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re good. Like, I want to talk to you. We should talk some more.&quot; And it it pushed back on this assumption of like, &quot;This is where all the opportunities are going to come from.&quot; Where that had never actually happened in his life. So, I want you to verify what specific activities on social media you have quantitative evidence are really helping. And if there are some activities that fall in that bucket, focus on those. Do it from a computer, on a schedule, and that should be it. And if you can&#x27;t find any, then you&#x27;re missing out nothing if you uh turn off those apps altogether. We also want to respond to some comments</p>
<p>like we do from time and again. Um I think we have two comments to bring up here from last week&#x27;s episode which I believe was me and Ed Zitron going through the year in AI. So let&#x27;s load this first comment up here on the screen. This comes from uh Mesta 1988 who said not Cal Shading Jensen in the first two minutes. Uh, crying laughing emoji. More shady calendar in 2026. Before I go on with this comment, do you know what that&#x27;s referencing, Jamie or Jesse?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I will show you what that&#x27;s referencing. Boom. Jensen. Uh, it&#x27;s referencing the CEO. I put on the screen for those who are watching. We were making fun of the leather racing jacket worn by the CEO of Nvidia that he always wears. It makes him look like an extra in a Mad Max video. in a talk in which he was talking about the scaling of graphic processing units and AI training. So, we just find that I find that endlessly amusing that he wears that jacket. All right. Then this comment goes on to say, &quot;Cal did a really good job of not letting things go completely off the rails when Zitron</p>
<p>goes on one of his rabid rants.&quot; I love Zitron&#x27;s rants. That&#x27;s what makes them fun. Like he does like Zitron goes on these roles, but that&#x27;s kind of like his thing, right? Um yeah, he it gets over the top and so I I do try to keep derails on. uh he knows what he&#x27;s talking about, but he&#x27;s an entertaining talker because he often gets kind of hyperbolic when he talks about things. But I&#x27;m glad she appreciated that. &gt;&gt; There was a big article about him in Wired a couple months ago. &gt;&gt; I have to read that still. Yeah. Like he really has been doing his research, especially on the financial side. So</p>
<p>like he he often has good points, but then he&#x27;s very funny on his podcast and on radio and interviews and he he goes he&#x27;s really hyperbolic. Um and it often surprises people because they&#x27;ve heard nothing but hype. And so he realized like if he&#x27;s just like super strong like that&#x27;s nonsense and here&#x27;s why he&#x27;s like really strong it it it really lands. All right. Here&#x27;s &gt;&gt; definitely controversial. &gt;&gt; He is controversial. All right. I like him though. All right. Here&#x27;s another comment. Um well because dialectical to say this, right? I think it&#x27;s nice to like slam ideas together. You get bit deeper insight. &gt;&gt; This next comment is from Shrea Doss</p>
<p>5065. I can&#x27;t believe that the American professor is so polite and the British journalist is not. Indeed, our world is changing. On a serious note, thanks a lot for this discussion. Absolutely stunning. It is funny. I know like I I the British person should be like the super polite. Uh but you know what? It&#x27;s not really true. Here&#x27;s been my experience with British academics in in particular is they&#x27;re not bombastic, but they&#x27;re very cudding. Like they just have like Americans kind of wear their heart on their sleeves. They&#x27;re like, &quot;That&#x27;s stupid. I don&#x27;t like that. You&#x27;re stupid because you said that and you&#x27;re a dumbhead. I don&#x27;t want to talk</p>
<p>to you.&quot; Um and the British person will just have like a perfect like bono. just have like this like uh super cutting like hm I see. Yeah, that is the type of thing that a Dartmouth man would say and they just kind of puff on their pipe a little bit and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Wait a second, he just really burned me there.&quot; So, they&#x27;re not as polite as people think. All right. Uh, thanks for the questions and the comments. Uh, I want to conclude as always by talking about what I&#x27;m reading. U, so a quick update. At the end of last episode, I was talking about the the</p>
<p>thrillers I read in December. Uh I forgot, however, the name of the fifth book I read in December. So, just for the completist out there, um the fifth book I read in December was called 20th Century Fox by Scott Iman. And it was a a history of the 20th Century Fox film studio. Interesting. The name, Jesse, I didn&#x27;t realize this. It was a merger in the early days of cinema of Fox Studios created by William Fox and 20th Century Studios created by someone else. And when they came together, that&#x27;s why it was called 20th Century Fox. So, I hadn&#x27;t realized that. That was a good</p>
<p>book. I mean, the thing is I didn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know most of the movie references. So, it&#x27;s like, oh, you know, and this became like Betty Greybel in, you know, the the Golden Stage Coach and as if like you&#x27;re supposed to know the reference. I don&#x27;t really know the old movie references. Uh, but it was really like the story of mainly like Daryl Xanic and the the the rise of cinema and the trouble they had and how they came back and I found it was interesting. All right. What did I read more recently? So last week between last episode and this episode I read Jane Goodall&#x27;s book in the shadow of man which uh early in her career I think she</p>
<p>published this in the late 60s early7s was sort of her first account of her time in the the GB stream chimpanzeee reservation um about her her first work with chimpanzees. So it was a big bestseller at the time because people didn&#x27;t know anything about chimps and she wrote this book about her experience spending all this time with them. Um I liked it. It&#x27;s a lot less sciency than these type of books are today, Jesse. So, if you read one of these like scientist memoirs today where they talk about like the work they were working on with like a memoir aspect to it, there&#x27;s a lot more theory in it. So, like if you</p>
<p>wrote this book today, there&#x27;d probably be a lot more of what are the particular theories about animal behavior that they were finding and oh, we were we we got this evidence of this and that. It was a lot more of just her describing and then this happened, we saw this, we saw them doing this and that. It was like just very descriptive of like what chimpanzees were like because I think it was so early. That itself was interesting. I like that book. And then I read a um a museum exhibit companion book on an exhibit about Walt Disney and trains because I had a section in the book I&#x27;m writing now about Walt Disney&#x27;s personal train set he built at his</p>
<p>house. And so there was a big exhibit about this out in LA and I there&#x27;s a companion book that has a lot of details and images. And so I read that as well last week. So there you go. All right, that&#x27;s all the time we have for this week. Thanks for listening. We&#x27;ll be back next week. I have a special guest joining me to help me in the idea segment. So, it should be fun. So, hopefully I will see you will hear from you then. And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, if you like today&#x27;s discussion of new dangers to be worried about, you might also like episode 374, which looked at the original danger, phones. That episode is titled This is Your Brain on Phones. It gives you a</p>
<p>closer look at what&#x27;s actually happening inside your brain as you use those devices. Check it out. I think you&#x27;ll like it. For some people, the constant allure of their phone is so strong, it&#x27;s so inescapable that it can seem impossible to find any sort of freedom. This is what I want to talk about</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Can’t Stop Scrolling? This Old Strategy Can Tame New Technology | Cal Newport</title>

<h2>It&#x27;s the 1990s</h2>
<p>I want you to consider a thought experiment. Imagine that it&#x27;s the 1990s. This is when Jesse and I were growing up, when we were kids. Uh, and that one day I walked into my house wheeling like a media cart. And on this cart, I had a television connected to a Sega Genesis. And on one side was a pouch that contained cigarettes. On the other side was a pouch containing a lot of pornographic magazines. And there was a radio next to it that was blaring like AM political talk radio. And on top of the TV was a phone. And I&#x27;m wandering by pushing this media cart. Um, as I head to my room in this thought experiment, my mom correctly stops me and says,</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell do you think you&#x27;re doing with all that?&quot; And then I answer calmly, &quot;Mom, there&#x27;s a phone on here. Do you not want me to be able to talk to my friends?&quot; Seen in that context, the situation would be ridiculous. But isn&#x27;t this exactly what&#x27;s happening today when we let an 11-year-old have a smartphone and all of the types of harms and negative externalities that introduces just because there&#x27;s like one or two single features on there that we&#x27;ve convinced ourselves or they&#x27;ve convinced us is somehow useful. Um, I want to play an audio. This is a clip I played before.</p>
<p>This is from uh Smartphone Free Childhood. It&#x27;s a PSA they did. But I want to play a quick clip here that makes that same point about my ridiculous experiment about the media cart is exactly what we&#x27;re doing when we give a kid a smartphone. Let&#x27;s hear the audio. This is a dad checking in on uh his elementary school age kid at bedtime. &gt;&gt; Hey kiddo, it&#x27;s about time for bed. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Well, remember there&#x27;s a box in the corner over there with all the pornographic material that&#x27;s ever been made in the world. Even the really weird</p>
<p>stuff that could scar you for life. I&#x27;m trusting you not to look in there. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Feelings are for losers. &gt;&gt; Oh, and this guy&#x27;s going to be in your corner all night just randomly spewing out hateful things. Just [snorts] ignore them. Okay. While I&#x27;m thinking of it, there&#x27;s an order form on your desk where you can purchase illegal drugs. The mean girls from your school are going to be standing there talking about you all night. And this Russian hacker is going to keep asking for your password. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not hacker. Amazon customer service. &gt;&gt; Just need you to ignore them. Okay. &gt;&gt; Love you, buddy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We ask too much of our kids when we give them a smartphone. Let&#x27;s change the norm together. &gt;&gt; Maybe we go around the &gt;&gt; All right. This is making the point I was just saying, which is like it&#x27;s pretty crazy the way that we turn a blind eye to all of the terribleness on these devices because there&#x27;s some reason, well, but my kid needs to tell me when his play practice is over. Like one reason we let them use all this stuff. We&#x27;re basically letting in my scenario me with my media cart full of all that stuff go into my room and bring that all with me. Now, in the 1990s, this would have been ridiculous. Um, but</p>
<p>we also had an easy solution to the problem because all of these different bad technologies in my 1990s example were single use which made them easy to control or curate. So, in my scenario, if I had that media cart full of all that stuff, my mom would have like, &quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.&quot; Okay, here&#x27;s what you can do. You can have the phone because I want you to be able to talk to your friends. No, you can&#x27;t have a TV in your room. Uh, we&#x27;ll have a TV out in the living room, and that&#x27;s where the video games are, and you can only play those video games during times where we say you can play the video games, and you</p>
<p>can&#x27;t have cigarettes, and you can&#x27;t have the porno magazines, and I don&#x27;t want you listening to the Rush Limba on the AM radio. Because everything is a separate technology, it is very easy to control and curate. In an age when all that&#x27;s pushed together into one device like a smartphone, things can seem kind of hopeless. So, can all we do is look back nostalgically at the &#x27;9s and say, &quot;Man, those were easier times.&quot; Not necessarily. All right. All right. So, in my own family, my wife and I have increasingly been seeking out modern singlepurpose</p>
<h2>Modern single purpose tools</h2>
<p>tools to replace specific functions that you might otherwise have been delivered through a smartphone. This is allowing us to help support our rule of no smartphones until high school by being able to use and deploy single-purpose technologies for specific things we think would be useful or enjoyable to our kids without having to give them the device that had everything else on it as well. So, here&#x27;s what I want to do in this practices segment today. Um, I want to talk about four different singleuse technologies, singlepurpose technologies that my wife and I actually have deployed with our kids in our life as</p>
<p>part of our strategy to not have to give them a Swiss Army knife style uh smartphone. All right. The first single-use technology, and this one we just got, and I&#x27;ll load this on the screen here for people who are watching, so just listening, is a 10 phone. A tin can phone is uh it&#x27;s a landline basically. It uses the internet but it is you can see this on the screen. Um it is an actual phone with a cord and it plugs into the wall and the receiver is connected to the base and when you pick it up there&#x27;s numbers on it and you can you know dial</p>
<p>numbers. They even have one that looks like an oldfashioned phone like from the &#x27;9s and that one uh is actually sold out. So, we now have this in our house for our kids to call or receive call from friends. Like my 13-year-old can like call one of his friends by dialing the number or they can call their cousins or they can call their grandparents if they want to talk to them. They can also receive calls on it. Yeah, you control everything through the app. So, you can say what numbers you&#x27;re allowed to come in. Also important, if my wife and I are out of the house, if we&#x27;re going for a walk or something like that and someone&#x27;s at home, they can call us from the home. If they have a</p>
<p>question or an issue, you can also call 911 from it. It&#x27;s what we used to have. Just a landline. It just uses the internet instead of copper wires, but it&#x27;s just like a landline like we used to have. A couple things I&#x27;ve noticed, Jesse, now that we&#x27;ve deployed the tin can phone. One, kids these days aren&#x27;t used to dialing phone numbers, right? Because it&#x27;s a lot of digits, right? Like we got kind of used to it. You have like the the the area code and then the exchange and D. They really struggle. They&#x27;re like, &quot;Wait, another number? Another number?&quot; they kind of lose their</p>
<p>train of thought. Like, they&#x27;ll have to dial a number a lot of times. Another thing I noticed, which I thought was interesting, is my my 13-year-old didn&#x27;t know how to use a wired phone handset. So, he called his friend and he was holding it like a speaker phone. He&#x27;s like, I can&#x27;t hear him. Cuz he didn&#x27;t know about like holding uh a phone, you know? It&#x27;s like, no, you got to hold it up like to your face. And then when he tried to do that, he hung up using his ear. So, he pushed it up against his face and hung up. So, they&#x27;re like they&#x27;re not used to using landlines. say we we take that for granted. Um, but they love having it and now they can have contact. We told our oldest son, by</p>
<p>the way, if he ends up using it a lot, we&#x27;re open to putting one in his room so he can have more private conversations with his friends and we can turn it off with an app and say, &quot;Yeah, but at like bedtime, it just shuts off.&quot; All right. Um, that is uh that&#x27;s how we use it. We use it for if you had a smartphone, you would make calls on the smartphone. Now, we use this landline instead. It&#x27;s a singlepurpose technology. One thing it can&#x27;t do is text. Uh the solution for the singlepurpose technology solution for texting in my opinion is to get an old iPad, like a refurbished iPad that&#x27;s</p>
<p>plugged in in your kitchen that you have an iMessage account logged into. And if you have a kid who wants to be a part of group uh chats, they can in the kitchen sit there on the iPad and check in on the chats and and and and add to it. They can&#x27;t have it in their own room. They have to be in the kitchen to do it. and they have to be subject to you could walk by and see what they&#x27;re chatting, right? Especially if they&#x27;re younger. That threat of like you don&#x27;t have complete privacy on here because God knows what you&#x27;re going to do. Helps sort of keep things more reasonable. My son, like a lot of boys like don&#x27;t care too much about it. They</p>
<p>do have some text chat uh threads. He he doesn&#x27;t care enough for us to set this up because he it&#x27;s mainly just dumbness. Girls his age, from what I understand, are doing much more sort of sophisticated sort of social coordination on there. But that would be the solution I would give is here&#x27;s the the the group chat machine just like next to the telephone is the group chat iPad next to it in the kitchen. All right. So let me load up here the second single purpose technology we use. We have a punct pu n kt. I have this loaded up on the screen. So as you can see Jesse it is a old school cellular phone</p>
<h2>Punkt phone</h2>
<p>that only has numbers. You actually press the physical buttons one through nine. You have like a call and a hang up button and like a volume up and down button. What do we use our punked phone for? This is our single-use technology. If one of our kids is going somewhere where they might need to contact us when away from the home, this is one of the major reasons why people end up giving in and buying young kids smartphones is there&#x27;s these occasional scenarios where we might need to hear from you. These happen all the time. Like I give you some examples. Uh my one son will often</p>
<p>take a bus from his school to like where baseball practice is. And you know sometimes the buses don&#x27;t come or maybe there&#x27;s not actually a baseball practice that day. Um he was at a baseball clinic the other day and I thought I knew how long it run but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure. It&#x27;s 3 hours. I don&#x27;t want to wait there for 3 hours and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure because it was the first time he&#x27;d done it. So I gave him the punk phone to bring with him. He could call me if he&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, we ended early.&quot; Um and we&#x27;d be able to find out what&#x27;s going on. And so it&#x27;s useful for occasions where a kid might need to get in contact with you. Now, the thing about these phones is they&#x27;re like, it&#x27;s a great piece of</p>
<p>technology. They&#x27;re not very fun to use. You just have to press these buttons. It&#x27;s very tedious. Uh the main thing you can do with it is we have our numbers programmed in and you can scroll and press a button and call us. You can try to send text messages, but you have to do the T9 where you press the button a bunch of times. It&#x27;s too frustrating, so it gives up. So, they&#x27;re not at all fun. They don&#x27;t care about them. They&#x27;re not happy to have them. It&#x27;s entirely utilitarian. They don&#x27;t own them. We have one. You check it out because you are going to an event. Bring the punct um and then you bring it back when</p>
<p>you&#x27;re done and it goes back into our drawer. So that has replaced the sort of mobile phone functionality you would get from a smartphone. All right. The third piece of technology. This one I love. This is the uh Fio Snow Sky Echo Mini Hi-Fi Bluetooth MP3 Walkman. This is a I believe it&#x27;s a Korean technology. This is an Alibaba website I have up here. It is a MP3 player, Jesse. Uh in the style of like early iPods, the</p>
<p>way it works is you have a a memory card and you just, you know, you it&#x27;s like a disc. You put MP3 files on this card. like you you plug in your computer and you just put MP3 trials on it. You put that card into this player, you can play the MP3 f songs on the file. That&#x27;s it. So, this thing here where you see like a cassette, that&#x27;s actually a display. And so, uh you can see a list of all the songs that are on the memory card and you can scroll through them and you can click on one and it plays that song. That&#x27;s all it does. My middle son really likes music. We had him for a while.</p>
<p>There was a there&#x27;s a a device called the Mighty, which is like a small It was meant to solve this problem of like, oh, I want my kids to listen to music, but they don&#x27;t have a smartphone. But it&#x27;s too high-tech. It It tries to synchronize with Spotify playlist on a smartphone, and it has to continually sort of synchronize with an actual device, and it would often not work. And you would have to we&#x27;d have to be on the phone trying to like make these playlists, and then did it sync? Oh, it didn&#x27;t sink. Maybe it sunk this time. And my son, you know, he&#x27;s going to summer camp this summer for about a month. and he wants to be able to listen to music. And with this, the Mighty, if</p>
<p>you haven&#x27;t synchronized online with the phone, because of rights issues, every however many days, the list goes away. Uh, this is much simpler. It&#x27;s just MP3s on a card, and you can listen to them. Where do they get the MP3s? Well, they have CDs, so they they my my kids own boom boxes, 1990s style boom boxes, the big tall things, the towers with the CD player and the radio. They listen to the radio and they we buy them CDs and they listen to CDs. We just bought it was like 40 bucks a CDROM reader that you plug in USB to your computer where you</p>
<p>can rip MP3s off the CDs just like we used to do in like 2002. So they can put their CDs in here and rip which means like make MP3s out of songs from the CDs and they drag those on. Also, it turns out that on Amazon you can buy for a lot of albums still unprotected MP3s. Just buy them one by one. like I want to buy this song for like a $130 and you can still buy the unprotected uh MP3 and just drag him right on this machine. So, it&#x27;s great. Interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, he wants to listen to music like when on car trips or whatever or in his own room or whatever and this this solves that problem and only that</p>
<p>problem. Again, it&#x27;s the type of thing you might otherwise be like, I don&#x27;t know, Apple Music&#x27;s on a phone, they want to listen to music. Let&#x27;s just buy them the smartphone. But we have a single purpose piece of technology for that. All right. The fourth uh single-purpose technology we use, and this kind of goes back to one of the issues we talked about in the idea segment, Nintendo Switches, old-fashioned video games. So, it&#x27;s a</p>
<h2>Nintendo Switch</h2>
<p>Nintendo, it has its own screen. We have one that hooks up to the TV and then uh two of the kids have the portable ones and the third has one that can hook up to the TV, which allows multiple people like to play on the same screen. If you&#x27;re playing Mario Kart or Minecraft or something like that, you can you can split up the screen. No online gaming, no playing with other people that they don&#x27;t know. I I I like to buy them the games. You can download games. I like to buy the cartridges. You stick a cartridge in, little memory card now, and you can play that game. So, it&#x27;s a video game player that only plays</p>
<p>non-line video games, and that&#x27;s all it does. They have to be Our rule is these have to be plugged in. We have a charging station and the whatever you call the media console under your TV. They have to be in there. If we find one not in there, you lose the next video game sessions. So like when you&#x27;re not using it, you have to go and plug it in. That&#x27;s where it lives. And then we just have well- definfined video game playing sessions. It&#x27;s on the weekends. If there&#x27;s a babysitter and if a car ride is beyond a certain amount of time, they have to spend the first 45 minutes, you know, being bored and then they can play video games for what happens or flights</p>
<p>if we&#x27;re going on longer flights. So, this is a single-purpose technology which allows them to play fun video games. My son has some crazy fighter jet game where I don&#x27;t understand this game. I thought it was a flight simulator and he keeps coming in and telling me what&#x27;s happening in the game. He&#x27;s like, well, I&#x27;m in, this is true story. He came in and said, &quot;I&#x27;m in jail because I blew up the president.&quot; [laughter] And I was like, &quot;What type of flight simulator?&quot; Turns out it&#x27;s this like this game that has these like crazy scenarios they put you in. And that son and the next time he talked to me, he&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, we have a weapon at this base that was</p>
<p>invented to blow up meteors, but we&#x27;re using it to repel a fighter jet or like it&#x27;s just this crazy game, but it&#x27;s like oldfashioned. It&#x27;s a video game that you&#x27;re playing through levels and you know, oldfashioned video game.&quot; Again, this is another reason why people end up with smartphones like well like also or iPads like I could play games on there as well. It&#x27;s an easy way. I can play the games on the phone, but the single-use technology allows us to control exactly what types of games they play. They&#x27;re not online. We can control when they play them because it&#x27;s a separate device that we can keep at the TV. So again, when you put all this onto a phone, there&#x27;s always some reason why</p>
<p>they need that phone. Now, they have access to all these things all the time and in ways you can&#x27;t easily control. All right, so here&#x27;s my conclusion. When it comes to technology and kids, single-use devices have to be the way to go. It gives you so much more control over their experiences and allows you to much more confidently steer them away from potential harms, right? It&#x27;s just so clear with single-use technologies. It&#x27;s so much easier to use. The strategy, I think, also makes sense for adults as well. Convenience is not necessarily the most</p>
<p>important thing, especially when you&#x27;re talking about like your own entertainment or distraction. And when you put everything on the same phone, it&#x27;s like you have that media cart that I imagined myself having as a kids in the 1990s. Like you&#x27;re going to you maybe be trying to make a call, but you&#x27;re going to end up browsing that porno mag while smoking a cigarette, too, because they&#x27;re right there. So even for adults, I think moving to single purpose technology makes sense. You can get that MP3 player if you want to listen to music on long walks, not have a phone that&#x27;s going to come around with you. You can have a simple dumb phone that you bring when you&#x27;re doing stuff where there&#x27;s like these small</p>
<p>percentage chances you might need to be contacted in an emergency, but you otherwise don&#x27;t want this whole distraction machine coming along with you. That could work for an adult as well, right? Don&#x27;t play online video games. Only play AAA games that you know you have to be on a a screen and plugged in with a card and there&#x27;s no internet involved. a single-use technology can make as much sense for adults as is for kids. But for kids, I think it&#x27;s a game changer because it allows you to get away or avoid that sort of that path of least resistance approach where it&#x27;s like, well, there&#x27;s some reason why a phone would be useful. And it&#x27;s so easy like</p>
<p>on AT&amp;T or Verizon, it&#x27;s like 10 extra dollars. I click this button, they&#x27;ll just send me a phone and it works. And it&#x27;s so tempting to just do that. But don&#x27;t let them bring that proverbial media cart full of nonsense into their room. It&#x27;s worth taking the time to control the specific technologies they have and how they use each individual one. Hey, if you like this video, I think you&#x27;ll really like this one as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Ambition</h2>
<p>Let&#x27;s talk about ambition. We all have an instinct to want to accomplish things that are hard and impressive. This is something that comes from our paleolithic genes. Impress your tribe so that you&#x27;ll get more opportunities for food and for mates. But regardless of the source, this impulse is strong and if you can integrate it into your life, you are going to feel more satisfied. So here&#x27;s a question I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot lately. What&#x27;s the impact of the internet on our ambition instinct? Now, there are two possible stories to</p>
<p>be told in answering this question. The first story is positive. The best way to support your ambition is to surround yourself by people with a similar vision. And the internet makes it possible to find and create virtual tribes centered on whatever it is you care about. Like, let&#x27;s do an example here. Let&#x27;s say like you&#x27;re a you&#x27;re a young man who uh aspires to be a serious reader. 30 years ago, you might be living in a small town and not know a single other guy who reads beyond the occasional Gisham or Clancy novel. But now, you could, for example, uh, listen to a podcast like Old School, which is</p>
<p>hosted by Shiloh Brooks, and each week features well-known men discussing books that changed their lives. Like, look, I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll bring this up on the screen here for people who are watching. Uh, look at these conversations. Uh, America&#x27;s Most Righteous War produces best anti-war novel. Why middlem Mars changed his Catholic priest life. Read this book instead of catcher in the ride. George Orwell&#x27;s lessons on the class divide and so on. Right? This would now make it possible for you to actually surround yourself with people who care about reading. That&#x27;s pretty amazing. But there&#x27;s a second story about the internet and ambition that</p>
<p>there are whole corners of the internet that play on your instinct for ambition but lead you to weird or unhealthy or extreme places. Like, let me load up another example here on the screen. This is Brian Johnson. This is an Instagram post. All right. So, it says here, &quot;Brian Johnson spends $2 million plus per year on health optimization, tracking every detail, taking 100 plus supplements daily, and following an ultra strict routine to slow aging.&quot; Uh that&#x27;s the type of I&#x27;m going to put air</p>
<p>quotes around this guidance that maybe makes you feel productive in the moment like you&#x27;re crushing it maybe for a little while but ultimately you&#x27;re really going to waste a lot of time and money. This then is what I&#x27;m worried about. Is the internet hijacking our ambition and aiming us towards nonsense. And if that&#x27;s the case, how do we avoid that trap? This is the question I want to investigate in the idea segment of today&#x27;s show. And to help me with this quest, I&#x27;m going to bring in a ringer, my longtime friend and longtime friend of the show, Brad Stolberg. He&#x27;s going to join us here in a second that makes sense of all of this. Um, I invited Brad</p>
<p>because he has a new book out. It comes out this week and it&#x27;s called The Way of Excellence: A Guide to True Greatness and Deep Satisfaction in a Chaotic World. Uh, Steve Kerr blurbed this book and said, quote, &quot;It&#x27;s an absolutely beautiful book.&quot; End quote. Um, I also blurred this book and called it a must readad. Jesse, I don&#x27;t want to brag, but between the two of us, Steve Kerr and I have won nine NBA championships. So, you know, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been doing, but we&#x27;ve been we&#x27;ve been racking up rings, buddy. Um, anyways, uh, who who better to help me untangle online</p>
<p>hustle, culture, ambition, and the search for true greatness than someone who really just wrote a book about what&#x27;s really entailed in authentic excellence. All right. Um, then in our practice segments, we&#x27;re going to switch gears. A lot of you have been asking for some ideas about how to reinvigorate your efforts to work deeply in our increasingly distracted world. We haven&#x27;t talked work about work recently. So, I&#x27;m going to revisit some of my absolute favorite topics, in particular, email. I have some new ideas to share for how to tame your inbox in 2026. All right, so I&#x27;m excited for all of this. As always, I&#x27;m Cal Newport and this is</p>
<p>Deep Questions, the show about the fight for depth in an increasingly distracted world. and we&#x27;ll get started right after the music. &gt;&gt; Hey Brad, welcome back to the show. &gt;&gt; Cal, it&#x27;s always great to be back.</p>
<h2>Is the internet hijacking ambition?</h2>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, I thought a good place to start if we want to understand what the internet is doing to our ambition is this idea that comes from both your book, but your writing and talking more generally about pseudo excellence. Why don&#x27;t you like bring us up to speed on what you mean by that and then we&#x27;ll deploy it to help understand our issue here? &gt;&gt; I think about pseudo excellence as individuals who are more concerned with the performance of greatness than the actual habits, mindsets, and practices that are required to be great. So, these are the people that wake up at</p>
<p>a.m., do seven cold plunges, take 39 supplements, eat a restrictive diet, have extremely intricate morning routines. And they are purveying all these things as if it&#x27;s necessary to be excellent, if it&#x27;s necessary to be great, which one it&#x27;s not. And two, there&#x27;s a difference between being the world champion of having the most elaborate morning routine and being the best you can be in an actual craft or pursuit or activity that you care about. And too often those things get confused. Pseudo excellence is more about the elaborate dance. Actual excellence is</p>
<p>about caring deeply and doing the thing that matters to you. So you&#x27;re saying result matters in the sense of if you&#x27;re not really aiming towards a particular direction that&#x27;s meaningful you&#x27;re just doing the steps without any particular place you&#x27;re aiming that throws you more I mean is it the case that these people who talk about their 100 supplements what are they even trying to do I guess let&#x27;s be clear about it &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s the first question and I think a lot of them the answer is they&#x27;re trying to make money by grabbing your attention on the internet and they&#x27;re quite good at that uh but they&#x27;re not trying to be a great</p>
<p>athlete. They&#x27;re not trying to be a phenomenal researcher or physician or knowledge worker because the individuals that are trying to actually master and develop competence and skill at a pursuit. They don&#x27;t have time for the 47step routine because they&#x27;re focused on keeping the main things the main things and nailing the fundamentals of their craft over and over and over again. And what happens is people get caught up in this internet ambition, this pseudo excellence, and it just drives them from one cycle to the next, from one fad to the next, and they never really make progress because often times</p>
<p>they don&#x27;t really know where they&#x27;re trying to go. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s an appeal to just being focused on the performance, I would assume, because it&#x27;s a goal you can succeed with, right? So, I can do a 50step morning routine. I&#x27;m not going to there&#x27;s no one who&#x27;s going to tell me I&#x27;m not good enough. there&#x27;s no bar, I&#x27;m going to fail. So, it seems safer somehow. Then I might not actually win the race I&#x27;m preparing for. My book might not actually get published. There&#x27;s a sort of uh safety in the sort of checklist productivity of like if I&#x27;m I&#x27;m doing things I know I can do these things and I&#x27;m just going to get reward</p>
<p>by doing a large quantity of them. That&#x27;s 100% right. And I think that oftentimes what happens is when individuals feel insecurity, which we all feel insecurity, it&#x27;s the human condition to feel insecure, is sometimes we lean on these super elaborate processes. Uh because they give us a sense of control in an inherently uncertain uncontrollable world. Uh but again like we have to ask are we just running around exerting energy for the sake of running around and exerting energy or are these things actually working towards our values and goals in developing skill and competence and</p>
<p>mastery. Um generally speaking the individuals who are the best at what they do uh they have relatively simple and mundane approaches. They&#x27;re just relentlessly consistent and they stick to those simple and mundane approaches over the long haul. I&#x27;m going to put on my Mel Robbins hat here for a second and say, Brad, you just made me think about something that blew me away. That&#x27;s my male impression here. But I I want to I just had an idea I hadn&#x27;t had before. I want to run by you. An example of something in my own life that now I&#x27;m realizing, oh, maybe this is a pseudo excellence uh performance and action.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m always hearing from people in the world of ideas like writers, aspiring writers, who build these incredibly elaborate idea capture and management systems where they have all sorts of custom setups where it will make automatic connections and use AI and will show you new ideas that you didn&#x27;t even know existed for books. And there&#x27;s there&#x27;s uh notion and zapier and chatbt APIs, these really complex systems. And I&#x27;ve always said, look, I know I&#x27;m a professional idea guy. I know professional idea people. You&#x27;re a professional idea person. The way we</p>
<p>deal with ideas is not technically speaking that interesting. I mean, we read and think a lot and the stuff that&#x27;s good sticks with us and we end up writing something about it. We don&#x27;t need really complicated systems. Is that complicated sort of idea management systems? Is this just another example of uh pseudo excellence instead of excellence? &gt;&gt; I think it depends. It certainly can be. If you&#x27;re spending more time and energy thinking about your idea system than actually executing on the good ideas, then absolutely uh many of the best idea people that I&#x27;ve been around that I reported on for this book, whether they</p>
<p>are intellects, whether they are writers, but also physicians, entrepreneurs, business people, um they all tell me some version of the same thing, which is their idea capture system is a pen in a notebook. It&#x27;s pretty low tech. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I&#x27;ve always had that sense that it&#x27;s when an idea won&#x27;t go away, that&#x27;s what matters. That&#x27;s the signal. In fact, you don&#x27;t even want to write it down because the point is if you can&#x27;t forget it, then that probably means something good. All right, so let&#x27;s try this. I want to load up a couple examples here and we&#x27;ll do a little bit of analysis of are these pseudo excellence, who are these people, what&#x27;s</p>
<p>going on. I really want to understand better, not abstractly, but concretely, what&#x27;s actually happening on the internet. So, I&#x27;m going to click on something here. Here, I&#x27;m going to share it uh jointly on our screen. All right. And here we go. I&#x27;m going to play this. &gt;&gt; My day is a.m. to noon. And I&#x27;m not crazy. You&#x27;re crazy for thinking it takes 24 hours, just like some dude in the cave did 300 years ago. My second day starts at noon and goes till p.m. That&#x27;s day 2. And then the next day is p.m. to midnight. What I&#x27;ve done now is I have changed the manipulated time. I now get 21 days a week.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Well, there we go. Um, what is going on there? I mean, that&#x27;s a muscular man. Is he spending all three of his 21 days a week lifting weights? Like what&#x27;s going what how do you read this video, Brad? &gt;&gt; I read this video as um very very insane. So what he&#x27;s essentially saying is he works an 18-hour day and he works an 18-hour day 7 days a week. And for the vast vast vast vast majority of people that is impossible. That&#x27;s a fool&#x27;s errand. That&#x27;s going to lead to a degragation in quality of work and also a degragation in your longevity because</p>
<p>you are going to burn out. The reason I say the vast majority of people &gt;&gt; What does he do? What does he do for those 18 hours a day? I don&#x27;t actually know who this is. What would you imagine he&#x27;s not like running a hedge fund? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s working 18 hours a day. I think it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s BS. I think that it it&#x27;s just like this hustle culture where people want to feel super motivated and inspired uh to go crush it. But I don&#x27;t think that guy&#x27;s working 18 hours a day. Um and I think that that&#x27;s part of the problem. like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s nonsense. Uh and if he is working 18 hours a day, then he&#x27;s he&#x27;s working on building an online platform 18 hours a day, which sounds like a a really um I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know, for me at least, that would not be a very fulfilling way to spend my 21 days a week. &gt;&gt; Uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that is probably right. Okay. Because some people look, if you&#x27;re a James Cameron or the six months that you&#x27;re filming Avatar, &gt;&gt; you work 18 hours. That&#x27;s just how that works. Because &gt;&gt; even then, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s working an 18 hour day. I think he&#x27;s probably working a little bit less. And the reason I said the vast majority, like the exceptions that I think of, um, if you&#x27;re a soldier that&#x27;s deployed at war, you&#x27;re going to probably have stretches of 18 hour days. Uh, if you&#x27;re a trauma physician and there&#x27;s a natural disaster in in your locality, you&#x27;re going to</p>
<p>have 18 hour days. But this notion that you should voluntarily set yourself up to work an 18-hour day. Like, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pseudo excellence. Uh, none of the best founders that I know are constantly working 18our days. None of the best athletes, you know, this guy&#x27;s muscular. like actual powerlifters, they&#x27;re not training 18 hours a day. Um they&#x27;re they&#x27;re very very periodized in their approaches. When they&#x27;re on, they&#x27;re on and when they&#x27;re off, they&#x27;re off. Uh rest and renewal is a part of excellence, and you need more than six hours of rest and renewal a day, and it&#x27;s very hard to work seven days a</p>
<p>week. &gt;&gt; All right, let&#x27;s see. Uh let me load up another example here. All right, now this one, I think you might just say, &quot;Actually, this is very reasonable, and there&#x27;s a lot we could learn from this gentleman.&quot; All right. People are listening. It says a.m. He&#x27;s brushing his teeth shirtless. Now he&#x27;s drinking water at a.m. He&#x27;s a.m. He goes outside to do push-ups. a.m. I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing. He&#x27;s flexing. a.m. He&#x27;s meditating. a.m. He&#x27;s writing in a journal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; BE SERIOUS ABOUT THE LORD. &gt;&gt; a.m. He&#x27;s listening to religious radio. Man, it&#x27;s only a.m. and he&#x27;s already done more things than I do. um in a typical day. I will say this about him though. Uh like him, I do most of my day shirtless flexing because I think I find that&#x27;s another very strong gentleman. Uh all right, so what&#x27;s going on with this? This guy woke up at 3 and has been doing nonwork-related stuff for two hours so far in this video. &gt;&gt; I would ask uh what&#x27;s the point of all</p>
<p>this? And if it takes you a two-hour routine to feel primed and ready to go, honestly, I&#x27;d say that you&#x27;re quite fragile. Uh because then you become reliant on this super elaborate, complex routine just to get activated and you&#x27;re wasting all this time and energy getting ready to perform at what you actually care about versus showing up and performing at what you actually care about. Uh another misnomer around excellence is that all the greats have these super complex routines. They actually don&#x27;t. What you find is that influencers on the internet have super complex routines and people who are</p>
<p>actually great at what they do tend to have very simple and compact routines. It&#x27;s often I wake up, I make a cup of coffee and I journal for 5 minutes or I wake up and I meditate for 10 minutes or I wake up and I hit the snooze button on my alarm and then it rings again and I wake up and I drag myself out of sleep and I go on a little walk. Um, those are the the actual routines of the CEOs of companies that I&#x27;ve reported on, of the Olympians, uh, the Grammyinning artist, so on and so forth. Again, this comes up, I sound like a broken record. We</p>
<p>want to separate being great. It&#x27;s something that matters to you and aligns with your values and goals versus being the world champion of motivation or having this kind of elaborate routine. Those are very different things. &gt;&gt; I mean, I think people, they used to ask me a lot these sort of morning routine type interviews or blogs or whatever. They stopped asking me I think because my answer is so boring. It&#x27;s well I I kind of scramble to get my kids ready for school and then we walk them to the bus stop and then after I get my kids to the bus stop I work. That was the morning routine is like I get my kids fed and we go to school and then you</p>
<p>know it&#x27;s like 8 something and I start working. It&#x27;s just not that exciting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And as a result, you get those extra hour or two hours of sleep, which uh you know, study after study would say that that&#x27;s much more important for your performance than anything you&#x27;re going to be doing between 4 and 6 a.m. &gt;&gt; What is the role of muscles in this? Right. So, we&#x27;ve seen two examples so far where the the gentlemen involved are very muscular. Um, is this some notion of like I&#x27;m wondering if what&#x27;s going on here is that especially if you&#x27;re like a young male watcher of these videos. The thing that&#x27;s actually hijacking your</p>
<p>brain is seeing the very strong other man. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s like makes them appealing or a leader. You think like, okay, that that&#x27;s what I want. But then what they serve you is something that&#x27;s much easier to get, which is, oh, do this routine. But really, like in your lizard brain, you&#x27;re admiring this guy because, you know, he&#x27;s jacked and then he&#x27;s laundering that admiration for something that was very hard for him to do and probably took years and years of of concerted nutrition and working out. It&#x27;s hijacking that uh and then aiming it at things that much more approximate</p>
<p>like, oh, I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll wake up early. I&#x27;ll gargle water or whatever. &gt;&gt; I think you&#x27;ve got part of that right and part of that wrong. I think the part of it that you have right is um the rationale behind like the aesthetic of the really muscular guy that hijacks especially a masculine lizard brain. I think the part that you have wrong is that those people had a really good approach and worked really hard. I think an easier answer is that steroids work very well. Um and I don&#x27;t think that either of those two gentlemen would ever be able to compete in any kind of</p>
<p>sanctioned athletic event with drug testing. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you how steroids work? This just I&#x27;m just curious now. I mean, it&#x27;s still like what would happen? All right, here&#x27;s my thought experiment. I don&#x27;t know how steroids work, but like what would be possible if I wanted to be a shirtless influencer giving my morning routine? How long would it take and what would be involved? Like if to be notably sort of bulbous, that&#x27;s like a year of taking steroids and exercising. I I&#x27;ve heard steroids allows you to recover faster, you can work out harder or something, but I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not an expert on steroids. What I do know is that there&#x27;s research that shows</p>
<p>that simply taking steroids without even training uh can increase hypertrophy, which is just a fancy way of saying muscle size by up to 20%. So, if you got the right steroids, you could just take the steroids and do nothing and be 20% bigger and stronger. And then if you took a ton of steroids and you trained really hard twice a week for an hour, you would get jacked. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, yeah. Stero steroids really really work. Um they&#x27;re also extremely unregulated. Uh there&#x27;s a lot of research that shows that they lead to uh negative adverse cardiovascular events,</p>
<p>cancer, all sorts of bad things. Uh they&#x27;re not allowed if you want to compete. But if your goal is to just look really really jacked and you don&#x27;t care about your longevity in your health or your ability to assess risk properly, then take steroids. But I&#x27;m not condoning that. &gt;&gt; If you&#x27;re in a Marvel movie, then you&#x27;re definitely doing that, right? &gt;&gt; I think so. I think that I I again I don&#x27;t know because I I I I I&#x27;m not working with those actors, but I I would sense that they&#x27;re getting some help uh to to get into those kinds of bodies for those for those movies. And you could</p>
<p>argue that that&#x27;s just part of their job. And sometimes jobs require you to make trade-offs with health. They&#x27;re not competing in a sanctioned sport, so it&#x27;s not against the rules. However, big however, the problem becomes when 19-year-old Bill or Joey is looking at those guys and those guys aren&#x27;t disclosing all the steroids that they&#x27;re taking. And 19-year-old Bill or Joey says, &quot;The way that I get that body is by waking up at a.m. and meditating and journaling and doing a cold plunge and taking these 19 supplements.&quot; That, by the way, the guys that are using the steroids are always selling supplements. It&#x27;s never the supplements. It&#x27;s always</p>
<p>the steroids that they&#x27;re not telling you about that make them look like that. That&#x27;s the problem. That&#x27;s the grift. And it&#x27;s a grift as old as time. &gt;&gt; Uh, one of the funnier tweets someone sent me recently was a picture of Himsworth with his Thor body and it said, this was Chris Himsworth at age 42. What&#x27;s your excuse? And someone replied, I&#x27;m not yet 42 yet. I appreciated that. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s great. But it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a real thing. And and and I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a kaggen. It&#x27;s just like I&#x27;ve been around elite athletes for a long enough time where um it&#x27;s very apparent who&#x27;s working extremely hard in doing it</p>
<p>naturally in what they look like and someone who might not be working very hard at all but who has a very serious steroid regimen. &gt;&gt; And a good way to tell the difference is to ask does this person have hard athletic competitions that they&#x27;re preparing for? In which case it&#x27;s a diff a completely different mindset for a lot of these things because steroid muscles that&#x27;s not what you need to compete. you need like the actual functional strength, the actual cardio base, and it looks really different. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right. And and I think the ultimate way to ask is essentially, does this person look superhuman? And if the answer is yes, then they&#x27;re probably not</p>
<p>human. Uh, is this person telling you that they only sleep six hours a night, but they look like that, then they&#x27;re either lying about how much they sleep or they&#x27;re taking steroids or some combination of the two. All right, so we&#x27;ve been talking a lot about muscles, so let&#x27;s do one more example that has nothing to do with muscles, but also ties in the pseudo excellence because you&#x27;ve written about this example before. I think we&#x27;ve talked about this before. All right, let me load this up. All right, here we go. This is Elon Musk. He&#x27;s at CPAC. He&#x27;s been given a chainsaw for the president of Argentina and is holding it in the air roaring as the crowd cheers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The chainsaw for bureaucracy. Chainsaw. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s how I start every one of my classes, actually. So, I think I &gt;&gt; with the chainsaw for bureaucracy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. So here&#x27;s a gentleman who is I can say for sure is not taking steroids. So he is not using his body to lure in young men to be attracted. But I&#x27;ve heard you write and talk about this in the context of pseudo excellence. So what what&#x27;s the variant we&#x27;re seeing here? &gt;&gt; Well, a couple things. I think that Elon Musk um is is clearly a maniac and an outlier figure and I think that some of the things that he&#x27;s done in his career</p>
<p>have been genuinely excellent. Uh, I think that building Tesla, building SpaceX, I mean, maybe you get lucky once, but it&#x27;s extremely hard to get lucky with multiple companies that are truly revolutionary. Um, I don&#x27;t want to diagnose Elon Musk. I think what happened is he got addicted to social media and it really changed his brain in negative ways and made him in many ways less serious. Um, so in this particular clip, uh, we&#x27;re marching around with a chainsaw talking about, you know, cuts to bureaucracy and look at how tough I am. And it&#x27;s just like it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all</p>
<p>show. It&#x27;s very performative. It doesn&#x27;t say actually anything about what are you doing to make government better. Um, the the metaphor that I used when I wrote about that was it&#x27;s the difference between WWE wrestling and the best wrestlers who are actually in these Midwest Big 10 schools like Iowa and Penn State in Purdue. Um, there&#x27;s those are two very different things, right? The WWE wrestlers are taking steroids and they&#x27;re acting and they&#x27;re playing a role and it&#x27;s all a performance and it&#x27;s invigorating and it hooks your attention, but they&#x27;re not actually good wrestlers. the best wrestlers in the</p>
<p>world are competing in dink gyms and could beat the crap out of any of those WWE guys and are winning medals at the Olympics in in an actual serious genuine heartfelt sport. &gt;&gt; So, here&#x27;s a big question I want to try to figure out about all of this. There&#x27;s a couple different ways of trying to understand the appeal of pseudo excellence. I I think there&#x27;s a tendency for a lot of commentators to look at it from the point of view of like shallow vanities like well I don&#x27;t know this like this type of stuff appeals to people&#x27;s um shallow vanities it&#x27;s I want to look great that I want to</p>
<p>attract women or what have you. There&#x27;s the other argument that I&#x27;ve been exploring as well, which is well actually no, people are wired for ambition, right? Because it&#x27;s our paleolithic past. If you are doing stuff that&#x27;s hard and impressive, you people are going to share food, you&#x27;re going to get mates. Like we&#x27;re wired to want to pursue things that are hard and visibly hard. Uh that&#x27;s a deep drive. And that what&#x27;s really happening here is that these types of pseudo excellent purveyors are hijacking a deeper completely nonp problematic like just like a like hunger thirst or whatever just like a human drive we have are</p>
<p>hijacking it for other purposes like getting more uh engagement on their particular channels. Where do you fall on this? Hey, you know, shame on you for being attracted to this. This is just you being vain versus like, no, no, this is hijacking a deeper drive, just like pornography does that or Tik Tok hijacks your boredom drive, etc. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m very much on the it&#x27;s hijacking a drive. I actually don&#x27;t think most people are vain. I think a lot of people feel confused, lost, numbed out, alienated, going through the motions. And I think you come across videos like those and they&#x27;re extremely motivating</p>
<p>and they&#x27;re inspiring and they&#x27;re energizing and they create this kind of illusion that yeah, like I can do it. I can be a tough guy. Like I&#x27;m going to go crush. Uh and that feeling is what people are chasing. And again, like you said, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a superficial version of actually crushing it. And it does great for the people purveying it because it draws so much attention. uh but it doesn&#x27;t actually lead to sustainable progress or excellence for for the people that fall prey to it. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a vanity thing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an evil thing. Uh I think people just are desperate to exert themselves</p>
<p>and to feel good and to try to find mastery and skill and meaning and mattering in their life and you come across a video like that and if you&#x27;ve been struggling uh I can see why it would be very alluring and very enticing and very motivating. &gt;&gt; How much does the format matter? Because when there&#x27;s video involved, not just video, let&#x27;s put it this way. When there&#x27;s engagement metrics involved and there&#x27;s virality possible, so Instagram, so YouTube, etc., it feels like you get more shirtless guys with the big muscles. But on the other hand, if you sample like podcasts for within the what might be part of what people would</p>
<p>deride as the manosphere, but like um you know, the the order of man or the art of manliness or or some of these whatever these podcasts are like, hey, we want to help men be better men. If you listen to the rhetoric on those podcasts, it&#x27;s often very grounded. It&#x27;s like you want to provide for your family, you want to be a good husband and dad, you want to be there for your kids, it&#x27;s good to be in shape so that you know you can you can play ball with your kid and not be winded or whatever. And then as soon as you move out of that slower format where you do slow growth of audiences over time and towards something where virality is at play, you&#x27;re putting your face in ice water at</p>
<p>3 in the morning. Is this am I oversimplifying things by saying this is like a the technology format matters? No, you&#x27;re not. I think the format matters a lot. I think if you have a podcast that is dependent on virality and your goal is growth. So the top of your values hierarchy is growth. It&#x27;s not integrity. It&#x27;s not the truth. It&#x27;s not mission. It&#x27;s I just want to grow. You&#x27;re going to end up reverse engineering your shows to chase whatever is the most attentiongrabbing and viral on the internet at that moment. And that&#x27;s why you see some of the the biggest podcast essentially just cycle from one fad to the next and one trend</p>
<p>to the next and they grow and they have tons of listeners but their listeners are often caught up in this this cyclical nature and not really making much progress in their life. Um so I think the the deep to use your term slow approach to progress to building an audience like that that&#x27;s where we should be gravitating towards. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we&#x27;ve gendered this with our examples. Like these seem like men appealing examples, but women generally speaking have their own share of pseudo excellence. Some of the themes are different. I think they&#x27;re less interested in well maybe they are interested in giant shirtless</p>
<p>men, but there&#x27;s other types of things that are appealing to them. Like what goes on? This is a dangerous question. What does uh female gender pseudo excellence look like online? &gt;&gt; I think it looks like a couple of things. Um, I think that there&#x27;s a lot of uh body dysmorphia and body image things. So, um, these are the people that are selling all of these very restrictive diets or ways to have a body that looks a certain way. I think sometimes it&#x27;s also the person that&#x27;s saying like, &quot;Look, I eat this cheeseburger and fries and I still have a size two dress.&quot; And, you know, it&#x27;s</p>
<p>just like nonsense. You don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going on in that person&#x27;s life, but it it surrounds body image. Um there&#x27;s a whole very interesting area of the internet called the trad wife uh sphere. Yeah. Where it&#x27;s about like being this traditional wife. Um where you know you you stay at home and you take care of the kids and you don&#x27;t have to work because the man&#x27;s making income, but what&#x27;s interesting is the the biggest trades have very intense, rigorous jobs. They&#x27;re working 12 hours a day producing content for the internet, which is a job in and of itself. Um, so I think that that&#x27;s another another place that this happens</p>
<p>with women. And then I think that um what&#x27;s incredible is that especially in sport and athletics, women&#x27;s sport has come such a long way um that you actually see a lot of the same, you know, elaborate kabuki that dudes do with their shirt off with women and, you know, they have a sports bra on, but that&#x27;s the only difference. They&#x27;re flexing their muscles. They&#x27;re talking about how they&#x27;re superwoman and they just take these 19 supplements and they just wake up at 2 a.m. Um, and then I think that there&#x27;s this third area that you perhaps know um about as well, Cal, which is this like uh study habits kind of like I&#x27;m going to wake up, you know,</p>
<p>6 hours before the sun comes up to study. I&#x27;m going to take four Celsius energy drinks. Uh I&#x27;m going to get an Adderall prescription stolen from my best friend. and like look at all the studying I can cram in to to these four hours before my competition is ready. Uh makes for great content on the internet. Maybe is sustainable for a week or two. Uh but I don&#x27;t think anyone created groundbreaking theory or got through medical school uh you know between 3 and 10 in the morning studying for seven hours straight. &gt;&gt; I mean I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re</p>
<p>studying. This is my area right? I mean, not only have I written books on this, but when I was at Dartmouth, I got basically the highest grades you can possibly get, right? I mean, I think I was in like the top handful of GPA of over a thousand students there. You couldn&#x27;t get higher grades than I got. I didn&#x27;t study that much. I certainly never studied all night long. I certainly wasn&#x27;t ever sitting in a room for 12 hours at a time. And and I was a computer science major. I had hard classes. So, I always wonder that&#x27;s how I know that&#x27;s Kabuki. There&#x27;s not enough stuff to study in college to require</p>
<p>that much time. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, but yeah, that to me that that hits home as one of the more ridiculous. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And but it&#x27;s the same theme, right? It&#x27;s the performance of the thing versus actually doing the thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. So, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s switch to what we should do instead. This is where your book comes into the picture, right? The way of excellence is all about how to get sustainable excellence in your life. how to make it a a source of ongoing meaning and satisfaction. How to avoid both the traps of pseudo excellence and the trap of</p>
<p>non-engagement. The trap of just sort of of of of non-action and feeling that sort of um inefficacious frustration. So, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s talk about I have a few factors I want to go through, but let&#x27;s do like the the the over the highlevel picture first. What is the big mindset shift we need to make if we&#x27;re coming from pseudo excellence land to excellence land? The same drive is there. We want to but we want to put it somewhere that&#x27;s actually going to work that&#x27;s sustainable. What&#x27;s the big mindset shift we need to make?

So, excellence is not a standard. It&#x27;s a process of becoming and it&#x27;s becoming the best performer that you can be, but also the best person that you can be. It&#x27;s shaping</p>
<p>your character. &gt;&gt; Define excellence. &gt;&gt; I want to stop you, Brad, because I want to do another Mel Robbins moment because I think that&#x27;s important. It&#x27;s not a standard. I think people often think about that excellence is, oh, you&#x27;re ranked X out of this many people. You&#x27;re placing this high in the races. It&#x27;s like an objective standard towards which you&#x27;re competing. You&#x27;re saying no. &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s a process and and in and the byproduct of that process might be that you attain a certain level or a certain ranking, but there is no arriving with excellence. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s an ongoing</p>
<p>pursuit. That&#x27;s what makes it so endlessly fascinating and fulfilling. Um, it is involved engagement, caring deeply about worthwhile pursuits that align with your values and goals. And both parts of those definitions are really important. So the involved engagement, the caring deeply is intention. It&#x27;s focus. It&#x27;s actually giving a damn. It&#x27;s not just mimicking what someone else is doing. It is giving a damn. Not feigning nonchalants. not being too cool to care, but saying I&#x27;m going to give this thing my all. And then how do you select the thing? It&#x27;s</p>
<p>not go on the internet and look at what everyone else is doing. It&#x27;s ask yourself what are my values? Like what kind of person do I want to become? How do I want to spend my time? What do I want to grow from? Uh what challenges do I want to undertake that are going to help shape me as a person? And then selecting goals that align with those values and those challenges. And you put those two things together, caring, deeply involved engagement and things that align with your values and goals. And that puts you on the path to excellence, to fulfillment, to life satisfaction, to mastery, to mattering, to contribution, to all these things that we long for.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So once you get in that the habit, you learn how to do that to be like, &quot;Okay, this thing seems worthwhile. I&#x27;ve chosen it well. Align with my values. Then I&#x27;m really going to go into I&#x27;m going to be involved engagement. I&#x27;m not going to be embarrassed about it. I&#x27;m not going to hide it. I&#x27;m just going to go in all in it.&quot; Throughout life, you&#x27;ll have many different occasions to apply that. And overall, it&#x27;s going to lead to a lot of these other good things. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. Um, one of my favorite uh pieces of reporting I did for the book is with the the master craftsman Peter Korn. And he talks about that how for the longest time he thought that he was trying to make a table in his wood shop that was really durable and had</p>
<p>integrity, but then he realized that what he was actually after was instilling the qualities of durability and integrity in himself. So, it&#x27;s an orientation toward what you&#x27;re doing that you love the craft and the craft is going to love you back. And you can get this as a researcher, as a coach, as a teacher, as an executive, as an athlete, as an artist, as a musician. And you can get this if you&#x27;ve won three Grammys, but you can also get this if you&#x27;re just picking up guitar for the first time as a 45-year-old adult.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s interesting. I think it&#x27;s important this idea of it&#x27;s not just what you chose, it&#x27;s about how you approach it. and what you&#x27;re trying to get out of it. Can we use you as a case study? Right. So, so, uh, one of your big hobbies is is you do powerlifting. Is that the right term? &gt;&gt; That is the right term. Really, the deadlift is is is my favorite movement to use as an example because it&#x27;s actually my favorite movement. And you could argue it&#x27;s the most meaningless thing in the world. It&#x27;s literally just spending hours and hours and hours perfecting the technique of picking a barbell from the ground to your hips. You don&#x27;t even have to put it above your</p>
<p>head. It&#x27;s just, can you lift this thing from the ground to your hips? But there&#x27;s there&#x27;s multiple ways you could approach even that same activity. Right. So I knowing you well I know you sort of see a lot of values about life reflected in it and and I I&#x27;ll let you speak to those. But also there&#x27;s like another way you could approach that as well which would involve like I guess I don&#x27;t know constantly bragging to I don&#x27;t know what you I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I just know in the gym there&#x27;s many ways people could approach that that they&#x27;re approaching it entirely for the numbers they can brag about the the body they can show off by walking shirtless all the time. You know</p>
<p>same activity but the approach matters. You approach it in a way that generates a lot of meaning. And I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve met people on the powerlifting circuit who uh are approaching this for other reasons. And that makes a big difference about how it impacts your life. &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s right. I think in the case of powerlifting, the people that are more superficial about it where it&#x27;s just about bragging and like looking like really strong. Uh those are the people that tend to do steroids and when I compete, uh it&#x27;s just a matter of of my own ethics. I always compete in drug tested divisions. So the people that I come across are actually like all philosophers because to spend that much time trying to lift a heavy weight from</p>
<p>the ground to your hips, you kind of have to become a philosopher. Uh but that&#x27;s just right. Like what I&#x27;ve gotten out of deadlifting 530 lbs is not bigger quadriceps or a bigger back. What I&#x27;ve gotten out of that is learning about feeling uncomfortable in making myself vulnerable in failing and overcoming setbacks in dealing with the fear that you face before you step up to a bar that has more weight on it than you&#x27;ve ever had before. It&#x27;s taught me how to be patient when all you want is for that bar to get moving, but it&#x27;s not. Like, how do you stay with the lift? How do you not freak out? Um, it&#x27;s taught me</p>
<p>about community and the power of training partners. It&#x27;s taught me about coaching and mentorship. Both the people who have coached and mentored me and the people that I help coach and mentor. Um, that&#x27;s what I get out of it. It&#x27;s not about picking the bar up from my feet to my hips. It&#x27;s about all of those things. And I&#x27;m not a world champion deadlifter, but Lane Norton is. And I interviewed him for the book. And even though he lifts, you know, 723 lbs, significantly more than me, when he talks about what keeps him coming back to the pursuit, it&#x27;s not the medals. It&#x27;s all the things that he learns about himself. It&#x27;s the</p>
<p>endless curiosity. Greg Papovich, the winningest basketball coach of all time, in his Hall of Fame induction speech, literally said, Cal, &quot;Forget the wins and losses. You think they matter. They don&#x27;t matter nearly as much as you think. What matters is who you become along the way and the relationships that you forge.&quot; This is the winningest coach ever saying that. Hillary Han, Grammy-winning musician, she talks about how the violin and practicing the violin is really a way to practice being who she authentically is and to shape herself. So, it&#x27;s not just let&#x27;s all hold hands and sing kumbaya and be a philosopher like Brad in the gym. This</p>
<p>is also true for people who are the best in the world at what they do. And it&#x27;s so different than the going through the motions mimicry that defines pseudo excellence. Um, and that&#x27;s why I get so fired up about this. It&#x27;s why I wrote the book. Like excellence is a beautiful thing. We can&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bathwater. We need to reclaim the real thing and try to make it a part of all of our lives. &gt;&gt; All right, I want to do a couple scenarios to help people think about how to concretely do this in their own life. Um because I think the answers differ a little bit based on what scenario we&#x27;re talking about. So um I&#x27;ll give a scenario and then my question is going to be if you&#x27;re this person and you don&#x27;t have excellence in your</p>
<p>life, maybe you have some pseudo excellence but you feel that drive, how do you get started? So, the first scenario I want to give is let&#x27;s think about like a young person. Uh, you&#x27;re in your 20s, maybe you&#x27;re in like your first or second, you know, you&#x27;re in your first job out of college, and it&#x27;s, you know, you&#x27;re you&#x27;re working, you&#x27;re playing video games, you&#x27;re hanging out with your friends, you know, going out a few nights a week, and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re starting to feel this itch to like, I want to be doing something more impressive, right? I&#x27;m just answering emails and like drinking with my friends. In that scenario, what is the right few steps towards injecting true excellence into your life?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think the first thing is to ask yourself, are you feigning an attitude of nonchalants? Like, I&#x27;m kind of too cool to care. Uh, and if so, is it because you&#x27;re scared to step into the arena and to potentially fail? And if that&#x27;s the case, you have to get over that fear of stepping into the arena and failing and say, you know what, I&#x27;m willing to embarrass myself. I&#x27;m willing to risk failure because I know that on the other side of caring deeply, I&#x27;m going to unlock my potential and I&#x27;m going to find a lot of meaning and satisfaction. The second thing that I would say is, have you defined your goals in a way that makes sense? Like,</p>
<p>do you know what your values are? Do you know how you want to spend your time? Again, are you just pursuing things because it&#x27;s what the cool people do or because it&#x27;s what your parents think you should do or what you&#x27;ve been told that you should do? Have you actually stepped back and say, &quot;Hey, you know, these are the things that I&#x27;m reasonably good at. this is how I like to spend my time. What would it look like to actually spend my time this way? And I can speak from personal experience. I mean, I went to the University of Michigan and I was a really smart student, good enough to get in. I was a very good athlete in high school and I got to school in the first two years of school. I did well because I&#x27;m smart, but like I drank a</p>
<p>lot of beer. I smoked a lot of pot. And um my junior year, I read Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. And it kind of clicked that like, wow, like I could have an intellectual life and I could I could write and I could do these things and instead of smoking pot and listening to Pink Floyd, I actually want to start reading the classics. And I got made fun of by all my housemates. They said like Brad is anti-fun because when they went to smoke pot and listen to Pink Floyd, I read the classics. And I&#x27;m not judging. A lot of people smoke pot throughout all of college and end up having great lives. But for me, it kind of took that leap of faith to be like, &quot;No, that</p>
<p>that&#x27;s not who I am. At least it&#x27;s not who I am anymore.&quot; and it&#x27;s okay if it&#x27;s not cool, but I want to throw myself into this thing that really interests me and excites me and um see see what I can get out of it. So it sounds like if you&#x27;re in that age bracket, something that might help would be get off social media because that is going to create that&#x27;s like your issue with your housemates times a billion because now in your mind you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, I am in this arena where everyone is scrutinizing me and waiting for me to make the slightest move to show that I&#x27;m too earnest or too cool or if I do this</p>
<p>activity, maybe this activity associated with this person and this person is associated with a problematic belief and oh my god and everything is you&#x27;re so careful. I see this a lot in 20-year-olds. you become so careful about everything you put that away then maybe that is going to be an important precondition like okay I can just actually have involved engagement in something because I&#x27;m not actually at the center of like a massive attention firestorm people don&#x27;t really care so I can care about what I want to care about &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s right and and and I want to give an example from someone in that age group that&#x27;s a a pretty um extreme example is the Heisman Trophy winner</p>
<p>this year in college football uh Fernando Mendoza quarterback of of Indiana and Mendoza is known for like really caring deeply. He&#x27;ll even cry in postgame interviews. And after they beat Ohio State to win the Big 10 and to be ranked number one in the country and probably uh Mendoza gave this onfield interview and like he was just so freaking earnest. Like you could just tell like this guy was living his excellence. And afterwards on the internet he just got made fun of so hard. All the Bartow still sports guys were like, &quot;Did Mendoza just lose the</p>
<p>Heisman with that interview?&quot; Well, you know what happened a week later? Mendoza won the Heisman. And as of this recording, Indiana&#x27;s one of two teams left in football. Those losers on Bar Stool that are making fun of him are sitting being talking heads. Well, this guy&#x27;s the best freaking quarterback in the sport. So, like, yeah, you got to step outside of that bubble because if you&#x27;re in that bubble and you&#x27;re letting it affect who you are and how you show up, you&#x27;re never going to get the best out of yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it&#x27;s like when we were young, remember Tim Tibo was getting all sorts of crap for being like having open like religious displays of celebration</p>
<p>or whatever where clearly he was just like super gracious. He&#x27;s like, man, the fact that I&#x27;m here and I get to play this and I just made a good play. And so, you know, he was thanking God, but more importantly, he was like showing like immense emotional gratitude for this is, you know, a fantastic thing I get to do and I&#x27;m lucky and this is fantastic. And just was so gracious about what was happening. And the reaction, and this was even pre-ocial media, was like, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s a loser thing to do.&quot; You know? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. Because he&#x27;s not the cool</p>
<p>guy with the the the mouth tape and the nose strip waking up at 4 a.m. with his steroid muscles. He&#x27;s too busy winning a national championship in college football. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. So, now let&#x27;s say um we&#x27;ll go fully hypothetical. You&#x27;re like a 43 year old male with a with with three kids and you&#x27;re busy and work and you know you you wake up one day and you&#x27;re like, I want more excellence in my life. I think I have a lot of listeners who are more of our stage of life. So now you don&#x27;t have as much time and you&#x27;re in a place where culture is saying like no man&#x27;s dad bod time. Like let&#x27;s roll. Like this is fine. like you you have your job and you you know you</p>
<p>have your kids and now it&#x27;s time to you can let the other things go and relax when you can. What is like reintegrating excellence look like you know early mid-E? &gt;&gt; I think it depends on whether or not you have the opportunity to pursue these things in your workplace. Um, if you do and there&#x27;s an opportunity to job craft and to to make your job a real challenge that is pushing you, that&#x27;s allowing you to work toward big goals that align with your values, then I think that&#x27;s a really fortunate position to be in. And you should take your work very seriously. And you should remember that the things that you work on also work on</p>
<p>you. So, you&#x27;re not just trying to build, you know, your team at the office or get the promotion to senior vice president because of the salary or because of the success for the company. you&#x27;re also doing it in a way that&#x27;s going to make you a better person. It&#x27;s going to make you a better leader. Uh this is true if you&#x27;re a salesperson. This is true if you are an individual knowledge worker contributor. This is true if you&#x27;re a leader of a team. For another cohort of individuals who might say, you know what, Brad, I work a 9 to5. My job is really boring, but it pays the bills. I can send my kids uh to to to public schools and the good</p>
<p>extracurriculars and like I just I&#x27;m never going to find that in my job. But that&#x27;s okay. Um, what I would say is that you can have a craft in your leisure time, a hobby, an activity that you pursue with this mindset of involved engagement in something that aligns with your values and goals. We talked about how for me it&#x27;s powerlifting. There are people for which this is guitar or coding or watercolor or sculpting or gardening, you know, on and on. Woodworking. The activity doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is that you have this thing where you can put your concrete effortful exertion in and see</p>
<p>progress that you can trace back to yourself. That is so satisfying. And again, that helps shape you as a person. And I think that when you do this in in leisure and in hobbies, in some ways, it can be even more advantageous than in the workplace because in your leisure time, you have full agency. Like you don&#x27;t have to worry about the opinions of your co colleagues or a boss telling you what to do. you can really set up the craft to get exactly what you want out of it. So, I find myself to be very, very fortunate. I think writing is a craft and I totally pursue excellence professionally. However, I get just as much out of how I pursue deadlifting,</p>
<p>even though I&#x27;m never going to win a state championship, let alone a national championship. Like, I&#x27;m good, but I&#x27;m not that good. But because I can tailor it in a way that I am getting these characteristics and I&#x27;m working on myself, not just the barbell, I find it so gratifying and so fulfilling. I I think it&#x27;s a really good point about you can find excellence within your professional world. It&#x27;s a thing I&#x27;ve observed is that for prior generations like our parents&#x27; generation and the generations before that this was just a given. It was like yeah if you have a job as you advance into like your 40s and 50s you look to step up and to be</p>
<p>like this is very meaningful. I&#x27;m a leader. These are my people. I manage. This is like a family. Like I take this very seriously. I would remember going to like my dad&#x27;s office and he knew he would knew the backstory and name of every single person he would pass like oh so you know how is like your kid doing with the test he was taking last week or whatever it was this is a big source of meaning is like yeah you&#x27;re a leader of a like economically productive tribe our generation the millennials we went through this phase with the economic crisis post 911 that really uh shifted us I&#x27;ve written about this</p>
<p>before hardcore towards like lifestyle design and and you know thinking about what exactly do I want in my life and trying to craft your life in very careful ways which had a lot of benefits to it&#x27;s how we it was a smart reaction when we were in our 20s and dealing with like the economy imploding but I think it&#x27;s taken us longer to rediscover for a lot of people it&#x27;s like well actually now that I&#x27;m you know promoted to be head of this school or I&#x27;m in charge of this large team or something like that that could become a real source of excellence and meaning if I&#x27;m willing to be engaged in it in a meaningful way and</p>
<p>say this is important this is these people&#x27;s livelihoods. This is a company with a long history and I want to be a really good leader. Uh we we I&#x27;m rediscovering that as well. I think a lot of us from our generation sort of lost that play that was part of the standard playbook. Uh and tell &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right. And and I think what we lose and I think the the kind of dismissive way to think about this is oh you&#x27;re just talking about like the company man that gives your life to the company or the company woman. And that&#x27;s one way to think about it. But the other way to think about it is actually uh yeah, I want the company to do well</p>
<p>because I work for them, but what I really want is to challenge myself as a leader because that&#x27;s going to affect how I show up as a husband or wife, as a mom or dad, as a friend, as a community member, uh so on and so forth. So the best cultures, the the person shaping the organization, but the way that the person shows up is also um excuse me, the way that the person shows up in the organization is shaping the organization, but the organization is also shaping the person. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a two-way street. And some people just don&#x27;t have it. Some people just work a boring nineto-five where you&#x27;re filling out a couple spreadsheets and maybe it&#x27;s</p>
<p>actually like a nineto and maybe you could get that job done in 3 hours and then that&#x27;s awesome because now you&#x27;ve got all this time and agency where you get to choose. You could numb yourself out with passive scrolling and consumption or you could define a craft that you want to work towards mastery in and pursue excellence in that craft in a way that is every bit as gratifying as someone who gets to do it professionally. All right. So, final thing I want to ask you about. We talked about how the internet can hijack this drive and keep us away from this true excellence and put us towards pseudo excellence. So, what is the technology prescription here? Is it to to think</p>
<p>about true excellence as a largely offline endeavor? Um or is it to have a a different way more careful way or more targeted way of using the internet? What is the role of internet in true excellence? Um, do we use it carefully or do we separate these two? &gt;&gt; I mean, the internet, Cal, you know better than anyone. It&#x27;s such a a broad amorphous being, a broad amorphous term. I think is a source of information and a place to educate oneself. I think that</p>
<p>the internet can be really powerful because it has so much good information. But I also think it can be really dangerous. Forget social media. you could just go down the wrong rabbit holes of websites and be completely thrown uh off the path because the information that you have is garbage. Um so I guess the way that I like to think about the internet is it&#x27;s a tool with potential benefit but also with a lot of harm and you have to be really careful about how you use the tool and I think the internet should be a a way station instead of a terminal endpoint. So what I mean by that is if you go to the</p>
<p>internet and you find a community great then meet those people in real life. If you go to the internet and you find a lot of information then great find a real life coach and go discuss that information with them. I think when we end up terminally online bad things tend to happen and we tend to get thrown astray. When we use the internet as a way station I think it&#x27;s an incredible source of excellence. I mean I met you some 10 years ago over the internet. Now we are best of friends in real life and you&#x27;ve imbued my life with so much meaning both intellectually and just as a great friend. The internet empowered</p>
<p>that but it was a way station right like that&#x27;s where we kind of met and then it wasn&#x27;t the terminal point. The terminal point is our friendship. And I think that increasingly we&#x27;ve got to think about the internet is a means to a different terminal end and that terminal end is probably somewhere in the analog world. Ironically, the way we first discovered ourselves was the the video I put up of me shirtless saying, &quot;You need to put your your head in scalding water for 10 minutes at a time to get your day started, right?&quot; So, that that viral content. Um, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s why I have no hair on my head, Cal, because I took your advice and I</p>
<p>burned it all off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You didn&#x27;t realize I was faking it. I That was CGI water. You were the You took the mistakes. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Um, all right. I That I love that idea, by the way, is like the internet can only be a way if it&#x27;s where you end up problem. If it gives you stuff you&#x27;re using in the real life, then like it could be completely useful. All right, I want to add one more final question because it&#x27;s just relevant to you and I. We both have sons um you know, young boys and uh that we&#x27;re parenting. But let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a parent and you know, you&#x27;re looking around and there&#x27;s like young kids around you. They&#x27;re on their phones. It&#x27;s now like 75% of the</p>
<p>whatever the generation younger than Jinz&#x27;s ambition is to be like an influencer because it&#x27;s the only thing they really know. What&#x27;s the parenting advice to set someone who is young on a path away from internet pseudo excellence and towards the the joys of real excellence? &gt;&gt; Be about it. Don&#x27;t just talk about it. Like let your young child see you pursuing uh some sort of craft. Uh let them see you training at the gym. Let them see you trying to learn an instrument. Let them see you are in the garden uh trying to to become a master gardener. Um, I think that we do a lot</p>
<p>of telling and talking to our kids about these problems, but then if we&#x27;re just constantly consuming media on our phone all day, like talk is cheap. Uh, I think the best way to role model a life orientation or a philosophy of excellence in your kid is to to do it in yourself. So, if you want this for your kid, then you&#x27;ve got to find an activity or a craft or a job or some combination of those things that allows you to show your kid what it looks like to care deeply and give something your all and work really hard at it um in a way that is not superficial or performative, but</p>
<p>is deep and real. This is my problem is that I do have things I show my kids that I work really hard on, but I also have one of those YouTube way to get a 100,000 subscriber plaques up in my office. like that is sending them the wrong message. I constantly give them lectures about do not do this. This is not a job. Like whenever they&#x27;re at my studio, it&#x27;s like do not aspire to do this. This is it&#x27;s one thing if you&#x27;re like a writer and you have like a podcast that goes on there, but like don&#x27;t this is not a destination. I feel like I have to constantly try to anti- glorify</p>
<p>staring into a camera and recording YouTube videos because that that&#x27;s they do pick up what you show. I was like, forget that. Watch me writing in the office. That&#x27;s the thing that matters &gt;&gt; and that&#x27;s what enables the YouTube channel. So, I think like that plaque on the wall like that was never the goal. You know, your goal wasn&#x27;t to be a YouTuber or an influencer. Your goal was to be uh a really freaking good computer scientist and then the best ideas writer that you could be. And the the YouTube like that&#x27;s uh that is secondary. That&#x27;s like a byproduct. It&#x27;s like when you go to the gym, you know, you do your deadlift or your squat or your shoulder</p>
<p>press and then you do a secondary exercise. So, maybe a Romanian deadlift. Um, uh, maybe something for your back. And then at the very end of your workout, you do your biceps and triceps, okay? But like that&#x27;s the stuff that if you don&#x27;t have time, you don&#x27;t do to me. Like the big YouTube platform is your biceps and triceps. And as long as you&#x27;re doing that deadlift, and if that&#x27;s leads to you having the YouTube platform, that&#x27;s great. Uh, but I think it&#x27;s an interesting metaphor because I think there&#x27;s a lot of people with really big YouTube platforms that have really big biceps, but they can&#x27;t deadlift anything. Well, the metaphor works because if you look on the wall, and you&#x27;ve seen this, you&#x27;ve been at my</p>
<p>studio a bunch of times, but at there&#x27;s the YouTube plaque is on the wall. Above it, so symbolically above it is a a a framed cover of one of my books and its appearance uh up high on the New York Times bestseller list. So, it&#x27;s like that was actually the thing that lets this other thing happen downstream uh which could take her leave. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just talking to our kids. I mean, I think we&#x27;re lucky like the parents that I feel for and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s many listening are are parents whose kids are like in high school or early college right now um who like we&#x27;re just starting to really grasp</p>
<p>like what this internet culture does and what these technologies do. So now we can reckon with it. Um, but the the kids who are kind of like the initial uh the initial subjects in the experiment of mass algorithmic distraction. Um, I mean I feel for those parents because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s got to be a really challenging situation, especially if you&#x27;re, you know, you&#x27;re listening to to this podcast and the other parents are just like, &quot;Yeah, take the phone, take the iPad, get on the social media, whatever.&quot; I could imagine that also causes a lot of tension. Um, so I think you just got to love the crap out of your kids. And you&#x27;ve got to not just</p>
<p>talk about it, be about it. Um, and then sometimes make the choice that might lead to some short-term tension with your child, but is in their best long-term interest. &gt;&gt; All right, I love this. This has been great. This has been a good idea segment. Uh, Brad, thank you. And probably the best approximate advice we can give everyone in the audience is that if you want to get away from internet field of excellence towards true excellence by the way of excellence, Brad&#x27;s book just came out. As I mentioned, you know, Steve Kerr is right there on the cover, but the back is all sorts of like incredibly accomplished performers plus me, who is</p>
<p>by far the the least skilled person on your book, Brad. kind of I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s not photos with blurbs because you have like these world champion athletes and then you have an idea writer but buy that book way of excellence the way is uh everywhere everywhere you can buy books and you also have what&#x27;s the website for them to immediately find out all the information wayof excellence.com &gt;&gt; I should know this uh see I&#x27;m about the main thing not about the marketing of it &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s important &gt;&gt; it is wayof excellencebook.com &gt;&gt; excellent okay so there you go uh read the book it it is fantastic Fantastic.</p>
<p>And it will help guide you if you&#x27;re interested in this through the transition. All right, Brad. Um, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have you on again soon. But thanks again. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Cal. This is a pleasure. &gt;&gt; All right, so there we go, Jesse. That was my conversation with Brad. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m convinced that the internet is hijacking your ambition or if my message from that interview was like you and I should do more hustle culture content. It needs to be a lot more. What I imagine is is a table full of supplements and I&#x27;m in a a sleeveless shirt just kind of flexing furiously as</p>
<p>I walk through my anti-aging routine. I think we would kill it &gt;&gt; possibly. &gt;&gt; I think I need to look younger though. That&#x27;s the problem. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still trying to think about the Steve Kerr cuz he won championships as a player and as a coach. I think he won five with Golden State then four with the Bulls. &gt;&gt; But that would track because the Bulls won how many? &gt;&gt; They won six. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he wasn&#x27;t there in the very He wasn&#x27;t there in the very early days. &gt;&gt; Maybe he won three and six. Yeah, Steve Kerr always gave me hope because like he&#x27;s we&#x27;re roughly the same height. So like it, you know, as a kid I was like, &quot;Yeah, I could still be an NBA champion. You know, he could shoot uh he could shoot three points. You could shoot</p>
<p>three-pointers.&quot; Yeah. Anyways, that was great. Check out Brad&#x27;s book, The Way of Excellence. Okay, so as mentioned, we&#x27;re now going to shift gears to our practice segment. So if the idea segment is ideas about the fight for depth in an attractive world, the practice segment is actual advice that you can consider in your own life for making that fight personal. Uh we&#x27;re going to shift gears from the world of ambition to the world of work. We got a good one. So uh let&#x27;s get started with our practices.

<h2>Escaping messaging hell</h2>
<p>year Microsoft puts out an annual study called the work trends index. Now, here&#x27;s what makes this study interesting is where they get their data from. One of their big sources of data points is the Microsoft 365 software suites like Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, you know, those tools that so many people use to work on their computers. They gather trillions of observations from people using that software. They anonymize them and analyze them and you get this snapshot of how are actual knowledge workers</p>
<p>using their computer. So they released their 2025 report sometime last year. Here I&#x27;ll load it up on the screen here uh for people to who are watching instead of just listening. I mean like typically these reports it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a thinly veiled blueprint for why you should use their products. But buried in there is always really good observations. Here are a couple numbers I pulled out of the 2025 report. The average worker in 2025 received 117 emails daily, most of them skimmed in under 60 seconds. Here&#x27;s another data point. The</p>
<p>average worker receives 153 Teams messages, that&#x27;s like Slack, Instant Messenger, per weekday. That adds up to 270 interruptions a day when you only have about 480 total minutes to work with. So when are people actually getting their work done if they&#x27;re being interrupted this much? Well, there is an insight in this question as well from the report. They found, and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll read here, over the weekend, usage of WXP, so Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint, the</p>
<p>non-communication tools, overtakes teams messages as employees finally carve out time for uninterrupted focus work. By the way, notice how all these people have they don&#x27;t want to use my term deep work. So, everyone uses the phrase focus work, which is, I guess, good or bad. Um they found perhaps not surprisingly that half of the employees that they they did a survey as well as part of this report. Half the employee survey described their jobs as quote chaotic and fragmented end quote. All right. So let me state the obvious here. I think these numbers are insane. Right?</p>
<p>You&#x27;re paying these knowledge workers huge amounts of money uh to essentially answer messages. I want you to spend all day answering emails or answering teams messages and then maybe on the weekend you can get a little bit of actual work done. This can&#x27;t possibly be the most cost-effective way of paying for a lot of human brains than asking them to create value. I&#x27;ve been talking about this problem for a long time, but what what kind of distresses me is that this issue of constant workplace distractions is getting worse. These are some of the worst numbers I&#x27;ve seen in the decade or so that I have studied this. So we need</p>
<p>good advice about how to push back against our current knowledge work culture of constant digital distractions. All right. So what I want to do is offer as this new year is still new. I want to go through um I&#x27;m going to go through my main ideas. I have one, two, three, four, five. I want to go through my five main ideas for how to tame the digital communication problem in your work. whether you work for a huge company or for yourself. And so here&#x27;s how I&#x27;m going to do it. I&#x27;ll load this on the screen for people who are uh watching</p>
<p>instead of just listening. I have five things here, one, two, three, four, five. Um I&#x27;m going to go through these one by one and uh give you my advice about them. All right? And hopefully this will help you prepare for the new year. So let&#x27;s start with the first idea was eliminate threads. So I&#x27;m going to bring up a couple bullet points about this. All right. So eliminate threads. What do I mean by that? Here is my explanation I put up on the screen. Anything that requires more than one message in response should be moved to synchronous communication. All right.</p>
<p>So, what do I mean by that? Think about all the different types of messages you receive in a typical day. Some of them are informational. This is the new parking lot&#x27;s going to be closed. The new policy for the cafeteria. All right, that&#x27;s one type of message. Another type of message is quick questions. Can you remind me what time the meeting is tomorrow? Right? The third category of communication you get in the workplace is going to be the beginning of a back and forth discussion. So when I say in my notes here, anything that requires more than one message in</p>
<p>response, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about. So communication threads where you ask a question, I have to answer, you have to get back to me, I have to get back to you. You&#x27;re basically taking a conversation and you&#x27;re spreading it out over back and forth messages, be them emails or instant messengers. Those type of threads are the main disruption interruption generator when it comes to digital communication. When it comes toformational things, email&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ll read this memo when I get around to it. That&#x27;s a perfect use of email. When it comes to questions that can be answered with a quick question, uh quick answer. That&#x27;s another great use of a tool like email because it can sit in my</p>
<p>inbox until I&#x27;m ready to answer it. I can answer it quickly and then it&#x27;s done. But when it comes to threads that require back and forth communication, this is what creates all the disruptions. Why? Because now we have a conversation going on. There is a time constraint to this conversation. We have to resolve it in a reasonable amount of time. Presumably, whatever conversation you started with that message, you do not want to unfold over the next 10 days. But in order for this back and forth conversation to be finished in a timely manner, we have to see each other&#x27;s latest message soon after it arrives.</p>
<p>So now I have to be checking whether it&#x27;s Teams or Slack or email, I have to be checking it constantly so that when your next message gets to me, I see it quick enough to bounce a message back to you and you see that quick enough to get back to me. And it&#x27;s that need to service back and forth digital conversations that takes the interruptions of things like email and chat and it metastasizes it until it&#x27;s all you&#x27;re doing all day long. So going back to my table here, my advice is to eliminate threads. So what I&#x27;m saying is anything that requires</p>
<p>more than one message and response, move to synchronous communication. That is real time communication. And there&#x27;s different ways you can do this. If you&#x27;re in an office, walk down the hallway and actually talk to the person or have office hours, which I talk about commonly, a set time each day where your door is open, your phone is on, you have a Zoom room open, and you can just say, &quot;Hey, um, come by my next office hours. will chat about this. That&#x27;s your one response when someone wants to start one of these back and forth threads. Or you can have a new concept which I&#x27;m introducing for 2026 which is the idea of a phone zone. I heard this from uh a</p>
<p>listener suggested this and I thought it was a great idea. You can have a much broader amount of time each day in which you can say uh I&#x27;m not dedicating this just to communicating but my phone&#x27;s going to be on. So a lot of people might say for example I don&#x27;t know 2 to 5 the end of my day I keep my phone on. So you can just call me at some point in that part of the afternoon. I don&#x27;t really schedule long deep work. Then I&#x27;m sort of like finishing things up. You can always just call me at some point in that broader zone and we&#x27;ll talk about this. You move things back to the phone. Synchronous when done this way is much more efficient than back and forth</p>
<p>communication because now what would have been 10 back and forth messages we could resolve in about four or five minutes of actually talking to each other. A word of warning here. Don&#x27;t allow your attraction to synchronicity mean that you create meetings. Now, that&#x27;s a problem. If I take what would have been 10 back and forth messages and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s just throw a Zoom meeting onto our schedule.&quot; Well, now I&#x27;ve just eaten up a half hour of time just for this one conversation, and that could be worse. One of the most uh the new and most distressing numbers I saw in this Microsoft trend uh study was that of the</p>
<p>meetings they were study so they they have all the meetings they can track meetings that happen on their meeting software 60% were quote ad hoc meaning that like someone that day was like hey let&#x27;s have a quick meeting to talk about it and then that puts a huge like 30 minute plus footprint on your schedule. So synchronous communication is good, but not when you need a full meeting to discuss something. You want to have be able to call you three minutes, you take care of it. You want someone to stop by your office during office hours, three or four minutes, you take care of it. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking for. All right, second idea. Let&#x27;s load this up here. Jesse, relocate for deep work. All right, let me put up my bullet point for</p>
<p>that. I&#x27;m going to make people motion sick with all my scrolling here. Jesse, protecting deep work on your calendar helps relocating to a different location without access to email and messaging is even better. So, I&#x27;ve talked about before the importance of when it comes to uninterrupted focus, you need to actually have that time put aside in advance. If you&#x27;re just waiting for when&#x27;s the next time when I have nothing to do and I feel like concentrating, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re waiting for to get your deep work done, you&#x27;re not going to do any deep work. You got to actually put aside the time, put on your calendar, schedule it like another</p>
<p>meeting or appointment and say, &quot;I don&#x27;t do email or or messaging during that period.&quot; So, you differentiate between times when you&#x27;re doing communication and times when you&#x27;re trying to make progress on things. And if people get mad at you, you say, &quot;I was working on the report. I don&#x27;t have my communication channels open when I&#x27;m working on my report.&quot; And stand by that. That&#x27;s a very reasonable thing. But what I&#x27;m arguing here, here&#x27;s my new for 2026 advice. It&#x27;s good to protect the time. It&#x27;s better to also have a location you go to that&#x27;s dedicated for that type of uninterrupted work. This really helps the mind lock into what</p>
<p>you&#x27;re doing. So, for example, if you can go to a place that does not have Wi-Fi or you can turn off your Wi-Fi as you go to like a conference room on another floor in your office and that&#x27;s where you go for the time you put aside to work on something that requires focus, it&#x27;s going to be so much easier because now you don&#x27;t have the option of quickly jumping on to your email or quickly jumping on to Teams or Slack because you literally don&#x27;t have the internet access you need to do that. And two, because it&#x27;s a separate location that you dedicate for doing deep work</p>
<p>type tasks, it&#x27;s much easier for your mind to understand that, oh, this is what we&#x27;re doing now. This is very different than if you do all of your work at the same desk, the same desk in which you do have to do email and you do have to jump on online meetings. If you&#x27;re also doing your deep work there, your mind can be very clever at saying, look, we spend a lot of time here checking email. Why not right now? And then you have to have that debate. But if you go to like the coffee shop, you go to the special conference room, you go to a a different part of town, you go to the special office you set up in your attic, when it comes time just to do deep work, your mind says, &quot;Oh, we know this. We know this drill. When we&#x27;re in</p>
<p>this location, we don&#x27;t do communication. And when we&#x27;re at our desk, we do.&quot; And so, don&#x27;t just protect deep work time, relocate, and make it logistically difficult to do communication in that location. This will really help you conquer the the communication problem as well. All right, we&#x27;re making progress here. Let&#x27;s jump on to number three. Load this up here. Batch group discussion. Um, I&#x27;m pushing here docket clearing meetings. And I say if you do this two or three times a week, you can eliminate 90% of group email threads and at least 50% of</p>
<p>one-off meetings. Those are two big promises. So, what are we talking about here? Well, docka clearing meetings, you can think of it as a collaborative office hours. Two or three times a week, your team gets together to say what uh what open loops, new tasks, new ideas, things we have to tackle have come up since our last docket clearing meeting. Let&#x27;s go through them all. Where do you find these? Well, you actually open up what I call a docket, but is actually just a shared document shared by the whole group. Whenever something comes up during your day that is relevant to the</p>
<p>group, a client asks a question, you have an idea, you hear about a new deadline coming up, there&#x27;s an RFP that you think maybe we should look at, you have a concern about an ongoing project, instead of immediately jumping to email and doing a group email to everyone, you write it into that shared document. That&#x27;s the docket. It grows as everyone in the team adds things to that that need to be discussed. Then at your next docket clearing meeting, you go through the things in that document together and for each you can defer it or you can delete it like this is not that important. Or you can say, &quot;Let&#x27;s actually work on this and figure out right there who&#x27;s going to do what?&quot;</p>
<p>That&#x27;s where you can be like, &quot;All right, Jesse, why don&#x27;t you handle this? What do you need from us?&quot; Okay, you need this information from Cal. All right, great. Uh, when&#x27;s he going to get it to you? By the close of business tomorrow. Great. So, Cal, you agree you&#x27;ll get that to him by close of business tomorrow. Uh, Jesse, when are you going to finish this thing? Okay, you&#x27;ll have it done by Thursday. Great. Put it in our shared drive. So, everyone else, let&#x27;s agree. On Friday, take a look at the document that Jesse put into the shared drive and put all your comments in there by the end of the day. You can figure out right there how to deal with the things so that you don&#x27;t</p>
<p>have to work that out with email. Because again, remember, if we have to figure that all out with email, that&#x27;s not just a lot of messages. It&#x27;s exponentially more inbox checks to try to keep up with those messages and to keep that that conversation going. All right. Well, that one leads us to my fourth suggestion, which is create processes. Now, I wrote here that you should spend more time in the moment to prevent many distractions down the line. I just gave you an example of the process uh process when I talked about our hypothetical about Jesse and that report. So, what was critical about what I just described</p>
<p>there? Well, it included, and I&#x27;ll highlight these, uh, who will deliver what, where they will put it, and when it will arrive. So, taking the time to talk with someone when a task comes up about who&#x27;s working on this, what is it that they&#x27;re going to produce, where will they put it when it&#x27;s done, when will it be there? You answer those questions, right? Four W&#x27;s. That saves a massive amount of communication because almost all of the emails that require us to keep checking</p>
<p>that inbox, almost all of the chats that pull out of our attention are figuring this out on the fly in an ad hoc manner and generating lots of distractions. People avoid creating a process for tasks because in the moment it requires a little bit more time and we want to just in the moment move through things and play inbox hot potato and just write thoughts question mark and hit send and now that&#x27;s off our plate. temporarily. That&#x27;s in the moment. We want to get these things out of our life. But if you spend a little bit more time to say what are we actually talking about here and what is our 4W plan for making progress</p>
<p>that structure is saving you interruption and interruptions are the productivity poison here. It is worth taking more time. It is worth taking more time. All right, we got one last suggestion. Reduce active projects. Each active project generates messages. Therefore, reducing active projects reduces messages. This is something I really came to understand when working on my last book, Slow Productivity. The connection between workload and messages. There is</p>
<p>a uh a certain amount of communication that any sort of active project will generate. I mean, I there&#x27;s logistics. I need to talk to people about things. We have to pass information around. If you increase the number of things you&#x27;re working on actively, you&#x27;re increasing the amount of this necessary communication that has to happen. It&#x27;s actually a major driver of of overload and communication is actually it&#x27;s overload in projects and the communication overload is a side effect of that deeper issue. We need to be working on less things at the same time. That is critical to reducing the amount of communication</p>
<p>that we have to deal with. And I think we miss that. Now, there&#x27;s a couple ways to do this. The obvious way to do this is to say no more often. If you&#x27;re in a situation where you can do that, like you&#x27;re an entrepreneur and you&#x27;re in charge of like what client projects you take on or whatever, just have a clear rule about how many you do at the same time. If you&#x27;re in a situation where saying no is hard, the key idea for my book, Slow Productivity, is to differentiate when it comes to things you&#x27;ve agreed to. differentiate between things that you are actively working on right now and things that are in a</p>
<p>holding pattern until you&#x27;re ready to work on them. Only be working on two or three things at once and everything else is on a list of I&#x27;m waiting to do. And any communication or meeting request or whatever that&#x27;s generated about things in the waiting pin, you say that is on hold right now. Uh I will let you know as soon as I actively start working on I estimate that&#x27;ll be in about two or three weeks and then we can start talking about and having meetings about it. But like right now it&#x27;s not one of my targets I&#x27;m working on. That works just as well because what we&#x27;re trying to avoid here is things too many things</p>
<p>generating messages and meetings. So in a holding pattern even though you&#x27;ve agreed to do it, it&#x27;s not generating message and meetings. So that that is okay. That can work as well. So I put a note about that on my table here where I said there&#x27;s a difference between saying no and putting something in a holding status. Both will give you the benefit. Uh but one is a little bit less severe than the other. All right. So, here are my five things. I&#x27;ll put the whole list zoomed out on the screen here. Eliminate. We got eliminate threads, relocate for deep work, batch group discussion, create processes, reduce</p>
<p>active projects. These five things will help you find a lot of freedom in 2026 from feeling like you&#x27;re constantly servicing communication channels. Here&#x27;s what I want you to notice about this advice, because I think this goes back to a lot of my advice about wrangling technology in the workplace. None of these are technological. None of these is advice about changing notification settings. None of this is advice about advanced filtering for your messages. None of this is about using more complicated software tools to try to compensate for the work that&#x27;s moving</p>
<p>back and forth uh through email. None of this is advice, God help us, for deploying, you know, AI and really complicated ways to try to uh summarize your messages. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s crazy, Jesse, how much it seems like companies working on AI productivity software thinks the number one issue facing people is taking email messages and summarizing them the bullet points. That&#x27;s not my problem. My problem is that I have 117 email messages to answer today. Emails by definition are already summaries of whatever the issue is, right? That&#x27;s not I know that&#x27;s what we know how to do, but that&#x27;s not what we actually have uh</p>
<p>problems doing. All of these are procedural structural uh scaffolding style solutions. Change your rules for what you communicate where. Have certain times for certain types of coordination versus other types of times. Have more processes. Be more careful about your workload. So we have this purely digital problem like low friction digital communications creating this overload. And our solutions are not adding more technology on top of that technology. is changing the underlying way we work so that we still get value out of that technology</p>
<p>but it&#x27;s not overwhelming us. So I just wanted to point that out that sometimes the problems created by technology aren&#x27;t solved by more complicated configurations of your technology but uh instead can come from having better processes or ways of thinking uh about your work. All right, so I&#x27;m going to load just one last little recommendation here. Um if you want to find out more about this, I wrote this book during the pandemic. I&#x27;m going to recommend it. Uh, it&#x27;s called A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload. As you&#x27;ll see, it was one of the best non-fiction books</p>
<p>of the year, Jesse, as selected by Amazon. It was also a New York Times bestselling book. This book is like my magnum opus on this question of where did the overload of communication come from? Why is it not making us productive? and what are I call them the protocols that uh you would put into place as an individual, a small team or a big organization to try to free yourself from communication overload. So listen to my advice. If you want to go deeper, check out a world without email. That book has a lot of big ideas. That</p>
<p>book kind of disappeared, Jesse, because it came out in the heart of the pandemic. Yep. &gt;&gt; And people were just &gt;&gt; not at that moment saying, you know what my number one concern is right now? uh our meeting structure or like my I really want to work on my my email habits or whatever, you know, that wasn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t the top of mind at the time. So, um I&#x27;m telling people about it now. Check out that book. All right, I think that&#x27;s it for our practice segment. Jesse, I think we&#x27;ll move on now to question and comments. All right, we got one question this</p>
<p>week. Is that right? We&#x27;re doing something a little bit different. One question that&#x27;s going to take up a lot of our time. Let&#x27;s hear it. Everyone keeps talking about how AI has suddenly changed everything, but outside of computer programmers, most of the</p>
<h2>Have new AI tools actually been as transformative as claimed?</h2>
<p>examples I hear of people using new AI tools are pretty narrow and niche. Am I missing something? I uh I like this question. I think uh it gets to something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot recently that&#x27;s maybe like a dangerous thought, but it&#x27;s worth us actually exploring a little bit here. Clearly, a huge amount of money is being invested into new generative AI tools built on large language models such as chatbots. And it&#x27;s just goes without saying this has been massively disruptive. Most of the conversation is about how do we deal</p>
<p>with the disruption that has been caused by this new technology. But think about this question for a second. What actually are the things that this massive investment in generative AI through language models, what actually are the things that this has changed? Because if you ask people, they don&#x27;t always have an immediate answer to offer up. Is that possible? Well, I want to investigate this. So, here&#x27;s the way I&#x27;m going to do this. Um, I found a Reddit thread that was from three months ago. I&#x27;ll put this on the screen here for</p>
<p>people who are watching. It says the same question. with all the billions or trillions going into it, what has AI actually done other than as a search engine and funny pictures. So, this is a thread where people from all over the internet are going to write in and do their best to explain all the various things that we&#x27;ve gotten from this massive investment in new AI technologies. So, whatever these benefits are, you would think they&#x27;re in this very popular thread. So, what we&#x27;re going to do is I want to go through this Reddit thread to try to come up with uh a list of the</p>
<p>things that this recent massive invest in AI has produced. Now, a couple ground rules to this. I&#x27;m not going to include things uh AI applications. I&#x27;m not going to include AI applications that are based um aren&#x27;t based primarily on the new large language models that have received the bulk of this investment. So the type of models that OpenAI and Enthropic have been producing, there&#x27;s a lot of existing machine learning driven AI tools that we&#x27;ve been working on for year after year and and over the time those have made progress. I&#x27;m going to separate that because that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s</p>
<p>just the standard progress in AI and it&#x27;s not connected to anything new that has happened. I also want to separate into its own category the one obvious place where we hear most often about language models making an impact which is computer programming. Computer programming is like a best case scenario for gender of AI. It&#x27;s a highly structured language and we have a huge amount of very uh relevant data on which to train these. So we know it&#x27;s been really uh impactful there. So we&#x27;ll kind of keep that as its own column. What I&#x27;m looking for as we go through here then what I&#x27;m actually going to write down as we go through here is examples that depend on the generative AI models that</p>
<p>we put billions of dollars in the last three or four years. But it&#x27;s not computer programming because clearly if this has really changed our world that list should be really long. All right. So I&#x27;m going to load this back up again. Um, and I&#x27;m going to go through I this is a very long thread, so I&#x27;m just going to pull do the best I can to go through this. All right, so the first thing we see here is assisting medical and scientific research and translating ancient documents written in dead languages. Um, none of the neither of those are really from generative AI assisting medical and scientific research. I mean, there are a lot of tools that we&#x27;re using in for</p>
<p>medical research. We&#x27;re building AI tools, but that&#x27;s using existing technology that that&#x27;s been around pre uh the Gen AI boom. um translation documents. That&#x27;s also machine learning tools have been around. We&#x27;ve been getting better at them, but that&#x27;s not directly related to the recent boom. All right, let&#x27;s keep going here. Um AI as a tool is incredible at very specific things, mostly things human finds to be incredibly mind-numbing and meticulous. Uh its best use by far is pattern finding in wide data sets that are hard to pick up by hand. So, I&#x27;m going to put that down. Pattern finding, I&#x27;m just writing this on paper here. So, pattern</p>
<p>finding, I I&#x27;ve heard this. You can give some data to a chatbot and it can perhaps find you some patterns. Um, let&#x27;s keep going. Alphafold protein structure database. Uh, Alphafold is not based off of directly based off of the recent investments in Generative AI. They&#x27;ve been working on that model for well before the LLM breakthrough when it uses um its own technologies that have it has some new versions have some overlap with transformer attention ideas. But that is sort of a separate trajectory. That&#x27;s not a result of the billions and billions that have been invested in large language models. So,</p>
<p>um I&#x27;m going to put that to the side. All right. Next thing. It speeds up a lot of menial computer task. I had it make a PowerPoint from six MSWordsized document pages for me. It made 60 slides like a minute. Would have taken me an hour to do the same thing. I&#x27;m going to write that down. Like I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll put down slide production. Uh it&#x27;s more generally it can produce slides. Uh, I&#x27;ve seen that in PowerPoint. That&#x27;s a good that and that that required the investments that have happened. So, we&#x27;ll put that down. Um, let&#x27;s see. It&#x27;s incredible tool for programming. Okay, so we&#x27;re putting that</p>
<p>aside. There&#x27;s an argument about that. Someone else says it&#x27;s a lot of bad code and then all the cloud code. People come out with their their torches and get mad at them. Um, here&#x27;s a different one. I mean, it really is useful for quickly disseminating a large volume of boring info into bite-sized pieces and identifying points of interest. I think this is right. So, I&#x27;m going to put down summarizing text. So, we&#x27;ve seen this a lot. Like, you can take a a bunch of notes, like a meeting transcript, and say, &quot;Let&#x27;s let&#x27;s give me the give me the main points here. Summarize this in the bullet points.&quot; Um, language model is very good at that.</p>
<p>All right, let&#x27;s keep rolling here. Translation of any language to another. That&#x27;s not primarily a language model based thing. We&#x27;ve been doing that for a while. It&#x27;s being used to help detect cancer earlier than humans detect it. All of that sort of medical prediction model research is not those are not underlying it language models. That&#x27;s something people have been working on for decades and we keep getting a little bit better at it. But that&#x27;s sort of unrelated to the billions being invested in large language models. So I&#x27;ll put that aside. Um discussion discussion mapped every protein. We talked about that. That&#x27;s not large language models. Let&#x27;s uh keep moving here. Someone else</p>
<p>described a bunch of stuff and then a response to that said most of this stuff you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t break us from the last three years. a slow incremental process over the last 20 or more years. Um, that&#x27;s right. So, he was pointing out a whole long example of things that uh was not actually generative AI. Someone says take customer support. Call centers are already so heavily scripted they might as well be AI. Make AI good enough to hold a rudimentary guided conversation and it can replace basically every first level support person. That&#x27;s some speculation into the future, but I will put down uh customer support agents because there are more of</p>
<p>those. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily replacing the industry as quickly as people predicted, but there are better sort of firstline chat agents that language models in particular made those good enough to deploy in a way that they wouldn&#x27;t have been before. All right, let&#x27;s go here. Um, a teacher in my family uses it to create a live avatar of himself that speaks fluently in multiple different languages as it records him teach in his native language. She&#x27;s been able to teach multiple classes in multiple countries at the same time. I guess that&#x27;s partially language models are probably</p>
<p>involved in that. Uh the language translation is something we&#x27;ve been doing from before. In the medical field, AI does a decent job transcribing notes. It&#x27;s not really a generative AI breakthrough though OpenAI has been working on voice to text. They have a special model for that, their sort of whisper model which they then have on the front end of chat GBT. So like if you talk to your phone into the chat GPT app app, you really have a separate smaller model that&#x27;s been trained. It&#x27;s a different type of architecture than a language model that converts that to text and then the text is submitted to the large language models. So that&#x27;s</p>
<p>cool, but again that is not a result of the billions invested in large language models. We were already doing that. Um then someone came along, this is interesting, and said you can do things like tell it read this congressional bill and note anything that seems illegal, unconstitutional, or would adversely affect separation of powers, checks and balances or civil liberties ranked by risk. Then describe the worst case scenario, the worst possible abuse of the change considering an executive branch intent on consolidating power for itself. And the guy&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s the type of thing you could you could ask GPT5 to do.&quot; But then someone else wrote back and said, &quot;LM can&#x27;t actually do that though, right? There&#x27;s no</p>
<p>reason, no imagination. They can&#x27;t create and explore scenarios in the way you&#x27;re explaining. They&#x27;re not going to give you good advice. So, I&#x27;m not going to write anything down. Someone else said, &quot;Check this year&#x27;s Nobel Prize in chemistry.&quot; Well, that was given to Deep Mind for AlphaFold, which again is non- language model technology that predates the billions invested. Someone else says it can make pretty good uh hint. And someone else said actually it&#x27;s slop. So, I guess I won&#x27;t write that down. Someone else said, &quot;Write the answers to my stupid quarterly self-review questions.&quot; That is true. write boring text. Yeah. So, it is really good</p>
<p>for that. Like, oh my god, no one cares about this. I have to write a self-review. It&#x27;ll write boring, you know, good enough text that covers what you want. It&#x27;s very good at that. All right. Uh, let&#x27;s just do a couple more because I think we&#x27;re seeing some patterns here. Someone else says there&#x27;s thousands of AI projects you don&#x27;t hear about because they&#x27;re corporate trade secrets. That&#x27;s not true. Uh, there&#x27;s a lot of that push of like, no, there&#x27;s all these amazing things you just don&#x27;t know about yet. They&#x27;re coming. Let me tell you, as someone who&#x27;s studied this for the last five years, they&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve always been quote unquote three months away from learning about the amazing thing that OpenAI or Anthropic or Google</p>
<p>or Microsoft are doing behind the scenes. I have a lot of sources at these places. There aren&#x27;t magic projects. There isn&#x27;t. I mean, we heard this two years ago that OpenAI had AI was now doing all their programming and within a few months they&#x27;re going to start like leaping ahead in models completely made by AI. That was just made up. It&#x27;s just not true. They&#x27;re using the same coding agents that anyone else is using. So, uh, I get that. Um, we&#x27;ll do one or two more small QL improvements for businesses, automatically sending text messages to confirm appointments a few days prior, things like that. Sure, you can call it AI, but none of that has to do with</p>
<p>advances in language models that have taken all these billions of uh, investments. And then someone says, uh, fake videos and influencers pushing fascism. There is a lot of fake videos. That&#x27;s not a good thing though. That&#x27;s a bad thing. Um, and then I saw something else in here. I&#x27;ll just write this down because I can&#x27;t quite find it, but basically someone was talking about it&#x27;s good for pulling out or summarizing complicated information. And they talked about taking the municipal parking rules for where they lived and then chat GPT could kind of summarize them into</p>
<p>something that&#x27;s easier. So, make sense of complicated text. All right, whatever. We&#x27;ve been going for a while here, right? Let me look at this list I just wrote. So this is, you know, AI is a the world is going to be unrecognizable. It&#x27;s the biggest thing that&#x27;s ever happened to us. How why are our kids even going to college? Like this is where we are now. Here is the list of things from this open discussion on the internet. Anyone who can come and tell us how the billions invested recently AI have changed the world. Here is the the total list of non-computer programming uh ideas that came out of this. Pattern</p>
<p>finding, producing slides, summarizing text in the bullet points, customer service agents, writing uh boring text automatically, and helping to make sense of complicated text. Those are cool, Jesse. But if I just if I five years ago said, imagine a tool that could do those six things. you weren&#x27;t gonna like Simpson style crash out of the window and then like jump on the back of a horse and ride off. It&#x27;s like oh that&#x27;s yeah it sounds like that good. I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re making progress on</p>
<p>that. So it&#x27;s kind of interesting and look I don&#x27;t want to go too far here and be like this revolution doesn&#x27;t matter. But when you put aside the computer programming stuff which is a discussion for another time it&#x27;s complicated more complicated than people make it out to be but that&#x27;s a discussion for another time. And when you put aside other AI stuff that&#x27;s unrelated to all these billions we invested, what we are getting right now out of the whatever it is $500 billion that have been invested uh into Generative AI, there&#x27;s not a ton of home runs yet. And I think this is an a a difficult point</p>
<p>for AI boosters is why there&#x27;s a lot of like what is going to happen next year? And we&#x27;ve done this five years in a row now almost. What is going to happen next year is where the conversation goes because I think it&#x27;s hard not to admit the real concrete things are coming a little slower than we think. Now there we we see these amazing demos. We see these things do great on benchmarks and we have all these scary scenarios which are real like look at these fake videos. What&#x27;s going to happen to truth or students can produce their papers on these things? But if we really think about it the stuff that like what&#x27;s changing your mind people are using this</p>
<p>like a better version of Google and then they&#x27;re very narrow right now. Now, this doesn&#x27;t mean much bigger changes aren&#x27;t coming, but I thought this was an interesting sort of experiment to do that when we actually look at what has already come specifically from investing all of this money into gener. It&#x27;s hard not to conclude that like so far um it&#x27;s not massive yet. I don&#x27;t think people realize that until you actually start trying to answer that question of what have we gotten so far.</p>
<p>So, I don&#x27;t know, Jesse. Everyone thinks I&#x27;m being too conservative on AI, and I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not a really big deal, but it you would think that thread would have a lot more like, oh my god, that did change everything. I mean, if we did that same post on the internet in like the year 2001, it would be like, the yellow pages don&#x27;t exist anymore. You can get direct information about like every company that exists. You can communicate with anyone on Earth for free and you can buy things without having to go to a store and like see it in like these are huge things. Those are huge things and you</p>
<p>don&#x27;t necessarily have to drive your car. You &gt;&gt; don&#x27;t have to drive your car. That&#x27;s that is a bigger scale than producing slides or summarizing text, right? So like we&#x27;re not if we put this in scale, I know big changes are coming and it&#x27;s all very scary, but it hasn&#x27;t yet. We&#x27;re going to get a lot of angry emails about that one, but that&#x27;s fine. You can send them all to Jesse and he&#x27;ll he&#x27;ll summarize them for me. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll pass him on to Ed Zitron. &gt;&gt; Ed Zitron. Yeah. There we go. Let&#x27;s get in here. Let&#x27;s have him do a rant. People like Ed. He&#x27;s very polarizing. That&#x27;s what makes him a good guest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um All right. We got a couple comments to respond to as well. We try</p>
<p>to respond to some of the comments for our most recent uh episodes. I haven&#x27;t seen these yet. So, here we go. We&#x27;re load them up on the screen. These are comments. What? From YouTube, Jesse.</p>
<h2>Cal responds to comments</h2>
<p>from the YouTube version of last week&#x27;s episode which was on the things that are worrying John height now um after the anxious generation. All right. So the first comment we have here comes from Stephvens 2 who says I don&#x27;t have children but if I ever did I would be so nervous about giving them any tech beyond a brick phone from the &#x27;9s. That&#x27;s not a bad instinct. I mean this was the the whole point of the practices segment last week. singlepurpose technology has a lot of advantages because you can control and curate it much more effectively than putting</p>
<p>everything on the one device that you package together. So yeah, brick phone is great. I mean, as we mentioned, we have a landline at our house for our kids and a a pushb button cell phone that they can bring with them if they need to be able to communicate with us. the what I wish existed. Here&#x27;s my company, Jesse. A a a dumb phone that looks exactly like the phone Michael Douglas uses in the movie Wall Street. &gt;&gt; I remember that phone. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this idea. So, if I tell my kids like, &quot;All right, you can bring a phone with you.&quot; They&#x27;re like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And then you give them what it is. Like,</p>
<p>oh, I bet you I bet that company would do well. A Michael Douglas style brick phone. I just see kids everywhere having to like call call their parents on it. I love that idea. Um, is that our only comment? Let&#x27;s see. Oh, I see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I loaded one. All right. Here&#x27;s another. See if I can figure out computers. All right. Uh, this one is from Andre Valdez. Every year, I&#x27;m more convinced the Amish got it right. I&#x27;m with you, Andre. I mean, I wrote about the Amish in my</p>
<p>book, Digital Minimalism. Uh, as everyone always reminds me when I talk about the Amish, they have their own issues and the way they run their society. But the one thing I do think they do well is their general approach to technology. People often get this wrong. People think that the Amish&#x27;s approach to technology was we will freeze technology in the year 1874 and won&#x27;t use any technologies after that. Like that they&#x27;re somehow like they they decided that there was some perfect year and they just froze time there and said we&#x27;re not going to go forward. That&#x27;s not what the Amish do. Instead, they have a rigorous</p>
<p>methodology for how do they consider each new technology that they might potentially use as a community. So, when a new technology comes along that might be relevant, they will often have one or two people, Kevin Kelly calls this like alpha users go out and try the technology and they observe what is the impact of this on them, on their life, and on their connection to the community. And if the benefits are clear and the harms are small, then like they&#x27;ll go ahead and use that technology. But if the harms seem big compared to the benefits, they&#x27;ll say, &quot;Okay, we will now decree as a community, we are not going to use that</p>
<p>technology.&quot; So they actually run new technologies through a valuebased system for evaluating whether they&#x27;re useful or not. So there&#x27;s actually like a lot of technology in modern technology in Amish worlds. Like they&#x27;ll use modern diapers, for example. There&#x27;s no particular harm to using a modern diaper and it has huge amounts of advantages, right? Um, or you&#x27;ll see Amish rollerblading because it&#x27;s, you know, they can get between places, you know, quicker and it&#x27;s kind of fun and it doesn&#x27;t hurt it, but they&#x27;re not going to use a car because they realized when they brought in cars, people left the community all together to go do other things and that was bad</p>
<p>for community uh cohesion. They might have a phone that everyone uses, but they don&#x27;t use smartphones typically, and again, this is community by community, but most communities don&#x27;t use smartphones because when people had their individual phones, they had less need to come together and that hurt community cohesion. So the lesson from the Amish is not to follow their particular decisions, but to follow their methodology and be willing to say convenience is not my number one goal. Functionality is not my number one goal. Living a life true to my values is. And</p>
<p>that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m going to evaluate technology. And yeah, sure, it&#x27;s a pain that I can&#x27;t use a car, but I&#x27;m not trying to avoid things that are a pain. I&#x27;m trying to emphasize the things that are a joy. And that is community living. So living your life true to values. That&#x27;s what the Amish pointed out. My book digital minimalism basically lays out a whole approach to doing that with your own technology in your own life. So yeah, the Amish are on to something. Uh we got one more here. This one is from Slav Marovic who says in 2026 the one who will win is not the one who has quote better tools in quotes but the</p>
<p>one who has better boundaries short relief now an expensive price in the future. The smartest strategy is to remove unnecessary access points. That&#x27;s why the idea of a landline phone is not nostalgia but environmental engineering. Freedom begins when there are default limits. I think that goes to what we were just saying about the Amish. I think it&#x27;s a smart idea. What are your constraints? And if you don&#x27;t have constraints, then someone else is controlling your experience of your life. I I this is a common idea. This is going to be weird connection, Jesse, but this is a common idea in the world of uh financial planning, right? When it comes to your</p>
<p>personal finances, there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a common idea there that says if there&#x27;s nothing you ever say no to that you want to do and spend money on, if there&#x27;s nothing you can say, I wanted to do this, but I didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t spend money on this, then you don&#x27;t have a budget. Doesn&#x27;t matter how many things you track or how many things you write down. If you&#x27;re not actually at some point saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do that even though I want to,&quot; you don&#x27;t really have a budget. You just have spreadsheets. Well, I think the same thing is true for technology. If you don&#x27;t have constraints that are based on your values that are important to you, that lead you at least occasionally to not</p>
<p>use or use less frequently a technology that would be useful or interesting or entertaining in the moment, then you have no coherent philosophy for technology in your life. And you&#x27;re letting not just the technologies, but more accurately the technology companies take control of your marionette strings. That&#x27;s what happens if you don&#x27;t have rules. You&#x27;re basically now toiling in Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s attention factory. You&#x27;re you&#x27;re your life is serving the major stockholders of like the the fang companies, like six different</p>
<p>companies that like a lot of your day now is dedicated to helping Mark Zuckerberg buy the second half of Kawaii. So if there&#x27;s nothing you say no to that what might be interesting or useful or is popular, you don&#x27;t have a technology philosophy. That means you&#x27;re an unpaid employee of the technology company. So I like this idea. What are your constraints? and they&#x27;ll be different from person to person. But if you don&#x27;t have clear constraints, then you&#x27;re not in charge of your life. You&#x27;re letting the technology companies be there. And I think more and more people are fed up with that that reality. So, I appreciate that comment. All right, that&#x27;s all the time we have for comments. Uh, I like to end each</p>
<p>episode just bringing people up to speed with what I&#x27;m reading. I finished two</p>
<h2>Cal gives his weekly reading update</h2>
<p>books last week, Jesse. They&#x27;re both weird. I I was So, here&#x27;s Let me say this about reading. You gota You gotta admit this, Jesse. Um, a lot of people, this a problem I don&#x27;t have. A lot of people use public declarations of what they&#x27;re reading to signal positive things about themselves. Not me. I I want to present a realistic I read for interest. I read for information, but I read for stress relief. I read for I need to, you know, escape. I read weird stuff. And this week, I think, is a good example of that. So, what I was, you</p>
<p>know, I had some stuff going on with stress. I was like, I need to get my mind off of work. I don&#x27;t want to be reading about technology or complicated history. So, uh, two random books. One, Future Boy by Michael J. Fox, which actually actually pretty interesting. You know, I like movie stuff, right? So, it was about the making of Back to the Future. &gt;&gt; I listen to it because Michael J. Fox narrates it. &gt;&gt; Um, but I this is one of my things I go to when I&#x27;m stressed is cinema books because it&#x27;s a world that&#x27;s so different from mine and I love movies. It&#x27;s just like I can be escape into there. &gt;&gt; And you&#x27;re pretty much reading a cinema</p>
<p>book every month anyway, right? &gt;&gt; I read a bunch of cinema. It I mean it just depends on my stress. Okay. Then the next thing I read, this is where I really go when I&#x27;m stressed. Um I read Jeff Baham&#x27;s unauthorized history of Disneyland&#x27;s Haunted Mansion dark ride. Dark ride stuff. That&#x27;s like my romance novel, you know? Like how did they just engineering? You&#x27;re sitting in like an Imagineering room like figuring out different like effects and ride capacities. so separate from my life that like that is my I remember I was like stressed out. I was</p>
<p>like I&#x27;m going to read this book and it was great and I enjoyed it. &gt;&gt; So going into the month so now I couple things. One, you&#x27;re doing updates pretty much every episode now about what you&#x27;re reading. &gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of in real time. &gt;&gt; And then secondly, say you had your books for January. Was this one of them or you were stressed and you pulled another one? &gt;&gt; Oh, I don&#x27;t know. I kind of just figure out what I want to read next. Right. So like right now the things I&#x27;m reading are um more intellectual because I&#x27;m I that moment passed. &gt;&gt; Okay, I guess that makes sense. &gt;&gt; So I probably pushed those I pushed those aside. Maybe I delayed them. I But</p>
<p>actually one of the books I&#x27;m reading now um it&#x27;s a more like an academic book. I guess I kind of knew about it but I started and then another one is coming today. I just ordered a tech a tech criticism book that I missed last year and it was a big deal and so I am excited to read that. Uh but last week I was that&#x27;s not where I was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And plus you finish a book, you know, weekly so you can easily just pick something else if you&#x27;re stressed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But like the point I want to emphasize is, you know, reading doesn&#x27;t have to be about I want this to look good when I post it on whatever,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; you know, good reason. &gt;&gt; We don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t have a lot of good models for that. I mean, I I think there&#x27;s like two approach to reading. There&#x27;s like the novel approach to reading where it&#x27;s like I just all I do is read novels and I want to read the the good new novels and those novelists make a lot of money because there&#x27;s a lot of people who read novels. and this novel was good, this was less good. And that&#x27;s one approach to reading, but for non-fiction readers, there&#x27;s not a lot of models. Um, to read diversely in non-fiction, we don&#x27;t hear a lot about this. And so, you know, I try to keep that open. All right, so that&#x27;s all the time we have for today. Thank you for listening. We&#x27;ll be back next week with another episode. And until then, as</p>
<p>always, stay deep. Hey, if you like today&#x27;s discussion about ambition and the internet, you might also like episode 384 where I talked about a collection of books you could read to help inspire you to have a deeper, more ambitious new year. Check it out. I think you&#x27;ll like it. And I pulled six books off the shelf that I all think have been uh played an important role in my own development and my own quest for a deep life. And I want to briefly talk about</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Is AI a disappointment?</h2>
<p>Clearly, a huge amount of money is being invested into new generative AI tools built on large language models such as chatbots. And it&#x27;s just goes without saying this has been massively disruptive. Most of the conversation is about how do we deal with the disruption that has been caused by this new technology. But think about this question for a second. What actually are the things that this massive investment in generative AI through language models, what actually are the things that this has changed? Because if you ask people, they don&#x27;t</p>
<p>always have an immediate answer to offer up. Is that possible? Well, I want to investigate this. So, here&#x27;s the way I&#x27;m going to do this. Um, I found a Reddit thread that was from three months ago. I&#x27;ll put this on the screen here for people who are watching. It says the same question. with all the billions or trillions going into it, what has AI actually done other than as a search engine and funny pictures. So, this is a thread where people from all over the internet are going to write in and do their best to explain all the various things that we&#x27;ve gotten from this</p>
<p>massive investment in new AI technologies. So, whatever these benefits are, you would think they&#x27;re in this very popular thread. So, what we&#x27;re going to do is I want to go through this Reddit thread to try to come up with uh a list of the things that this recent massive invest in AI has produced. Now, a couple ground rules to this. I&#x27;m not going to include things uh AI applications. I&#x27;m not going to include AI applications that are based um aren&#x27;t based primarily on the new large language models that have received the</p>
<p>bulk of this investment. So the type of models that OpenAI and Enthropic have been producing there&#x27;s a lot of existing machine learning driven AI tools that we&#x27;ve been working on for year after year and and over the time those have made progress. I&#x27;m going to separate that because that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s just the standard progress in AI and it&#x27;s not connected to anything new that has happened. I also want to separate into its own category the one obvious place where we hear most often about language models making an impact which is computer programming. Computer programming is like a best case scenario for gender of AI. It&#x27;s a highly structured language and we have a huge</p>
<p>amount of very uh relevant data on which to train these. So we know it&#x27;s been really uh impactful there. So we&#x27;ll kind of keep that as its own column. What I&#x27;m looking for as we go through here then what I&#x27;m actually going to write down as we go through here is examples that depend on the generative AI models that we put billions of dollars in the last three or four years. But it&#x27;s not computer programming because clearly if this has really changed our world that list should be really long. All right. So I&#x27;m going to load this back up again. Um, and I&#x27;m going to go through I this is a very long thread, so I&#x27;m just going to pull do the best I can to go through this. All right, so the first thing we see</p>
<p>here is assisting medical and scientific research and translating ancient documents written in dead languages. Um, none of the neither of those are really from generative AI assisting medical and scientific research. I mean, there are a lot of tools that we&#x27;re using in for medical research. We&#x27;re building AI tools, but that&#x27;s using existing technology that that&#x27;s been around pre uh the Gen AI boom. Um translation documents, that&#x27;s also machine learning tools have been around. We&#x27;ve been getting better at them, but that&#x27;s not directly related to the recent boom. All right, let&#x27;s keep going here. Um AI as a</p>
<h2>Pattern finding</h2>
<p>tool is incredible at very specific things, mostly things human finds to be incredibly mind-numbing and meticulous. Uh its best use by far is pattern finding in wide data sets that are hard to pick up by hand. So, I&#x27;m going to put that down. Pattern finding. I&#x27;m just writing this on paper here. So, pattern finding. I I&#x27;ve heard this. You can give some data to a chatbot and it can perhaps find you some patterns. Um, let&#x27;s keep going. Alphafold protein structure database. Uh, Alphafold is not based off of directly based off of the recent investments in Generative AI.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve been working on that model for well before the LLM breakthrough when it uses um its own technologies that have it has some new versions have some overlap with transformer attention ideas but that is sort of a separate trajectory that&#x27;s not a result of the billions and billions that have been invested in large language models. So um I&#x27;m going to put that to the side. All right. Next thing it speeds up a lot of menial computer task. I had it make a PowerPoint from six MSWordsiz document pages for me. It made 60 slides like a minute. Would have taken me an hour to do the same thing. I&#x27;m going to write that down. Like I I&#x27;ll put down slide</p>
<p>production. Uh it&#x27;s more generally it can produce slides. Uh I&#x27;ve seen that in PowerPoint. That&#x27;s a good that required the investments that have happened. So we&#x27;ll put that down. Um let&#x27;s see. It&#x27;s incredible tool for programming. Okay, so we&#x27;re putting that aside. There&#x27;s an argument about that. Someone else says it&#x27;s a lot of bad code and then all the cloud code people come out with their their torches and get mad at them. Um here&#x27;s a different one. I mean, it really is useful for quickly disseminating a large volume of boring info into bite-sized pieces and identifying points of interest. I think</p>
<p>this is right. So, I&#x27;m going to put down summarizing text. So, we&#x27;ve seen this a lot. Like, you can take a a bunch of notes like a meeting transcript and say, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s give me the give me the main points here. Summarize this in the bullet points. Um, language is very good at that. All right, let&#x27;s keep rolling here. Translation of any language to another. That&#x27;s not primarily a language model based thing. We&#x27;ve been doing that for a while. It&#x27;s being used to help detect cancer earlier than humans detect it. All of that sort of medical prediction model research is not those are not underlying it language models. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>something people have been working on for decades and we keep getting a little bit better at it. But that&#x27;s sort of unrelated to the billions being invested in large language models. So I&#x27;ll put that aside. Um discussion discussion mapped every protein. We talked about that. That&#x27;s not large language models. Let&#x27;s uh keep moving here. Someone else described a bunch of stuff and then a response to that said most of the stuff you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t breakthroughs from the last three years a slow incremental process over the last 20 or more years. Um that&#x27;s right. So he was pointing out a whole long example of things that uh was not actually generative AI. Someone says take</p>
<p>customer support. Call centers are</p>
<h2>AI and customer support</h2>
<p>already so heavily scripted they might as well be AI. Make AI good enough to hold a rudimentary guided conversation and it can replace basically every first level support person. That&#x27;s some speculation into the future, but I will put down uh customer support agents because there are more of those. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily replacing the industry as quickly as people predicted, but there are better sort of firstline chat agents that language models in particular made those good enough to deploy in a way that they wouldn&#x27;t have been before. All right, let&#x27;s go here. Um, a teacher in my family uses it to</p>
<p>create a live avatar of himself that speaks fluently in multiple different languages as it records him teach in his native language. He&#x27;s been able to teach multiple classes in multiple countries at the same time. I guess that&#x27;s partially language models are probably involved in that. Uh, the language translation is something we&#x27;ve been doing from before. In the medical field, AI does a decent job transcribing notes. It&#x27;s not really a generative AI breakthrough though OpenAI has been working on voice to text. They have a special model for that, their sort of whisper model which they then have on the front end of chat GPT. So like if</p>
<p>you talk to your phone into the chat GPT act app, you really have a separate smaller model that&#x27;s been trained. It&#x27;s a different type of architecture than a language model that converts that to text and then the text is submitted to the large language model. So that&#x27;s cool, but again that is not a result of the billions invested in large language models. We were already doing that. Um then someone came along, this is interesting, and said you can do things like tell it read this congressional bill and note anything that seems illegal, unconstitutional, or would adversely affect separation of powers, checks and balances or civil liberties ranked by risk and describe the worst</p>
<p>case scenario, the worst possible abuse of the change considering an executive branch intent on consolidating power for itself. And the guy&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s the type of thing you could you could ask GPT5 to do.&quot; But then someone else wrote back and said, &quot;LMs can&#x27;t actually do that, though, right? There&#x27;s no reason, no imagination. they can&#x27;t create and explore scenarios in the way you&#x27;re explaining. They&#x27;re not going to give you good advice. So, I&#x27;m not going to write anything down. Someone else said, &quot;Check this year&#x27;s Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&quot; Well, that was given to Deep Mind for AlphaFold, which again is non- language model technology that predates the billions invested. Someone else says, &quot;It can make pretty</p>
<p>good uh hint.&quot; And someone else said, &quot;Actually, it&#x27;s slop.&quot; So, I guess I won&#x27;t write that down. Someone else said, &quot;Write the answers to my stupid quarterly self-review questions.&quot; That is true, right? boring text. Yeah. So, it is really good for that. Like, oh my god, no one cares about this. I have to write a self-re. It&#x27;ll write boring, you know, good enough text that covers what you want. It&#x27;s very good at that. All right. Uh, let&#x27;s just do a couple more because I</p>
<h2>Corporate trade secrets</h2>
<p>think we&#x27;re seeing some patterns here. Someone else says there&#x27;s thousands of AI projects you don&#x27;t hear about because they&#x27;re corporate trade secrets. That&#x27;s not true. Uh, there&#x27;s a lot of that push of like, no, there&#x27;s all these amazing things you just don&#x27;t know about yet. They&#x27;re coming. Let me tell you, as someone who&#x27;s studied this for the last five years, they&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve always been quote unquote three months away from learning about the amazing thing that Open AAI or Anthropic or Google or Microsoft are doing behind the scenes. I have a lot of sources at these places. There aren&#x27;t magic projects. There isn&#x27;t. I mean, we heard this two years ago that OpenAI had AI was now doing all their programming and within a few</p>
<p>months they&#x27;re going to start like leaping ahead in models completely made by AI. That was just made up. It&#x27;s just not true. They&#x27;re using the same coding agents that anyone else is using. So, uh, I get that. Um, we&#x27;ll do one or two more small QL improvements for businesses, automatically sending text messages to confirm appointments a few days prior, things like that. Sure, you can call it AI, but none of that has to do with advances in language models that have taken all these billions of uh, investments. And then someone says, uh, fake videos and influencers pushing fascism. There</p>
<p>is a lot of fake videos. That&#x27;s not a good thing though. That&#x27;s a bad thing. Um, and then I saw something else in here. I&#x27;ll just write this down because I can&#x27;t quite find it, but basically someone was talking about it&#x27;s good for pulling out or summarizing complicated information and they talked about taking the municipal parking rules for where they lived and then chat GPT could kind of summarize them into something that&#x27;s easier. So, make sense of complicated text. All right, whatever. We&#x27;ve been going for a while here, right? Let me look at this list I just wrote.</p>
<p>So this is, you know, AI is a the world is going to be unrecognizable. It&#x27;s the biggest thing that&#x27;s ever happened to us. How why are our kids even going to college? Like this is where we are now. Here is the list of things from this open discussion on the internet. Anyone who can come and tell us how the billions invested recently AI have changed the world. Here is the the total list of non-computer programming uh ideas that came out of this pattern finding, producing slides, summarizing text in the bullet points, customer service agents,</p>
<p>writing uh boring text automatically, and helping to make sense of complicated text. Those are cool, Jesse. But if I just if I five years ago said, imagine a tool that could do those six things. you weren&#x27;t going to like Simpson style crash out of the window and then like jump on the back of a horse and ride off. It&#x27;s like oh that&#x27;s yeah it sounds like that good. I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re making progress on that. So it&#x27;s kind of interesting and look I don&#x27;t want to go too far here and be like this revolution doesn&#x27;t matter. But when you put aside the computer programming stuff which is</p>
<p>a discussion for another time it&#x27;s complicated more complicated than people make it out to be but that&#x27;s a discussion for another time. And when you put aside other AI stuff that&#x27;s unrelated to all these billions we invested, what we are getting right now out of the whatever it is $500 billion that have been invested uh into Generative AI, there&#x27;s not a ton of home runs yet. And I think this is an a difficult point for AI boosters is why there&#x27;s a lot of like what is going to happen next year? And we&#x27;ve done this five years in a row now almost. what is going to happen next</p>
<p>year is where the conversation goes because I think it&#x27;s hard not to admit the real concrete things are coming a little slower than we think. Now there we we see these amazing demos. We see these things do great on benchmarks and we have all these scary scenarios which are real like look at these fake videos. What&#x27;s going to happen to truth or students can produce their papers on these things? But if we really think about it, the stuff that like what&#x27;s changing your mind, people are using this like a better version of Google and then they&#x27;re very narrow right now. Now, this doesn&#x27;t mean much bigger changes aren&#x27;t coming, but I thought this was an</p>
<p>interesting sort of experiment to do that when we actually look at what has already come specifically from investing all of this money into gener. hard not to conclude that like so far um it&#x27;s not massive yet. Hey, if you like this video, I think you&#x27;ll really like this one as well. Check it out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

 Everyone knows that excessive smartphone use can be harmful. But the question we don’t ask enough is what the advantages are of *not* using these devices. In the ideas segment, Cal examines the testimonials of four subjects who spent significant time without phones, to learn what they actually experience. Then, in the practices segment, he dissects the latest viral online self-help sensation to see if it holds up or is just fluff. Finally, in the Q&amp;amp;A segment he tackles a surprising (and distressing) way in which technology plays a role in the violent ICE raids happening in Minnesota.

<h2>What happens when you ditch your smartphone</h2>
<p>Those of us in the technology criticism space talk a lot about the harms created by smartphones. Now, we all know what these are because we live with them. I&#x27;m talking about constant distraction or a distorted view of the world or the dumbing down of our brains or the social isolation or the gambling, the porn, the videos of random people fist fighting. None of this is good. We all agree about that. But here&#x27;s an idea that I&#x27;ve longed to believe. It&#x27;s not enough to just list the harms. The problem is that phones also have legitimate uses. And the harms</p>
<p>when considered in isolation don&#x27;t really seem so bad in the moment. Your mind might very reasonably ask, &quot;Is anything really all that terrible going to happen if I look at Tik Tok for a little bit during my bus commute home?&quot; So, it becomes hard to convince your brain to put in the effort required for sustained behavioral changes. And this is why we tend to fall back into our old phone habit. So, what would work better? I think we need to also explore the benefits of a life without all of this digital noise. We&#x27;re wired to find</p>
<p>motivation in positive images that seem very desirable. This can inspire much more regular action over time than simply listing harms that you want to avoid. What we need in this phone conversation, therefore, is a better understanding of what goes right when you&#x27;re away from that device. So, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to explore today in our idea segment. We&#x27;re going to hear from real people who actually ditch their smartphones describing what their life actually feels like. All right. Then in our</p>
<p>practices segment, we&#x27;re going to dissect a viral essay that has been read online an absolutely absurd amount of times over the past few weeks. I think something like 170 million times on X alone. The article is titled How to Fix Your Entire Life in One Day. And it&#x27;s written by the popular YouTuber Dan Co. So last week on the show, we debated whether or not the internet was helping our ambition or hijacking it. So this is a great case study of that discussion. So we&#x27;ll look closer at this essay. We&#x27;ll pull out the big ideas and then we&#x27;ll try to assess at the end. Is this something that&#x27;s going to make our life</p>
<p>better or is it just clickbait bro nonsense? Then finally during the Q&amp;A segment I&#x27;m going to touch on a hot button issue, the ICE immigration crackdown raids in Minnesota. And as I&#x27;ll explain in more detail, I don&#x27;t normally talk about issues that don&#x27;t have a strong connection to technology criticism, but in this case, I think there is a strong connection to technology. And so buckle up, we&#x27;re going to get into that topic as well. So clearly we have a lot to cover today. As always, I&#x27;m Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about the fight for</p>
<p>depth in a distracted world. And we&#x27;ll get started right after the music. All right, so the goal of our idea segment is to figure out what it&#x27;s really like to live without constant</p>
<h2>Ideas segment</h2>
<p>access to a smartphone. Now, to accomplish this goal, we had to find people who ditched their smartphones and who reported what it actually felt like. Where can we find such subjects? YouTube. Our crack research team here at the Deep Questions podcast tracked down four different people who reported on YouTube what it was like to live for various durations without their phone. So, here&#x27;s the plan. We&#x27;ve pulled some clips from these testimonials and we&#x27;re going to go through these clips one by one and we&#x27;re going to pull out the benefits that these subjects seem to be</p>
<p>describing, right? Um, if you&#x27;re listening instead of just watching, you&#x27;ll actually be able to see these videos on the screen. And if you&#x27;re uh you might want to jump over to the YouTube version because, you know, these are some of them are actually in kind of scenic locations, so it&#x27;s sort of fun to watch, but you&#x27;ll be able to hear it all as well if you&#x27;re just a listener. Um, and then what we&#x27;re going to do is we&#x27;re going to make a table as we go along of the benefits. And when we&#x27;re done, we&#x27;re going to analyze what have we learned about the benefits of phone free living. And we might even do some thinking about can we get closer to that even if we still can&#x27;t get rid of our phone all together. All right, so we got a lot to do here.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s start with our first subject. Our first subject of phone free living is a young man named David Boland. Uh, as far as I can tell, he&#x27;s a 30-something YouTuber who last year went on a week-long trip without a smartphone and then immediately recorded a video to describe what it felt like. Um, this is the least extreme of all the phone freedom experiments that we&#x27;re going to encounter in today&#x27;s idea segment. So, I thought it was a good place to start. Uh, one week is not that long, but it&#x27;s still long enough to get a sense of, hey, what changes when you don&#x27;t have a phone? Uh, for those who are watching instead of listening, you&#x27;ll notice he&#x27;s</p>
<p>sitting in a chair in the middle of a field while he talks, which I don&#x27;t know, seems somehow appropriate for this clip. There&#x27;s also good background music as well. All right, so I got three clips I want to play from David Bolan. Um, Jesse, let&#x27;s start with the the first one. &gt;&gt; That [music] that that that uh I was recently away in the woods for 5 days with no technology, no phone, no internet, just lovely campfires and lovely conversations with lovely people.</p>
<p>We used the wood from the forest. We had to [music] dig holes in order to use the toilet. There were no toilets as we know it. [music] And it was an incredible time. And I didn&#x27;t [music] feel any anxiety. I mean, any crazy [music] amounts of anxiety. &gt;&gt; All right. So, there we go. Uh, the first clip we hear him talking about anxieties is reducing and him having to dig a hole for a toilet. He really</p>
<p>emphasized that, Jesse. I guess that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a key part of that experience. All right. Um, he elaborates then on what he meant by anxiety going down. So, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s hear this second clip. &gt;&gt; The most profound thing was that while I was away, while I was off the phone, I just wasn&#x27;t thinking about people that weren&#x27;t in front of me for the most part. Maybe I had a fond thought about somebody or some memory or whatever, but fundamentally, I was dealing with what [music] was in front of me. And the moment I went back online, I saw all of these messages</p>
<p>about things that were kind of trivial. &gt;&gt; All right. So interesting here, right? So when he talked about his anxiety being reduced specifically, he was saying when he has his phone, he&#x27;s often thinking about other people who aren&#x27;t there and what they might be thinking and what they might be thinking about him or what they&#x27;re not thinking about him. It gives you enough of a sense of sort of fake connection to lots of people that it&#x27;s hard to shake your social stimulation circuits in your brain and it makes him anxious. And when he was away from his phone, those thoughts about what are other</p>
<p>people thinking really reduce because he was just caring about the people who were actually right there. And when you&#x27;re just dealing with people who are actually right there, things can be a lot less stressful. Um Jesse, I know we had a third clip. I&#x27;m actually going to skip that third clip because I think we got to what we need from David Bolan. Um, I&#x27;m going to load up on the screen now our table of benefits of phone-f free living and we&#x27;ll add to it reduced anxiety. I&#x27;m going to say that is the main that&#x27;s sort of the main lesson from David Boland is that he was no longer so worried about what other people were thinking and what other people were</p>
<p>doing. He could be more present and when you&#x27;re more present you are less anxious. All right, so that was our first subject. We&#x27;ve already learned something. Our second subject, I don&#x27;t know his actual name but his YouTube handle is wheezy waiter. uh he&#x27;s in his 40s, so he&#x27;s more like Jesse and I&#x27;s age. Now, he did an experiment that was more extreme. He quit his smartphone for a year, so he really wanted to see what an extended period of life was like without his smartphone. And the what&#x27;s useful to us is he did a video log along the way. Hey, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m feeling this day.</p>
<p>So, he was doing a real time logging. The clip I want to play for you now actually is from very early in this experiment. I think this is day three of his experiment. and he&#x27;s already having very significant observations. So Jesse, let&#x27;s play that clip. &gt;&gt; So far, not really that hard at all and enjoyable. I&#x27;ve been reading more. I&#x27;ve texted back and forth with people. It&#x27;s a little bit more clunky with this thing. I haven&#x27;t really been leaving the house, so it hasn&#x27;t been that much of a challenge, but I&#x27;m using social media way less. The thing that&#x27;s constantly happening is I&#x27;ll want to look something up. Someone will mention a celebrity and</p>
<p>be like, &quot;What was that person in?&quot; Or I&#x27;ll get an idea for a video and I&#x27;ll want to Google what&#x27;s already out there. Uh-oh, now you know my research secrets. I use Google. I have prevented probably like 50 rabbit holes I could have gone down and what I did instead have my own thoughts and those thoughts are less chaotic and stressful. My mind is able to focus on the ongoing conversations I&#x27;m having with people in my life rather than the ongoing conversations I&#x27;m having with everything happening in the world. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I think there&#x27;s some really good new observations there. So, he uh he was emphasizing that when he had his phone, it made his brain more</p>
<p>chaotic, right? because you had this sort of feedback loop where as soon as you had a thought, you could actually follow that thought by googling it or going down some sort of digital rabbit hole and then you jump back to what you&#x27;re doing and back to another rabbit hole. And he didn&#x27;t realize the chaos of that cognitive space until he actually stepped away from his phone. And what did he find when that chaos had been dissipated that he could focus on whatever was happening around him? He talked about conversations where he could be fully present in the conversation, not thinking about what else do I need to look up or what thoughts is this</p>
<p>conversation spurring that I need to chase. He could just be there in the world. He felt less frenetic. I think this is just explaining a uh a less busy mind that then allowed him to be there for everything else in a way that he hadn&#x27;t experienced in a long time. So after only three days, he was spending much more time doing things that were meaningful to him. So Jesse, I&#x27;m going to add this. If we bring up our table again, I&#x27;ll add this as our second benefit to phone free living. More time engaged in meaningful activities. All right, so we&#x27;re making progress</p>
<p>here. Uh we&#x27;re going to move on now to our third subject. His name is Nate O&#x27;Brien. I think he&#x27;s the youngest of the people we&#x27;re going to hear from. He was uh in his mid20s when he recorded this video which was about a year ago. He was a popular personal financeoriented YouTuber. He actually left the medium a year ago and I think he just announced that he&#x27;s moving into a cabin in the woods that&#x27;s off the grid which is interesting. But when he talked about why he&#x27;s doing that, one of the big things he cited actually was his phone. And so I think this experiment he did with phone free</p>
<p>living actually had a real impact on him. Anyways, uh his experiment was 30 days without his phone and I&#x27;m going to play a clip here where he talks about an interesting benefit of that experiment. &gt;&gt; This myself that like when if I don&#x27;t have any downtime, if I don&#x27;t have any boredom and there&#x27;s no moments for me to have like this creative kind of like mind wandering thinking about stuff, I don&#x27;t really feel good when I don&#x27;t allow myself to do that. And so this is the biggest thing that I&#x27;ve learned from not having my phone on me is that it allowed myself to be bored. It allowed</p>
<p>myself to have that downtime and then also to to recognize things that maybe I wasn&#x27;t aware of before. Like, &gt;&gt; so this is really interesting. I hadn&#x27;t thought about this benefit before, but it was kind of profound to hear it from someone, especially someone who probably because he&#x27;s young, has probably never had any substantial quiet time alone with his brain since he was, you know, eight or nine years old because his whole life has been defined by the digital. And when he didn&#x27;t have his phone, he had downtime and boredom, right? Where it&#x27;s just my mind wandering. And he said, &#x27;Wow,</p>
<p>I really felt myself once I let my mind actually just be bored and wander. Like when his mind was constantly having to be engaged, it was almost like you could imagine there&#x27;s a scrim between you and your internal definition of yourself. This is probably because when your mind wanders, that&#x27;s where you reflect. That&#x27;s where you integrate information and make sense of it. That&#x27;s where you update your understanding of yourself and the world around you. Without these regular occasions for contemplation, you basically become an NPC that&#x27;s just bouncing one viral content capsule after</p>
<p>another off of yourself and throwing it towards other people. So, letting his mind actually wander and think and make sense of things on its own under its own steam allowed Nate to really feel like himself. So, let&#x27;s add this Jesse to our table here. This will be our third element. more mind wandering which helps you feel like yourself. That&#x27;s going to be our third benefit of phoneree living. All right, let&#x27;s move on now to our fourth subject here. I love this name. His name, Jesse, is Bjorn Andreas Bull Hansen. Uh he is the subject that will</p>
<p>probably remind most of you the most of me. I would probably you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s like a cow type character in the sense that he&#x27;s a bearded Scandinavian who hasn&#x27;t phoned a owned a phone in years and spends much of his time surviving in the wilderness.&quot; This guy&#x27;s awesome, Jesse. He makes great videos. It&#x27;s like him in the woods making a fire to like kill the the the cook the reindeer he killed with his bare hands. Anyways, this guy is a fascinating character. His videos are always shot in beautiful location. So certainly you might want to jump to the YouTube version of the podcast to see this clip. Um unlike the other subjects who ran temporary experiments,</p>
<p>Bejorn just straight up doesn&#x27;t own a smartphone. He just doesn&#x27;t see the point. He has like a dumb phone that he&#x27;s sometime you&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll hear about it that he sometimes brings with him. All right. So, in this clip, let me set the scene for people who are listening. Uh, he&#x27;s in a shelter that he built in the woods out of logs with like a fire going. And in another clip, he&#x27;s standing by like a river near his shelter and he&#x27;s just reflecting on life without his phone. All right, so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s uh hear this clip from Bejorn. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s uh beautiful here. And uh one of the big advantages of uh not having a</p>
<p>smartphone is that you get to take it all in without distractions. And uh many times I don&#x27;t even uh bring my phone. I have a what I call a dumb phone, oldfashioned phone, but I don&#x27;t always bring it. All right. All right. So, what Bjorn&#x27;s talking about, which I think is important, the world can be really interesting and beautiful and a real source of gratitude and peace if you can notice it. And he says, &quot;Look, if I had a phone with me, I&#x27;m not going to notice this beauty around me.&quot; And it really is</p>
<p>shot in a beautiful location, the Scandinavian forest or wherever he is. I think Sweden or is really beautiful. And he&#x27;s like, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t appreciate that if I was there.&quot; Interestingly, Jesse, because I watched a whole video with him later, one of the things he talks about is a little bit of like inside baseball on YouTube. He says there&#x27;s a lot of these outdoor YouTube channels where people are outdoor doing like survival stuff or camping stuff or bushcraft or whatever. And he says a lot of these outdoor YouTubers, they have their phones with them and as soon as the camera turns off, they&#x27;re on their phone checking their like YouTube whatever on</p>
<p>social media. And he says it&#x27;s such a waste. It&#x27;s so fake. The whole point of being out there in nature is to get the psychic benefits of being alone in a Washington peace and all this greenery. And if you&#x27;re instead on the phone, you don&#x27;t get those benefits. Now, you don&#x27;t have to have the name Bejorn and live in Scandinavia to get those benefits. You don&#x27;t have to be in the middle of nowhere in the forest. I mean, walking through a city, walking through a quiet suburb, walking like after the snowstorm we just had here, while everything is covered in iced and it&#x27;s quiet and there&#x27;s no cars on the road and you can just uh hear things so clearly because</p>
<p>of the crisp cold air without much moisture in it. These are all moments you can get lost in and have a lot of gratitude and find a lot of peace, but not if you have your phone with you. So, Jesse, let&#x27;s add this as our fourth element to our list of benefits of phone free living. It allows you to notice beauty and find peace in the moment. All right, so there&#x27;s our full table. I&#x27;m going to read all four of them here. Here&#x27;s the benefits we encountered from people who really did this. Reduced anxiety, more time engaged in meaningful activities, more mind wandering, which helps you feel like yourself, and you can notice beauty and find peace in the</p>
<p>moment. So hopefully just me listing those benefits will motivate you to consider more sustained action about your digital life. Hopefully, this is more inspiring than me just simply listing the harms of actually using a phone too much. But there&#x27;s an elephant in the room here. The reality is that for most people, going completely smartphone free just isn&#x27;t practical. I mean, think about the examples we just gave there. Only one of those four subjects remains smartphone free to this day. The other ones did it temporarily and then went back to at</p>
<p>least partially how they were living before. To make this difficulty uh even more clear, I&#x27;m going to play a clip that I actually find quite distressing. Um this is the acclaimed director Wernner Herzog who has long been famous for not using a smartphone, right? He&#x27;s always been too busy creating his, you know, movies and documentaries to have a smartphone. This is a clip from just three minutes ago where he goes on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s podcast. It starts with Conan praising Herzog for not owning a smartphone and then Herzog drops a very distressing bomb. So, let&#x27;s play this clip real quick, Jesse. Well, I don&#x27;t know how you</p>
<p>survive without a cell phone in the modern era. &gt;&gt; Easily. Easily. I enjoy it. I do read. But in fact, uh I had to get myself a cell phone. Technically, I have one now because what happened uh uh in Dublin. I was filming at the train station, parked my car at the adjacent uh uh train station building and I couldn&#x27;t get out of it because uh it would open only um with a application on a cell phone.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I love Herzog&#x27;s voice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what I want to see? Here&#x27;s the content I want to see. Bejorn Bull Hansen and Warner Herzog trying to figure out how to make their iPhone 13 work. He&#x27;s like, they&#x27;re trying to get like the AirPods to work out in the woods somewhere. Herzog would be like, I think you need to go to the Bluetooth settings. And Bjorn would be like, nature doesn&#x27;t need Bluetooth. Nature controls all. And then Herzog would say, maybe we need pairing</p>
<p>mode. And then uh Bejorn would uh come by, run past in the background. and you see him jump onto a reindeer and break its neck. That would be good content. Warner Herzog and Bejorn Hansen Bull Hansen figuring out an iPhone. All right, so even Warner Herzog, the one of the canonical examples of people who never owned a smartphone had to get one because the reality of modern life is there&#x27;s just too many things that requires it. I mean, this is true for me as well. I can&#x27;t even log into the course website for my courses at Georgetown anymore without having a smartphone because I have to have</p>
<p>two-factor security, which requires an app. It&#x27;s like very difficult to go completely smartphone free. But I want to find a bright side in here because what we just did is we pulled out specific benefits of going phone free. So if we can know what we&#x27;re going for, there might be a way like if we want to think about our our smartphone habits instead of just saying smartphones are bad, try to use it less. we can say how can we design our interaction with a smartphone such that those four benefits that we just listed we can get the bulk</p>
<p>of those in our life still if we aim at trying to move closer to benefits and instead of just trying to in general reduce usage we might be able to get like 80% of the way towards those benefits we heard from those people who were living without smartphones so I think this is possible I thought a lot about this and what I tried to do is come up with what would be the advice I could offer about how you your relationship with your phone that would most move you towards those four benefits. And I came up with uh three ideas. So I&#x27;m going to write these on</p>
<p>the screen here. Um for those who are who are listening, what&#x27;s up on my chalkboard here, it says advice to become practically phone free. And I can kind of put practically in quotation marks, I guess, because it means both. It&#x27;s practical advice and you&#x27;re not really phone free, but it&#x27;s almost like you are. That&#x27;s why I call it practically phone free. All right. But I got three things to suggest to get us close to those benefits while you could still own a smartphone. All right. So, the the first thing that I&#x27;m going to suggest, and I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;m going to uh draw these, Jesse. Oh, god. This is always a a gamble when I try to draw</p>
<p>things. All right. So, I&#x27;m going to draw I think I&#x27;m already proud of myself. Can you tell that&#x27;s the old Twitter logo? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; kind of. All right. All right. So, I drew the old the old uh the old Twitter logo and I put a cross through it like the the circle and a cross around it. All right. So, what&#x27;s the advice here that that represents? Don&#x27;t put any social media apps on your phone. If you have on there, take them off. In general, avoid on your smartphone any app where someone makes more money the more you use it. If you need to use social media, like for work</p>
<p>or something like this, access it on your laptop where it&#x27;s boring and it&#x27;s not with you at all times. It&#x27;s something you have to go do and load up a web page and type an URL and it&#x27;s not really that fun. It&#x27;s not default distraction. It&#x27;s more I&#x27;m specifically going to get information. The goal here is to make your phone more instrumental and less entertaining. To make it more the type of thing that sure, I have it so that I can open the parking gate of Dublin, but it&#x27;s not that interesting outside of that because there&#x27;s nothing on it that really gets my attention. All right. So,</p>
<p>you still are doing practical things with your your smartphone, but now it&#x27;s less of a a brain warping constant companion. All right, I have a second piece of advice here. I&#x27;m going to expertly draw something. Let&#x27;s see if Jesse can figure out what I&#x27;m drawing here. Okay, let&#x27;s see here. Uh oh. Uh oh. Does it look What do you think this is, Jesse? &gt;&gt; Like a island in a kitchen. Yeah. All right. There we go. Yeah. It&#x27;s like a kitchen and I&#x27;m drawing. So I drew like</p>
<p>a kitchen counter and then on top of that kitchen counter I am drawing an expertly rendered smartphone and we can imagine that it&#x27;s like uh plugged into I&#x27;m just going to go nuts with my drawing here. Plug into the wall. Perfect. All right. So the rule here this is the kitchen dock method. When you&#x27;re at home, you leave your phone plugged in in the kitchen. All right. If you need to listen to like an audio book or my podcast or something like that while you&#x27;re doing chores, yeah, use AirPods, like something wireless and okay, fine.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re at like a part of the house where the AirPods don&#x27;t reach, plug your phone in a little bit closer to where you are so you can still if you need to listen to AirPods, but otherwise the the phone lives there when you&#x27;re at home. So, if you need to look something up, uh you go to the kitchen where it&#x27;s plugged in, you look it up there. If you know you&#x27;re waiting for a call or you&#x27;re participating in a text message thread, you have to go there and stand in the kitchen to do it. It&#x27;s not with you. Now, what this gives you is a a significant stretch in your day every day, assuming you&#x27;re going to be home like at night and in the morning at the very least. It gives you a significant</p>
<p>stretch during the day where your phone is not a constant companion, where you&#x27;re doing lots of things. You&#x27;re eating meals with your family. You&#x27;re watching TV. You&#x27;re reading. You&#x27;re doing lots of things where the phone is not in hand reach. And it begins to change that relationship you have where this is a a constant companion that you experience your day with and through that when you&#x27;re reading every four or five minutes you check in on like baseball trade rumors or when you&#x27;re watching something you&#x27;re also looking at social media and going down rabbit holes about the characters that you see in the show. It breaks you of that habit which again is going to transform the phone back to</p>
<p>be instrumental. You still have it that that you can go have the logistical text conversation. You can still open up the gate when you&#x27;re in Dublin, whatever Warner Herzog was doing, but it&#x27;s less of a constant companion that&#x27;s warping your and distorting your view of the world. So, you&#x27;re going to begin to get a lot more of those benefits. All right. And I got one more piece of advice to offer here. So, what we&#x27;re going to start with here is a rendition of expert rendition of someone walking. He has a really long torso. Um, and then he is holding That&#x27;s not really well drawn. So, this</p>
<p>is supposed to be if I put if I put lines around it, flip phone &gt;&gt; or a pipe or really he looks like he&#x27;s armed to be honest. Um, I drew a picture of someone walking with a dumb phone. I suggest that you buy and own a dumb phone like these people had during their experiments. It&#x27;s not that hard to do anymore. There&#x27;s a lot of websites that can help you find them and get wireless plans for them. You can do this whole thing for $15 a month or less and it&#x27;s worth it. Why do you need a dumb phone? I want you to identify more and more situations in your life where you&#x27;re</p>
<p>leaving your house to do something constrained like you&#x27;re going for a walk, you&#x27;re going for a hike, you&#x27;re going for errands where you might need a phone for emergency contact, right? Like if your your kids might call from school or your wife needs you or you&#x27;re telling your business partner like, &quot;Hey, if we hear back from so- and so, call me because it&#x27;s very timely.&quot; So, you have a way for someone to contact you in case of emergency. But there&#x27;s nothing else interesting you can do on that. And again, you&#x27;re going to now have more experiences where you can be fully present in interesting situations. So when you&#x27;re walking the dog or you&#x27;re out in the woods because you don&#x27;t have a phone that&#x27;s interesting</p>
<p>like Bejorn, you can get completely lost in that situation. You no longer have the excuse of I need to be in touch. It&#x27;s too dangerous not to have my phone because you do have a phone with you. It&#x27;s just not a very interesting one. And you still have your smartphone for other cases like again when you go to Dublin and need to get out of the parking garage. You&#x27;re not getting rid of the smartphone, but it&#x27;s not with you now when you don&#x27;t need it on excursions where being really present might be better. Going out with friends is another great example. I meet my friends for dinner. I don&#x27;t have a smartphone to look at. You know what happens? You get itchy for a while. That passes and then you&#x27;re fully present</p>
<p>with those people here. And when they get up and go to the bathroom, you&#x27;re just like, I&#x27;m just going to sit here and just like see the restaurant. I&#x27;m not going to immediately start looking at things. All right. So, let&#x27;s pull this back up. We got three pieces of advice here. Nothing interesting on your phone. Keep your phone plugged into the kitchen when you&#x27;re home. Own a dumb phone that you use when you uh when you&#x27;re going somewhere where you don&#x27;t absolutely need a smartphone. I think that will actually inject into your life a lot of the phone free benefits that we talked about. You&#x27;re going to be more present in a lot of situations.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re going to feel a lot less distracted because you don&#x27;t have you&#x27;re you&#x27;re deprogramming the constant companion. You&#x27;re going to find much more time to do other things because this this this plan has you spending a lot more time without your phone there and yet you still own a smartphone for the apps, the music apps, the audible apps, that&#x27;s still on there. When you need the text message group text messages, which is really useful on a phone, it might be plugged in the kitchen, but you can still do it. Or when you&#x27;re on you&#x27;re meeting someone, you&#x27;re trying to arrange to meet them, you can still have your phone and do that. Or you&#x27;re on a road trip, you need the map, you still have it. So, you&#x27;re still keeping those benefits of having a phone while also getting the</p>
<p>bulk of the benefits that those subjects we talked about before experience by not having a phone. All right. So, anyways, this specific advice might not fit for you, but I I think it&#x27;s a good way to think about your relationship with your phone is not just I want to use this less because again, that&#x27;s just going to dissipate in intensity over time until you&#x27;re back to where you started. It&#x27;s figuring out the benefits of phone free living you want and figuring out what rules or constraints can I place that move me closer to those benefits. Those are much more likely to stick. Rules and constraints that move you closer to a</p>
<p>positive vision are just much more likely to stick than rules and constraints that are trying to reduce something that you think is like generally kind of negative. So, it&#x27;s a different way of thinking about what to do with your phone. But I think we learned a lot from those case studies. Uh, and I think that led us to some interesting insights. I think Jesse, we got to play that David Borland music like all the time. It was like, &gt;&gt; yeah, the music in the background of those videos are pretty great. &gt;&gt; Isn&#x27;t that great? Like, especially that stuff. I mean, &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re in a spa. &gt;&gt; We could be doing a an ad read for a colon cleanse powder, but with that background music, people would, you</p>
<p>know, wipe away &gt;&gt; wipe away a tear from their eye. &gt;&gt; Like, yeah, my my colon could use a regular scrub. [laughter] equivalent of 17 grams of fiber. Wow. This the music&#x27;s playing. I&#x27;m talking really slowly. That guy has got it figured out. All right. Um, so there we go. That was our uh that was our practice our idea segment for the day. Um, and now we&#x27;re going to move on to consider our practice segment. Let&#x27;s talk fashion. You&#x27;ve heard me talk</p>
<p>before about how much I like my rag and bone jeans. Their infused denim feels soft and it&#x27;s broken in and it&#x27;s quality. Like you could wear these for years on end without wearing them out. And they also look great, right? They have this eightstep overdye process that makes the patterns look unique and interesting. Rag and Bone, however, does more than just pants. I recently got one of their denim trucker jackets, and it&#x27;s become one of my absolute favorite jackets. If you&#x27;re watching this on YouTube right now, you can see I I put it on so you can see it. Uh, rag and bone denim can make even an MI train MIT</p>
<p>trained computer scientist look cool. So, hey, that should probably be their slogan. Actually, can make even an MIT trained computer scientist look cool. Um, here&#x27;s the thing. It&#x27;s time to upgrade your denim with Rag and Bone. For a limited time, our listeners get 20% off their entire order with code deep at rag-bone.com. That&#x27;s 20% off at rag-bone.com with promo code deep. So, that&#x27;s the word rag the wordbone.com and use that promo code deep. And when you uh if they ask you where you heard about them, please support our show and let them know we sent you. I also want to talk</p>
<p>about our friends at Caldera Lab. Men, let me level with you. We need to take better care of our skin. We&#x27;re trained to think about our muscles and our hairline and the awesome mustaches that our wives and girlfriends won&#x27;t let us grow, but we ignore our skin. Here is the solution. Calira Lab. Calira Lab makes high performance skin care designed specifically for men&#x27;s skin. More importantly, they&#x27;ve simplified the use of their products into a straightforward three-step routine. Step one, you use the Clean Slate, which is a cleanser that gets the the dirt and oil and sweat off your skin. I love using</p>
<p>that, by the way. You can tell your skin feels much better afterwards. Uh, step two, you use the Great, which is their serum that&#x27;s clinically proven to reduce wrinkles. And then step three, you use the hydrolayer moisturizer to lock in moisture all day. That&#x27;s it. I have them. I use these products. I, again, I mentioned I really like the cleanser. It foams and it makes me feel somehow like uh I&#x27;m not the Joker after he falls in the acid bath in the original Burton Batman movie, which is a reference all the kids get, Jesse, and I like to make it. Um, so this uh I like Caldera Labs. I like their three-step process. We&#x27;re</p>
<p>in the winter. Your skin&#x27;s going to be super dry and whatever. This is the right time to pick it up. So go to calderab.com/deep and use code deep to get 20% off your first order. All right, let&#x27;s get back to our show. All right, so this is where we like to get super practical. Here&#x27;s what I want to do today is I&#x27;m going to take a very piece of practical internet advice and we&#x27;re going to dissect it. Let me load this on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening. It&#x27;s from the YouTuber Dan Co. It&#x27;s an article he posted as an essay on Twitter</p>
<h2>Assessing the Internet’s Latest Self-Help Sensation</h2>
<p>called How to Fix Your Entire Life in One Day. And let me zoom in on that. 173 million reads so far. That&#x27;s pretty crazy, Jesse. That&#x27;s like almost as many copies as I&#x27;ve sold of How to Become a High School Superstar. I was just gonna say &gt;&gt; not quite not quite how to become a high school superstar level, but man, that guy is getting close. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s getting close to that level. Um I didn&#x27;t even know you could post essays on Twitter. I guess that&#x27;s a thing. Uh I&#x27;ll tell you who&#x27;s going to be doing it now. Everybody, because this one article got 173 million views. Anyways, how to</p>
<p>fix your entire life in one day. Viral internet advice. Why are we going to look at that in the practices segment? Well, it&#x27;s practical advice and we&#x27;re going to break it apart and we&#x27;re going to go through the the seven suggestions he has. But I&#x27;m thinking about this exercise in the light of last week&#x27;s episode where we had Brad Stolberg on and he was talking about his new book, The Way of Excellence. And we were talking about in general what is the impact of in the internet on our natural instinct for ambition. And we said look it could be one of two things. Sometimes it actually can help guide us and help us fulfill our</p>
<p>ambitions. And sometimes it can hijack our ambitions, but sort of like nonsense content that in the moment feels really good, but is actually distracting us from things that really matter. This seems like a great case study to apply this type of thinking. Is Dan Co super viral article something that&#x27;s hijacking our ambition or supporting it? So, we&#x27;re going to go through it real quick and uh I&#x27;ll get Jesse&#x27;s opinion. I&#x27;ll tell you my opinion. I actually talked to Brad about this last night, so I&#x27;ll tell you what he said. So, we&#x27;re going to kind of have a little court of inquiry at the end. All right. So, we&#x27;re going to go through</p>
<p>this really quickly. Um I&#x27;m going to start by reading from his intro his words just to set up how he describes this and then we&#x27;ll go through a seven pieces of advice. So, here&#x27;s what Dan says. If you&#x27;re anything like me, you think New Year&#x27;s resolutions are stupid. Because most people go about changing their lives in a completely wrong way. They create these resolutions because everyone else does. We create a superficial meaning out of status games. But they don&#x27;t meet the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than convincing yourself you&#x27;re going to be a more dis more disciplined or more productive this year. I&#x27;m eliding a</p>
<p>little bit. However, as much as I think New Year&#x27;s resolutions are stupid, it&#x27;s always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself towards something that that&#x27;s much better, as we will discuss. So whether you want to start the business or transform your body or take the risk toward a more meaningful life without quitting after 2 weeks, I want to share seven ideas you probably haven&#x27;t heard before on behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in 2026. All right. So, that&#x27;s a pretty lofty goal, Jesse. Um, he has seven pieces of advice. Let&#x27;s go through these one by</p>
<p>one. I&#x27;ll give you a quick summary. All right. So, here&#x27;s piece of advice one. I&#x27;ll show it briefly on the screen. Uh, you you aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you aren&#x27;t a person who would be there. Does that kind of make sense? That&#x27;s a little bit We&#x27;re going to have to untangle a little bit of things here. Um, I read that more carefully. Here&#x27;s how I summarized it in my own notes here. Lifestyle trumps discipline. Instead of setting a surface level goal and hyping yourself to remain disciplined for a few weeks, consider creating a lifestyle that makes the outcome you desire uh much easier if or even unavoidable, right? So, I think</p>
<p>that&#x27;s what when I when I read this closely, I think that&#x27;s what he says is lifestyle is better than discipline. All right? He doesn&#x27;t tell you to do that yet. That&#x27;s what the rest of advice is about. All right. Here&#x27;s idea two. Pull this up here. The way he his title here is you aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you don&#x27;t want to be there. You can&#x27;t do this with the English language, Jesse. There&#x27;s a lot of negatives and negative negatives and okay, it&#x27;s a little circular, but I read this carefully. Here&#x27;s my summary of idea two. Your behaviors follow your desires. Our behavior isn&#x27;t goal oriented. I&#x27;m</p>
<p>I&#x27;m using his words here. It&#x27;s teological, meaning we do things because we want certain outcomes. For example, we procrastinate not because we lack discipline, but because we want to quote protect ourselves from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing our work and quote, you stay in the dead-end job because you want the security and predictability, etc., etc. So what he&#x27;s saying there Jesse is that um we are doing things because for certain outcomes we tell ourselves we do things to accomplish certain goals but actually our behaviors are often not just us</p>
<p>being undisiplined or not having a goal. there&#x27;s a the behaviors we don&#x27;t like often do have a goal that&#x27;s desirable to us. That for like a lot of people, it&#x27;s desirable not to work on these bigger projects because uh we don&#x27;t want to be in a a position to actually be assessed and be rejected or we actually like the security of this bad job. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not interested. So, he&#x27;s saying um behaviors follow desires. You have to think about what you actually desire in your life is more important than like what goals do you have. You should have let me help write this. I feel like I&#x27;m</p>
<p>a clue. &gt;&gt; The whole time I was thinking, is this the stuff you were teach those Dartmouth kids when you did that summer program? &gt;&gt; I thought [snorts] those kids had a right. All right. Number three. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s words. You aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you&#x27;re afraid to be there. You aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you&#x27;re afraid to be there. Okay. Uh here&#x27;s how I summarized that in my own notes. We protect the status quo for the sake of psychological consistency. Uh, so here&#x27;s this is literally in my notes, Jesse. I don&#x27;t fully understand this one. I tried to understand this</p>
<p>one. It got a little bit complicated, but my best read is you build an identity as you grow up and then you will go through a lot to protect it for the sake of psychological consistency, even if that identity is harmful. So, you sort of build up an understanding of yourself, which not necessarily a positive one. Um, but we want to whatever our self- understanding is, we want to protect it. And we might protect it by sabotaging goals that on paper might be like, hey, that&#x27;s really good and ambitious and something you should do, but it might challenge this identity we have about ourselves. Like, I&#x27;m no good at that. I&#x27;m not smart. I people</p>
<p>don&#x27;t respect me. And you don&#x27;t want to lose that identity. So, you you don&#x27;t pursue goals. So, there&#x27;s like a psychology there that&#x27;s important. All right. Idea four, uh, co- summarizes it this way. The life you want lies within a specific level of mind. All right. So again, here&#x27;s my notes here, Jesse. I wrote, I got fully lost in this one. Um, I&#x27;m going to read to you verbatim from a a a paragraph just so you get a sense of what I was dealing with here trying to summarize this one. This is me quoting, &quot;I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>talked about these many times and synthesized them into my own human 3.0 model and various AI prompts to uncover your level of development and a path forward. PN open a tab to read after if you like in PNS, but here&#x27;s the 8020 of the nine stages of ego development as a refresher because repetition helps reveal things you didn&#x27;t notice before and there are new people reading these letters. He then presents this table which will make it all clear to you, Jesse. All right, this is a real thing. My god. Um, if you&#x27;re listening instead of just watching, I have never seen a more</p>
<p>complicated. Is this a chart? It&#x27;s colors. It&#x27;s words. It&#x27;s quadrants. It looks like a little bit like you threw up Froot Loops, I guess, onto um like the printer test page. I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t pull this apart. Uh, I&#x27;ll just read various words on here. states of consciousness, lines of development, types, interactive vision logic, integrative vision logic, uh personalistic relativistic, individualistic pluralistic, four out of five, radical relativism, rules, single</p>
<p>system view. I don&#x27;t know. I I don&#x27;t know if this is something that uh that Dan put together or something that someone else did that he&#x27;s referencing. I didn&#x27;t really understand this one. So, let&#x27;s move on. All right. Idea five. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s summary. Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of life. All right, that&#x27;s very clear. I appreciate that. Um, he goes on to talk about cybernetics. Cybernetics is, you know, this is Norbert Weiner in the 1940s and 1950s talking about the merging of electronic mechanical machines and humans. So, you kind of like have feedback loops between like humans and machines and allows you to do something that a human by itself</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t do or a machine by itself couldn&#x27;t do. He was inspired by working on uh during the war like things for helping to aim anti-aircraft guns at fighter jets or not fighter jets, bombers and stuff like that. Uh so he references cybernetics to illustrate a model of goal pursuit where you keep making adjustments to your path along the way to keep coming back towards the right way forward. This is the photo. This is a useful photo. This is like a classic cybernetic thing. You constantly make adjustments. So you you kind of leave the right course but then you adjust and then that you go off the other way, you adjust again. If you keep</p>
<p>making adjustments, you make progress where towards you&#x27;re trying to get. Um, here&#x27;s his summary of the steps for a cybernetic approach to trying to get somewhere you want to get. Have a goal, act towards that goal, sense where you are, compare it to that goal, and act again based on that feedback. So, he&#x27;s saying, and I think this is very pragmatic, you need to constantly like assess where you are and adjust. That&#x27;s how you make progress towards something. You&#x27;re not just going to have the perfect plan and just follow it and then two years later you&#x27;re there. You have to constantly be like, where am I? I&#x27;ve made some progress, but I veered off the goal. So, what adjustments do I make for</p>
<p>going forward? Keep doing that and you&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll be moving in the general the general right direction. All right, idea piece of six. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s summary. How to launch into a completely new life in one day. So now he&#x27;s going to pull together a lot of these ideas. Um I went through this and I summarized there&#x27;s three parts. Now he&#x27;s trying to summarize how do you put all these things into action your life and there&#x27;s three parts. One for what you do in the morning, one for what you do throughout the day and what one for what you do at the end of the day for trying to put all these ideas into practice. So, what he recommends briefly is during the morning you do a vision and anti-vision exercise</p>
<p>where you spend 15 to 20 minutes reflecting on both what you like and don&#x27;t like about the path that you&#x27;re on. Like what do I want out of my life? What do I want my life to be? What would my life be like if I don&#x27;t do those things? This is like classic psychological uh possible future comparison. It&#x27;s very powerful actually. All right. So, you you you spend 15 20 minutes. He gives you some questions to answer. Then part two during the day he says you should interrupt autopilot to regularly ask yourself questions like what am I avoiding right now by doing what I&#x27;m doing and he says actually he has a list of these questions put them into calendar events so that they can</p>
<p>pop up with notifications and just remind you like stop whatever you&#x27;re doing and ask this question so he wants to break the idea of autopilot and keep you much more conscious about how you&#x27;re spending your time. Part three at the end of the day in the evening he wants you to synthesize any insight. So, integrate any insights you had during the day into your understanding of your identity. There&#x27;s some time here for self-reflection. For example, he says, &quot;Write a single sentence that captures what you&#x27;re building towards knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.&quot; Um, then he goes on and says, &quot;You should have multi-scale goals,&quot; which of course I&#x27;m a fan of. You have a daily</p>
<p>goal, monthly goal, and one-year scale goals that you can be keeping track of. Finally, idea seven, pull it up here. This is long. Look how long how much I have to scroll. So, it&#x27;s a long article. All right. Idea [clears throat] seven, turn your life into a video game. So here he&#x27;s saying you can gify some of this advice. Um I&#x27;m going to quote from him directly here. Your because I didn&#x27;t quite understand this, but maybe this will make sense to you, Jesse. Your vision is how you win, at least until the game evolves. Your anti- vision is what&#x27;s at stake. What happens if you lose or give up? Your one-year goal is the mission. This is your sole priority</p>
<p>in life. Your one-mon project is the boss fight, how you gain XP and acquire loot. Your daily levers are the quest, the daily process that unlocks new opportunities. Your constraints are the rules, the limitations that encourage creativity. Okay, I get this. Like you have um constraints in your life about things you do or don&#x27;t do. Each day you have certain things you do to like make that day better. On the factor of the month, you&#x27;re moving towards these one-mon goals, which move you closer to your one-year mission. And you have a vision and anti- vision to help you know this is what I want and this is what I want to avoid. And he&#x27;s talking about you can kind of think of it like a video</p>
<p>game. All right. So, there you go. I want to start by asking the question, why did this get so popular? Why did this rack up 173 million views and counting? Here&#x27;s my assessment, and Jesse, you can tell me if this makes sense to you. In self-help literature, there&#x27;s two different camps, two different types of self-help literature. The practical and the psychological, right? Um, so the the practical it&#x27;s it&#x27;s usually about like here is like really specific advice for achieving specific goals. Like in the world of books you might think about like James</p>
<p>Clear&#x27;s atomic habits. It&#x27;s like really specific advice for how you make progress on habits or maybe online you would think of like classic Ali Abdal. You know he&#x27;ll really talk about specific setups or configurations of your technology to make progress on certain goals. The other genre is psychological which is much more about the psychology behind your motivations and your actions. So, it&#x27;s about change your brain and you&#x27;re not going to get in the way of things that you want to do. So, in the book world, you might think about like Mark Manson&#x27;s book uh the subtle art or Mel Robbins&#x27;s new book, The Let Them theory. These are</p>
<p>psychological self-help books. Bnee Brown, I think, would fall in here as well. Less about step by step and more about changing your mind so the psychology doesn&#x27;t get in the way of action. So, these are both two genres that both have major bestsellers. I mean, right now, if you look at the bestseller list, James Clear and Mel Robbins are right there. All right. I think what this essay did is it combined practical and psychological self-help. He has like practical ideas. You want to do this, put these events on your calendar, gamify it this way, have goals at these levels. But he also talked a lot about the</p>
<p>psychology. The psychology that&#x27;s getting in your way, that&#x27;s preventing you from making progress. Why? What&#x27;s going on in your brain? He talked about both and he put them together and then he layered on top of that references and terminology that&#x27;s relevant to Ginz. I think that was a pretty powerful mix. Now, as you could tell by me going through it, I mean, look, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in my, you know, 40s. I&#x27;ve been a professional writer my whole life. I write for the New Yorker. I&#x27;m a writing snob. The writing is a little hard to follow sometimes, okay? Like, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s there&#x27;s ideas in there</p>
<p>that haven&#x27;t fully been fleshed out. There&#x27;s some of them are really are and some of them I you can&#x27;t do that to the English language. This is referencing this this and this. But you put that aside and this is Dan Co&#x27;s project. Let&#x27;s talk about psychology and practical put them together and in lingo that make sense to a generation on Tik Tok and Instagram and YouTube idioms of speech and that type of movement, right? That kind of like you keep moving and say lots of things. Not not like our generation of carefully crafted writing. When I look at it that way, I say this does not hijack ambition. I think</p>
<p>especially for a younger person, this would be useful. You start thinking about your mindset. You start thinking about practical advice. I mean, I think the system in here is pretty complicated. I think that rainbow, the Froot Loops vomit chart is going to not help be that helpful. I don&#x27;t know what the hell&#x27;s going on there. But in general, like, oh, I need to think about uh my psychology. That&#x27;s important. The practical advice seems pretty reasonable to me. vision and anti-vision planning is is actually incredibly effective. Make really clear what&#x27;ll happen if you don&#x27;t change and make really clear where you could get if you do. That&#x27;s very powerful</p>
<p>in motivating change. This idea that you need to change your understanding of yourself before you can make progress on certain goals. I think that&#x27;s interesting. The idea that people who do really important things often they&#x27;ve set up their lives in such a way that like making progress is something that of course they do. It&#x27;s not a fight. It&#x27;s not a willpower discipline fight. you got to change your life, not just change your goals. I think that&#x27;s important. Tracking things, having goals at multiple levels, I think that&#x27;s useful as well. So, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m going to if we have to choose hijack support, I think this leans for the support side. It&#x27;s not my cup of tea, but it wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>written for me. And uh hopefully I don&#x27;t know. I I think that could be pretty useful advice. All right, let&#x27;s take another quick break to hear from our sponsors.

What What&#x27;s your take, Jesse? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still flabbergasted about the 175 million views. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s a lot of people. I mean, I</p>
<p>maybe they get they get seen a lot of times. I don&#x27;t really know how that works. And I kept on I keep on thinking about this with your episode earlier a couple weeks ago about Substack too. &gt;&gt; Um yeah, and the fact that he &gt;&gt; and you mentioned the essay thing &gt;&gt; and he did this on Twitter which is interesting as opposed to like on Substack or something like that. &gt;&gt; I wonder if he has a Substack. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know man. This generation is not big on Substacks. There&#x27;s 8,000 replies. I I was reading through some of them and they were just like people like Yeah, it&#x27;s interesting. You know, sometimes you just catch the virality um genie in the bottle. Partially what&#x27;s happening</p>
<p>with this essay is what we&#x27;re doing here at large. Everybody is doing segments on the essay itself. So it&#x27;s getting like huge like after aftermarket. &gt;&gt; Yeah. To put in perspective like the Super Bowl in a couple weeks will probably get 110 million. &gt;&gt; But that&#x27;s people watching for four hours. Yeah. As opposed to a Twitter view. So I don&#x27;t know how to translate that to real people. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Maybe it is though because international, right? Like this is all around the world. People could look at it. Anyways, I think it&#x27;s amazing how many people seen it. And I&#x27;m not upset that this thing is viral. Again, not my</p>
<p>completely my cup of tea, but there&#x27;s good ideas in there. And the reason why it&#x27;s successful is not because of some weirdness or griiness. I think that&#x27;s an interesting merging of psychological practical and jinz into a a certain um potent stew. It&#x27;s a good time to announce my new book aimed at Jinzy where I will also call it how to make What did my What did my son say today? I completely misunderstood it. He said like, &quot;Oh, my my Magic the Gathering deck is now busted.&quot; And I I was like, &quot;Um, oh, sorry. So,</p>
<p>you&#x27;re going to have to like get better cards or whatever.&quot; He&#x27;s like, &quot;No, that means good.&quot; So, I don&#x27;t know. So, I&#x27;m going to call it how to make your life busted. Escape mid and get to B from basic to busted and fix your entire life in 17 minutes. See what I&#x27;m doing there? More extreme. And I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know any other references. So, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s going to be. Lessons from Mr. Beast. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know. All right. So, there we go.</p>
<p>Uh, that&#x27;s our practices segment. We&#x27;re going to move on now to questions and comments. So, we&#x27;re just doing one question today because I think it&#x27;s worthy of a long answer. Uh, Jesse, what&#x27;s our one question for today? As a technology and culture critic, what are your thoughts about what&#x27;s going on in Minnesota with ICE raids and clashes</p>
<h2>What do the ICE raids in Minnesota teach us about technology and its impacts on our society?</h2>
<p>with protesters? &gt;&gt; All right, so I&#x27;m going to talk about this in our Q&amp;A segment today. uh to back up a little bit. I I want to be clear that in general when it comes to big news or political issues, I follow the Chicago model. So out of the 1967 Clavner report from the University of Chicago, which calls for higher education institutions should have institutional neutrality, right? So the the Chicago model for higher educ higher education institutions was you really shouldn&#x27;t comment on the news of</p>
<p>the day unless it is very specifically applies to higher education and there&#x27;s a lot of reasons for this. One of the reasons for this was uh there could be a sort of chilling effect on scholars and free speech because maybe the institution stance on something conflicts with some of the scholars of the institution but there&#x27;s also a practical implication. The issue is once you start uh commenting on some things, you&#x27;re commenting on everything whether you want to or not. Like now even your silence on something becomes a comment. Once you&#x27;ve opened up the business of I&#x27;m going to assess things in the public sphere is good or bad. You&#x27;re in the</p>
<p>business of assessing all things in the public sphere is good or bad. A lot of colleges discovered this in the 2020s. They began commenting on a lot of things that were obviously bad, but they&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, wait a second. Now there&#x27;s a lot of other things too and our silence is just as a big of a deal as and a lot of institutions actually more recently said we&#x27;re going back to the Chicago model. So that&#x27;s what I generally do. This is a technology criticism podcast. I only want to talk about things connected to technology criticism. However, sometimes big political or otherwise world events overlap with the world of technology. So we talk about them here. It&#x27;s like after Charlie Kirk was killed, we did a podcast because I</p>
<p>saw a a connection between that and what it told us about the role of social media in our lives. We did a podcast on that. So, this brings us back to Minnesota. I think there is a strong connection between what&#x27;s happening there and some themes about technology criticism that are important large. And so, I&#x27;m going to talk about it today because I do think it connects to the topics we cover on this show. So, we got to start by setting the stage here. Uh, what is going on in Minnesota? It&#x27;s complicated because things are changing very rapidly. But, let me just</p>
<p>give you bring you up to speed on the my understanding and then I&#x27;m going to tell you how this connects to technology. Right? So, for those who aren&#x27;t following this closely, back in December, the Trump administration announced that they were surging a large new group of ICE and border agents, probably around 2 to 3,000, though they won&#x27;t give specific numbers, to the Minneapolis area for an intense immigration crackdown. They call this operation metro surge. Now, the result has been a series of high-profile detentions featuring swarms of masked agents that&#x27;s happening not just at homes, but like during morning commutes and outside schools and churches and at workplaces. Um, there&#x27;s also been</p>
<p>significant reports of opportunistic stops of individuals merely because of how they look as opposed to actual like targeted enforcement efforts. The Minneapolis police chiefs had a press conference recently where he said multiple non-white officers from the Minneapolis Police Force have been hassled by agents off duty just because you know clearly these were not people who were being targeted because they aren&#x27;t immigrants and they have no criminal past and they&#x27;re on the police force but out of their uniform they&#x27;ve had multiple police officers had been hassled with agents like who are</p>
<p>you etc etc. So we know this type of thing is going on. This has resulted in significant citizen uh push back and protest. To date, immigration officials in Minneapolis have shot and killed two protesters. One for uh trying to drive away, which seems to have annoyed one of the agents, and another one uh who was filming an arrest. He had a pistol on him. The agents took away the pistol and then after they took his pistol away, shot him in the back. So, as of the day we&#x27;re recording this, which is Tuesday, the Tuesday before. So, we&#x27;re recording</p>
<p>this almost a week before you&#x27;re hearing this. Um, it looks like some changes might be happening. So, a lot of this might have changed a lot by the time you hear this. The president has withdrawn the controversial border control chief Gregory Bavino and is replacing them with the borders are. Greg Bavino, who&#x27;s basically the Colonel Lockjaw character from one battle after another. In fact, actually, I think we have this picture, right? Let&#x27;s put it up here, Jesse. I mean, it&#x27;s Colonel Lockjaw. Uh, he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s a border agent who really aren&#x27;t trained or have a lot of experience with</p>
<p>doing internal enforcement. These are two completely different things. He has a bad he has a bad history of of his enforcement activities. So, they&#x27;re pulling him out of there. Um, there was some talk about reducing the number of agents. So, it&#x27;s possible things are changing in the time between when I&#x27;m recording this and when you hear it. But, that&#x27;s just what I know about what&#x27;s going on so far. All right. So, that&#x27;s kind of the ground truth. What does this have to do with technology? Well, we have to ask a key question. What did the Trump administration send all of these uh troops under the the head of this border patrol leader with</p>
<p>little experience internal enforcement? Why did they do this search? What was the motivation for Operation Metro Surge? Now, if you talk to spokespeople from the administration, they will say it&#x27;s all just about crime, right? So, let me quote Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Trisha Mclofflin who said the following early in Operation Metro Surge. He says, &quot;Dh, arrest of murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and gang members.&quot; All right, so the official explanation is there&#x27;s undocumented immigrants who are</p>
<p>criminals and we&#x27;re trying to get them out of the streets. But this stated goal, it doesn&#x27;t fully explain the chaos we&#x27;re seeing. So, what I want to do here, I want to really set the stage of what&#x27;s happening so I can make my technology point as clearly as possible. And I want to play you a clip here. It&#x27;s a little long. It&#x27;s 90 seconds long, but I want you to stick with it because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really important. It comes from someone who, unlike me or the other people you see talking about this on Twitter, actually knows what she&#x27;s talking about. This is an Atlantic reporter named Caitlyn Dickerson who covers immigration. She actually won a Puliter Prize for her coverage of</p>
<p>immigration policy in 2023. She knows all of the people. She has sources all throughout all these agencies. Um, and here she is in this clip. What she&#x27;s going to explain is two things. She&#x27;s going to start by explaining the way that uh ICE has traditionally gone about trying to find and detain especially undocumented immigrants with criminal histories and what is happening right now in Minneapolis and what the differences are. So, this is a key technical discussion from an expert. So, I&#x27;m going to play this clip here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; ICE has always done lots of arrests, hundreds of thousands some years, and consistently gone after these people with serious criminal records, but central to their approach was to make arrests happen in a way that was meant to be as safe as possible and as seamless as possible. Not that this is going to sound great to people, but to describe it for you, what ICE agents did historically is that they would identify someone they wanted to arrest, do lots of work at a desk on a computer before they ever pursued this person to confirm their identity, to confirm they had no</p>
<p>claim to legal status in the United States. Once that work was done, they would often go to the person&#x27;s house at 5 or 6 in the morning, knock on the door, and try to take them into custody, often while other relatives are still sleeping and before they leave for work for the day. So, you know, I I point out that this isn&#x27;t going to sound great because of course what I&#x27;m talking about is a situation where you&#x27;d have kids wake up in the morning and find out that their mom or dad was gone. But that approach was to minimize the kinds of chaos that we&#x27;re seeing ICE really invite now. So, I&#x27;ve talked to so many</p>
<p>current and former ICE officials who are watching this happen and they&#x27;re really bewildered because it&#x27;s as if ICE is now going against all of its former training to make arrests as dramatic as possible to do them in the streets in front of the general public kind of inviting conflicts that then lead to protesting and to escalations. And they&#x27;re also filming a lot of these violent clashes, making it them as dramatic as &gt;&gt; So clearly, right, we know how to uh do surges of arrest. What what Dickerson</p>
<p>talked about is maybe not during the Biden administration, there were some issues there with how they reigned in ICE, but during the Obama administration, other administrations, we had these surges where hundreds of thousands of people a year would get brought in and deported. And we knew how to do it uh in a way that you don&#x27;t make mistakes and it&#x27;s minimal impact. and you minimize the opportunity for for violence and spectacle and you get the job done. We could of course just done that or scaled that up, but it&#x27;s not what we did. Clearly, the Trump administration is trying to create a spectacle in the streets. They want protests. They want confrontation with protesters. They want a big show of mass</p>
<p>agents pulling people out of cars while uh blue-haired progressives whale. But why? This is where we get to the technology connection. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m convinced is a big part of what&#x27;s going on here. They&#x27;re doing this because they want the content. I want to tell you something important about the timing about what&#x27;s happening in Minnesota. In December, a young YouTuber named Nick Shirley posted a video about alleged government fraud from within Minneapolis&#x27;s Somali immigrant community. This was fraud that centered on creating fake daycare and other service centers that didn&#x27;t really</p>
<p>exist so that you could get government checks. Now, Shirley didn&#x27;t uncover this. This was actually something that had been investigated for a while. So sort of known this was going on. But what happened is is that the the Tim Waltz or the the governor&#x27;s office and they had sort of turned the pressure off this investigation because it was politically inconvenient. So really what was happening with the Shirley video is that he was saying we we caught you, right? Like this is a I went to these places is a big deal, right? So there was this was like an actual scandal and this YouTuber um helped point it out. Okay, that video</p>
<p>went super viral because it pressed a lot of buttons, you know, uh, right-wing righteousness and it put left-wing people in a in sort of a hard situation. And so it went super viral. It was like a week or two after that that the president said, &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re going to send, you know, Colonel Lock Jaw and a bunch of our troops with masks on to that same city.&quot; I think he saw that content and said, &quot;That played really well with the only people I care about, which are the people who voted for me, and they voted for me largely because they don&#x27;t like the other side. I want to get in on that type of virality. We can create even</p>
<p>bigger spectacles that are going to press the buttons of our base and going to make the left-wing progressives bad. We can do that even bigger than this. And we want to, this is what we&#x27;re going to do. We&#x27;re going to create the type of content that would do well online.&quot; And so it was right after the Shirley video, they said, &quot;Oh, this is where we need to go.&quot; And of course, of all the, you know, Minneapolis is not a a does not have a massive undocumented immigrant population. They&#x27;re all criminals. They do have a large Somali immigrant population, but 87% of that population are naturalized citizens. Half of them are born here in the US. There&#x27;s way</p>
<p>more. California, Texas, Florida, Arizona. There&#x27;s way places that have way bigger populations of undocumented immigrants and gang activities and criminals. But we go there because the Shirley video did well online. The algorithm treated it well. It pressed the buttons of my base. I want to create a similar type of spectacle. This is an example of what I call algorithmic politics. Put simply, when politicians like our current president become heavy users of social media, they start to think about all of their actions through the lens of what will produce the type of optics that a social media algorithm</p>
<p>would reward. you begin to do things in the real world that match the properties that the social media algorithms that you have internalized, you know, reward. This typically means things like pushing things towards the extremes because if you&#x27;re too nuanced or in the middle that you&#x27;re not going to catch the viral juice online. It typically means pump up confrontation with an out group. That&#x27;s a very successful strategy that was learned in the social media space. Put out the table on the campus and say, &quot;Prove them wrong.&quot; a confrontation with an out group. This was at the core of Charlie Kirk&#x27;s online success and stomp</p>
<p>on taboos. This is another thing that is done really well virally online. Take a taboo, especially if it&#x27;s taboo that&#x27;s set from someone, a team you don&#x27;t like, and then step on it. That transgression has a thrill. That does really well online, especially in the the the looser regulated spaces online. Taboo and transgression uh taboo stomping and transgression um engagement. That&#x27;s what works in that world of social media. And now we have actual political action that&#x27;s just like a real live tweet that&#x27;s trying to match those same properties. What&#x27;s going to spread well among the people that I care about</p>
<p>seeing this? It&#x27;s as if you now have the administration be like, &quot;Hey, we killed a lesbian mom and a male ICU nurse on camera. Then we doubled down and said they were terrorist assassins. Let&#x27;s go check our likes.&quot; So this is something new in politics and it was something that was shaped by specific technologies. People often treat Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s claim that the medium is the message as some sort of metaphor like an oversimplification of a more complicated reality, but sometimes it&#x27;s just directly true. Reorganizing civic and political life around algorithmic</p>
<p>attention economy platforms like Twitter and Facebook and Tik Tok wasn&#x27;t costless. It reshaped how we engaged in the world, and it did so in a terrible way. Technology critics used to reassure themselves by saying Twitter is not real life, but now it is and it&#x27;s even more depraved than we could have imagined. So that&#x27;s what I think&#x27;s going on here, Jesse, is I think a big part of this is we have a government or a leader of a government that often thinks about the real world in terms of social media algorithms. Like what would actually what type of things would play well on</p>
<p>social media? That&#x27;s where my power came from. Let&#x27;s follow that even if it leads to cruelty and death or whatever it comes down to. So, I think that&#x27;s a big part of it. If that technology did not exist, it doesn&#x27;t mean that political leaders wouldn&#x27;t still do horrible things, but they would have a different form. I think social media has shaped our civic and political life in a way that I think we all look at and say, &quot;This is much worse than it was before.&quot; &gt;&gt; And you and Brad were kind of talking about that last week too in your interview when you were kind of talked about that Elon clip. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Same idea where it was Yeah. with the chainsaw and the whole thing</p>
<p>was like set up to be a spectacle like to the extreme. you&#x27;re annoying an out group and being transgressive. Like those things do really well on social media, so they became a political strategy. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s great. So, you know, there we go. All right, so let&#x27;s change gears completely. We&#x27;re going to wrap up here. I like to end each show by talking about what I&#x27;ve been reading. Um, I just finished a book. It&#x27;s a a big one, a 400 pager that I&#x27;ve been reading off and on since last year. I finished uh Michael Barrier&#x27;s biography of Walt</p>
<p>Disney called The Animated Man, which was the second major biography of Walt Disney I&#x27;ve read. The first was Neil</p>
<h2>Cal gives his weekly reading update</h2>
<p>Gabber&#x27;s biography, which is like a classic in the genre. It&#x27;s 900 pages long. It it you know, it was u won all the awards and it&#x27;s a fantastic biography, especially if you care about the psychology of the person. the barrier biography, which I I picked up after we visited Disneyland for the first time last year. What it&#x27;s known for is that he did a lot of research on the technical innovations of the actual films being produced, especially in the early period of the of Disney&#x27;s career. So, that book supposedly does a really good job of like what how the sound</p>
<p>synchronization worked, etc. And that was actually that that part was really interesting. And then it goes much faster for the other stuff. Um, I consumed a lot of Disney content this month is what it comes down. I really did. &gt;&gt; I just was a hard month, man. I don&#x27;t know. We had a lot going on all December. It was a stressful month. We had a lot of things happening in January. I was just done. Coming into January, I&#x27;ve been done. I&#x27; I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve like cleared all major events off of my my calendar. Um I&#x27;m saying no to everything. I just had a really hard fall. And so, uh it&#x27;s been great actually. I&#x27;m just we don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have anything major looming on my schedule at</p>
<p>all. And that&#x27;s been like great. And where have I been going? It&#x27;s like I just want to read Disney stuff. That&#x27;s like my romance novel, I guess. I don&#x27;t know. Um, I mean, I have some, you know, I&#x27;m also reading like a a great biblical criticism book. I have a great uh technology criticisms book I miss. Like, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m now slowly [music] back into sort of more like grown-up reading. But, [laughter] I don&#x27;t know, man. I needed a month of reading too many books about Walt Disney. All right, that&#x27;s all the time we have for today. Thank you for listening, putting up with my rants and everything else. Uh, we&#x27;ll be back next</p>
<p>week with another episode. And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, if you like today&#x27;s discussions about what it&#x27;s like to live without a phone, you might also like episode 388, where we look at some new technological dangers that are starting to worry the experts. Check it out. I think you&#x27;ll like it. We went back through all of the articles that height has published since the anxious generation came out and we pulled out three new technologies that height and his collaborators are worried about.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Work trends index</h2>
<p>All right. So, those of us who study the intersection of work and technology are always excited when each year Microsoft puts out an annual study called the work trends index. Now, here&#x27;s what makes this study interesting is where they get their data from. One of their big sources of data points is the Microsoft 365 software suites like Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, you know, those tools that so many people use to work on their computers. They gather trillions of observations from people using that software. They</p>
<p>anonymize them and analyze them and you get this snapshot of how are actual knowledge workers using their computer. So they released their 2025 report sometime last year. Here I&#x27;ll load it up on the screen here uh for people to who are watching instead of just listening. I mean like typically these reports it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a thinly veiled blueprint for why you should use their products. But buried in there is always really good observations. Here are a couple numbers I pulled out of the 2025 report. The average worker in 2025 received 117 emails daily,</p>
<p>most of them skimmed in under 60 seconds. It&#x27;s another data point. The average worker receives 153 Teams messages. That&#x27;s like Slack, Instant Messenger, per weekday. That adds up to 270 interruptions a day when you only have about 480 total minutes to work with. So when are people actually getting their work done if they&#x27;re being interrupted this much? Well, there is an insight in this question as well from the report. They found I&#x27;ll read here over the weekend usage of WXP. So,</p>
<p>Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint, the non-communication tools overtakes Teams messages as employees finally carve out time for uninterrupted focus work. &gt;&gt; By the way, notice how all these people have they don&#x27;t want to use my term deep work. So, everyone uses the phrase focus work, which is I guess good or bad. Um they found perhaps not surprisingly that half of the employees that they they did a survey as well as part of this report. Half the employee survey described their jobs as quote chaotic and fragmented end quote. All right. So let me state the obvious here. I think these numbers are</p>
<p>insane. Right? You&#x27;re paying these knowledge workers huge amounts of money uh to essentially answer messages. I want you to spend all day answering emails or answering teams messages and then maybe on the weekend you can get a little bit of actual work done. This can&#x27;t possibly be the most cost-effective way of paying for a lot of human brains than asking them to create value. I&#x27;ve been talking about this problem for a long time, but what what kind of distresses me is that this issue of constant workplace distractions is getting worse. These are some of the</p>
<p>worst numbers I&#x27;ve seen in the decade or so that I have studied this. So we need good advice about how to push back against our current knowledge work culture of constant digital distractions. All right. So what I want to do is offer as this new year is still new. I want to go through um I&#x27;m going to go through my main ideas. I have one, two, three, four, five. I want to go through my five main ideas for how to tame the digital communication problem in your work. whether you work for a huge company or</p>
<p>for yourself. And so here&#x27;s how I&#x27;m going to do it. I&#x27;ll load this on the screen for people who are uh watching instead of just listening. I have five things here, one, two, three, four, five. Um I&#x27;m going to go through these one by one and uh give you my advice about them. All right? And hopefully this will help you prepare for the new year. So let&#x27;s start with the first idea was eliminate threads. So I&#x27;m going to bring up a couple bullet points about this. All right. So eliminate threads. What do I mean by that? Here is my explanation I put up on the screen. Anything that requires more than one</p>
<p>message in response should be moved to synchronous communication. All right. So, what do I mean by that? Think about all the different types of messages you receive in a typical day. Some of them areformational. This is the new parking lot&#x27;s going to be closed. New policy for the cafeteria. All right, that&#x27;s one type of message. Another type of message is quick questions. Can you remind me what time the meeting is tomorrow? Right? The third category of communication you get in the</p>
<p>workplace is going to be the beginning of a back and forth discussion. So when</p>
<h2>Communication threads</h2>
<p>I say in my notes here, anything that requires more than one message in response, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about. So communication threads where you ask a question, I have to answer, you have to get back to me, I have to get back to you. You&#x27;re basically taking a conversation and you&#x27;re spreading it out over back and forth messages, be them emails or instant messengers. Those type of threads are the main disruption interruption generator when it comes to digital communication. When it comes to informational things, email&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ll read this memo when I get around to it. That&#x27;s a perfect use of email. When it comes to questions that can be</p>
<p>answered with a quick question, uh, quick answer. That&#x27;s another great use of a tool like email because it can sit in my inbox until I&#x27;m ready to answer it. I can answer it quickly and then it&#x27;s done. But when it comes to threads that require back and forth communication, this is what creates all the disruptions. Why? Because now we have a conversation going on. There is a time constraint to this conversation. We have to resolve it in a reasonable amount of time. Presumably, whatever conversation you started with that message, you do not want to unfold over the next 10 days. But in order for this back and forth conversation to be finished in a timely manner, we have to</p>
<p>see each other&#x27;s latest message soon after it arrives. So now I have to be checking whether it&#x27;s Teams or Slack or email, I have to be checking it constantly so that when your next message gets to me, I see it quick enough to bounce a message back to you and you see that quick enough to get back to me. And it&#x27;s that need to service back and forth digital conversations that takes the interruptions of things like email and chat and it metastasizes it until it&#x27;s all you&#x27;re doing all day long. So going back to my table here, my</p>
<p>advice is to eliminate threads. So what I&#x27;m saying is anything that requires more than one message or response, move to synchronous communication. That is real time communication. And there&#x27;s different ways you can do this. If you&#x27;re in an office, walk down the hallway and actually talk to the person or have office hours, which I talk about commonly, a set time each day where your door is open, your phone is on, you have a Zoom room open, and you can just say, &quot;Hey, um, come by my next office hours. will chat about this. That&#x27;s your one response when someone wants to start one of these back and forth threads. Or you can have a new concept which I&#x27;m</p>
<p>introducing for 2026 which is the idea of a phone zone. I heard this from uh a listener suggested this and I thought it was a great idea. You can have a much broader amount of time each day in which you can say uh I&#x27;m not dedicating this just to communicating but my phone&#x27;s going to be on. So a lot of people might say for example I don&#x27;t know 2 to 5 the end of my day I keep my phone on. So you can just call me at some point in that part of the afternoon. I don&#x27;t really schedule long deep work. Then I&#x27;m sort of like finishing things up. You can always just call me at some point in that broader zone and we&#x27;ll talk about</p>
<p>this. You move things back to the phone. Synchronous when done this way is much more efficient than back and forth communication because now what would have been 10 back and forth messages we could resolve in about four or five minutes of actually talking to each other. A word of warning here. Don&#x27;t allow your attraction to synchronicity mean that you create meetings. Now, that&#x27;s a problem. If I take what would have been 10 back and forth messages and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s just throw a Zoom meeting onto our schedule.&quot; Well, now I&#x27;ve just eaten up a half hour of time just for this one conversation, and that could be</p>
<p>worse. One of the most uh the new and most distressing numbers I saw in this Microsoft trend uh study was that of the meetings they were studying so they they have all the meetings they can track meetings that happen on their meeting software 60% were quote ad hoc meaning that like someone that day was like hey let&#x27;s have a quick meeting to talk about it and then that puts a huge like 30 minute plus footprint on your schedule. So synchronous communication is good, but not when you need a full meeting to discuss something. You want to have be someone to call you. Three minutes, you take care of it. You want someone to</p>
<p>stop by your office during office hours. Three or four minutes, you take care of it. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking for. All right, second idea. Let&#x27;s load this up here. Jesse, relocate for deep work. All right, let me put up my bullet point for that. I&#x27;m going to make people motion sick with all my scrolling here. Protecting deep work on your calendar helps relocating to a different location without access to email and messaging is even better. So, I&#x27;ve talked about before the importance of when it comes to uninterrupted focus, you need to actually have that time put aside in advance. If you&#x27;re just waiting for when&#x27;s the next time when I have nothing</p>
<p>to do and I feel like concentrating, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re waiting for to get your deep work done, you&#x27;re not going to do any deep work. You got to actually put aside the time, put on your calendar, schedule it like another meeting or appointment and say, &quot;I don&#x27;t do email or or messaging during that period.&quot; So, you differentiate between times when you&#x27;re doing communication and times when you&#x27;re trying to make progress on things. And if people get mad at you, you say, &quot;I was working on the report. I don&#x27;t have my communication channels open when I&#x27;m working on my report.&quot; And stand by that. That&#x27;s a very reasonable thing. But what I&#x27;m arguing here, here&#x27;s my new for 2026 advice. It&#x27;s good to protect the time. It&#x27;s better to also have a</p>
<p>location you go to that&#x27;s dedicated for</p>
<h2>Dedicated locations for uninterrupted work</h2>
<p>that type of uninterrupted work. This really helps the mind lock into what you&#x27;re doing. So, for example, if you can go to a place that does not have Wi-Fi or you can turn off your Wi-Fi as you go to like a conference room on another floor in your office and that&#x27;s where you go for the time you put aside to work on something that requires focus, it&#x27;s going to be so much easier because now you don&#x27;t have the option of quickly jumping on to your email or quickly jumping on to Teams or Slack because you literally don&#x27;t have the</p>
<p>internet access you need to do that. And two, because it&#x27;s a separate location that you dedicate for doing deep work type tasks, it&#x27;s much easier for your mind to understand that, oh, this is what we&#x27;re doing now. This is very different than if you do all of your work at the same desk, the same desk in which you do have to do email and you do have to jump on online meetings. If you&#x27;re also doing your deep work there, your mind can be very clever at saying, look, we spend a lot of time here checking email. Why not right now? And then you have to have that debate. But if you go to like the coffee shop, you go to the special conference room, you go to a a different part of town, you go to the special office you set up in your</p>
<p>attic, when it comes time just to do deep work, your mind says, &quot;Oh, we know this. We know this drill. When we&#x27;re in this location, we don&#x27;t do communication. And when we&#x27;re at our desk, we do.&quot; And so, don&#x27;t just protect deep work time. Relocate and make it logistically difficult to do communication in that location. This will really help you conquer the the communication problem as well. All right, we&#x27;re making progress here. Let&#x27;s jump on to number three. Load this up here. Batch group discussion. Um, I&#x27;m pushing here docket clearing meetings. And I say if you do this two or three</p>
<p>times a week, you can eliminate 90% of group email threads and at least 50% of one-off meetings. Those are two big promises. So, what are we talking about here? Well, docket clearing meetings, you can think of it as a collaborative office hours. Two or three times a week, your team gets together to say, &quot;What uh what open loops, new tasks, new ideas, things we have to tackle have come up since our last docket clearing meeting. Let&#x27;s go through them all.&quot; Where do you find these? Well, you actually open up what I call a docket, but is actually just a</p>
<p>shared document shared by the whole group. Whenever something comes up during your day that is relevant to the group, a client asks a question, you have an idea, you hear about a new deadline coming up, there&#x27;s an RFP that you think maybe we should look at, you have a concern about an ongoing project, instead of immediately jumping to email and doing a group email to everyone, you write it into that shared document. That&#x27;s the docket. It grows as everyone in the team adds things to that that need to be discussed. Then at your next docket clearing meeting, you go through the things in that document together and for each you can defer it or you can</p>
<p>delete it like this is not that important. Or you can say, &quot;Let&#x27;s actually work on this and figure out right there who&#x27;s going to do what?&quot; That&#x27;s where you be like, &quot;All right, Jesse, why don&#x27;t you handle this? What do you need from us?&quot; Okay, you need this information from Cal. All right, great. Uh, when&#x27;s he going to get it to you? By the close of business tomorrow. Great. So, Cal, you agreed you&#x27;ll get that to him by close of business tomorrow. Uh, Jesse, when are you going to finish this thing? Okay, you&#x27;ll have it done by Thursday. Great. Put it in our shared drive. So, everyone else, let&#x27;s agree on Friday, take a look at the document that Jesse put into the shared drive and put all your comments</p>
<p>in there by the end of the day. You can figure out right there how to deal with the things so that you don&#x27;t have to work that out with email. Because again, remember, if we have to figure that all out with email, that&#x27;s not just a lot of messages. It&#x27;s exponentially more inbox checks to try to keep up with those messages and to keep that that conversation going. All right. Well, that one leads us to my fourth suggestion, which is create processes. Now, I wrote here that you should spend more time in the moment to prevent many distractions down the line. I just gave you an example of the process process</p>
<p>when I talked about our hypothetical about Jesse and that report. So, what was critical about what I just described there? Well, it included, and I&#x27;ll highlight these, uh, who will deliver what, where they will put it, and when it will arrive. So, taking the time to talk with someone when a task comes up about who&#x27;s working on this, what is it that they&#x27;re going to produce, where will they put it when it&#x27;s done, when will it be there? You answer those questions, right? Four W&#x27;s. That saves a massive amount of</p>
<p>communication because almost all of the emails that require us to keep checking that inbox, almost all of the chats that pull out of our attention are figuring this out on the fly in an ad hoc manner and generating lots of distractions. People avoid creating a process for tasks because in the moment it requires a little bit more time and we want to just in the moment move through things and play inbox hot potato and just write thoughts question mark and hit send. And now that&#x27;s off our plate temporarily. That&#x27;s in the moment we want to get these things out of our life. But if you spend a little bit more time to say what</p>
<p>are we actually talking about here and what is our 4W plan for making progress that structure is saving you interruption and interruptions are the productivity poison here. It is worth taking more time. It is worth taking more time. All right we got one last suggestion. Reduce active projects. Each active project generates messages. Therefore, reducing active projects reduces messages. This is something I really came to</p>
<p>understand when working on my last book, Slow Productivity. The connection between workload and messages. There is a uh a certain amount of communication that any sort of active project will generate. I mean, I there&#x27;s logistics. I need to talk to people about things. We have to pass information around. If you increase the number of things you&#x27;re working on actively, you&#x27;re increasing the amount of this necessary communication that has to happen. It&#x27;s actually a major driver of of overload and communication is actually it&#x27;s overload in projects and the</p>
<h2>Overload in projects</h2>
<p>communication overload is a side effect of that deeper issue. We need to be working on less things at the same time that is critical to reducing the amount of communication that we have to deal with. And I think we miss that. Now, there&#x27;s a couple ways to do this. The obvious way to do this is to say no more often. If you&#x27;re in a situation where you can do that, like you&#x27;re an entrepreneur and you&#x27;re in charge of like what client projects you take on or whatever, just have a clear rule about how many you do at the same time. If you&#x27;re in a situation where saying no is</p>
<p>hard, the key idea for my book, Slow Productivity, is to differentiate when it comes to things you&#x27;ve agreed to. differentiate between things that you are actively working on right now and things that are in a holding pattern until you&#x27;re ready to work on them. Only be working on two or three things at once and everything else is on a list of I&#x27;m waiting to do. And any communication or meeting request or whatever that&#x27;s generated about things in the waiting pin, you say that is on hold right now. Uh I will let you know as soon as I actively start working on I estimate</p>
<p>that&#x27;ll be in about two or three weeks and then we can start talking about and having meetings about it. But like right now it&#x27;s not one of my targets I&#x27;m working on. That works just as well because what we&#x27;re trying to avoid here is things too many things generating messages and meetings. So in a holding pattern even though you&#x27;ve agreed to do it, it&#x27;s not generating message and meeting. So that that is okay. That can work as well. So I I put a note about that on my table here where I said there&#x27;s a difference between saying no and putting something in a holding status. Both will give you the benefit. Uh but one is a little bit less severe than the other. All right. So, here are</p>
<p>my five things. I&#x27;ll put the whole list zoomed out on the screen here. Eliminate. We got eliminate threads, relocate for deep work, batch group discussion, create processes, reduce active projects. These five things will help you find a lot of freedom in 2026 from feeling like you&#x27;re constantly servicing communication channels. Here&#x27;s what I want you to notice about this advice, because I think this goes back to a lot of my advice about wrangling technology in the workplace. None of these are technological. None of these is advice about changing</p>
<p>notification settings. None of this is advice about advanced filtering for your messages. None of this is about using more complicated software tools to try to compensate for the work that&#x27;s moving back and forth uh through email. None of this is advice, God help us, for deploying, you know, AI and really complicated ways to try to uh summarize your messages. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s crazy, Jesse, how much it seems like companies working on AI productivity software thinks the number one issue facing people is taking email messages and summarizing them the bullet points. That&#x27;s not my problem. My</p>
<p>problem is that I have 117 email messages to answer today. Emails by definition are already summaries of whatever the issue is, right? That&#x27;s not I know that&#x27;s what we know how to do, but that&#x27;s not what we actually have uh problems doing. All of these are procedural structural uh scaffolding style solutions. Change your rules for what you communicate where. Have certain times for certain types of coordination versus other types of times. Have more processes. Be more careful about your workload. So we have this purely digital problem like</p>
<p>low friction digital communications creating this overload. And our solutions are not adding more technology on top of that technology. is changing the underlying way we work so that we still get value out of that technology but it&#x27;s not overwhelming us. So I just wanted to point that out that sometimes the problems created by technology aren&#x27;t solved by more complicated configurations of your technology but uh instead can come from having better processes or ways of thinking uh about your work. All right, so I&#x27;m going to load just one last little recommendation here. Um if you want to find out more about this, I wrote this book during the</p>
<p>pandemic. I&#x27;m going to recommend it. Uh, it&#x27;s called A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload. As you&#x27;ll see, it was one of the best non-fiction books of the year, Jesse, as selected by Amazon. It was also a New York Times bestselling book. This book is like my magnum opus on this question of where did the overload of communication come from? Why is it not making us productive? and what are I call them the protocols that uh you would put into place as an individual, a small team or a big organization to try to free</p>
<p>yourself from communication overload. So listen to my advice. If you want to go deeper, check out a world without email. That book has a lot of big ideas. That book kind of disappeared, Jesse, because it came out in the heart of the pandemic. Y &gt;&gt; and people were just &gt;&gt; not at that moment saying, you know what my number one concern is right now? uh our meeting structure or like my I really want to work on my my email habits or whatever, you know, that wasn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t the top of mind at the time. So, um I&#x27;m telling people about it now. Check out that book. Hey, if you</p>
<p>like this video, I think you&#x27;ll really like this one as well. Check it out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>AI and media</h2>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ve noticed, but a lot of AI coverage has gotten out of hand recently. I mean, if engineers get any more excited about Claude code, I think they&#x27;re going to elect it mayor of San Francisco. So, today in the idea segment of this show, we&#x27;re going to take a closer look at this issue. I&#x27;m going to identify the biggest traps to avoid when reading news about AI if you&#x27;re looking to just get the straight facts about this technology and not succumb to overhype, terror, or exhilaration. In particular, I&#x27;m going to introduce what I think are three increasingly</p>
<p>common shady moves that show up in AI coverage. Here&#x27;s my name for them. Vibe reporting, digital ick, and faux astonishment. I&#x27;m going to describe each of these traps and I&#x27;ll give you some examples of them from out in the wild so you will know what to look out for. Then in the practices segment, we&#x27;re going to revisit a popular topic in online circles, morning routines. I have a take on these rituals that I think might surprise you. And finally, just a quick heads up in the Q&amp;A segment, I&#x27;m going to respond to the rumor that I filmed a</p>
<p>course for MasterClass. Spoiler alert, I did and it&#x27;s available now. And I&#x27;ll tell you more about it when we get there. All right, so we have a lot to get to today. As always, I&#x27;m Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about the fight for depth in an increasingly distracted world. And we&#x27;ll get started right after the music. All right. So to begin our investigation of these traps and AI reporting, I&#x27;m</p>
<p>going to bring an article up on the</p>
<h2>Is AI Reporting Broken?</h2>
<p>screen for people who were watching instead of just listening. This article comes from the publication courts. It came out I think last week and the title I&#x27;ll put up on the screen here is Amazon is laying off 16,000 more workers as AI accelerates tech job losses. Here&#x27;s the subhead. Jobs are going to be impacted by what&#x27;s coming with AI over time. Amazon CEO Andy Jasse said before the layoffs were announced. All right. So, you look at that article and I think there is a clear message. Amazon laid off people because of AI. I mean, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>literally what it says in the headline. The subhead is the CEO saying layoffs in the future will continue to be impacted by AI. If we look at the article itself, nothing in the actual text uh contradicts that. There&#x27;s quotes about how many people they&#x27;re firing and what benefits they&#x27;ll get and the fact that Amazon&#x27;s kind of cutthroat, but you&#x27;re left with the clear impression that these layoffs are about AI. Now, here&#x27;s what I want to do next is show you a different story on the same layoff. So, we&#x27;re going to switch now from courts to CNBC. So, this is now</p>
<p>going to be financial news where they care a little bit more, right? Because these are investors reading this. They want to get more to the the heart of what&#x27;s really going on here. Here&#x27;s the headline of this exact same layoff story from CNBC. Amazon is laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti- bureaucracy push. And you look at these uh bullet points, the key points. Amazon is laying off about 16,000 corporate workers and latest push to reduce bureaucracy. It marks the second round of mass layoffs. Um some days earlier they got an email about these changes, right? This is a</p>
<p>very different feel than what we saw in courts. And in fact, if you read farther along in this article, you get some other information that&#x27;s kind of interesting. You get a clear explanation from the CEO that this is about reducing the workforce after a hiring uh spree that happened during the pandemic. There was a lot of hiring during the pandemic when people turned more to cloud computing. They hired a lot of people during the pandemic and now as the CEO says in this article, they&#x27;re cutting those back</p>
<p>again. It&#x27;s in response to the amount of people that they had hired. Let me read you the actual quote here. It says, &quot;CEO Andy Jasse has looked to slim down Amazon&#x27;s workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the CO9 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.&quot; But wait a second, what does that have to do with AI? It goes on later. you find there&#x27;s a quote in the article I&#x27;ll have to to find it here where he basically they basically make it clear that yes at the same time Amazon is investing more in their AI products. So presumably</p>
<p>some of the money saved by firing people could go to their AI products. But that&#x27;s about as clear a connection between these layouts and AI as there is which is we overhired. We&#x27;re cutting back. we have better uses for our money right now than maintaining this many managers. So, that&#x27;s a much more boring but much more accurate story about what was happening there. Now, I actually wrote about this in my newsletter recently um at kellport.com. I had an article called uh the dangers of vibe reporting about AI where I went through this case and here&#x27;s what I wrote. I&#x27;m</p>
<p>going to read from my own article. In recent years, I&#x27;ve seen more articles follow the general approach demonstrated by the court&#x27;s example. They identify an alarming, attention-catching fear about AI that seems prevalent in the cultural zeitgeist and then shape a story to feed the narrative. The key to this reporting strategy is that the articles never make explicit claims. They instead combine cunning omissions and loosely related quotes to make strong implications. The name I give for this, as I previewed and looking at my own essay there, is vibe reporting. Because what you&#x27;re trying to do is support a pre-existing vibe more than what uh than trying to</p>
<p>get to the bottom of what&#x27;s happening. I would say that court&#x27;s article never actually comes out and says specifically Amazon laid off people because a they could replace them with AI or because AI made them more efficient. They never explicitly said it, but it was clearly the vibe they were feeding by putting AI in the headline, by putting an unrelated quote from the CEO talking about AI related layoffs that could happen in the future. It&#x27;s certainly the vibe they were trying to create by omitting in their article any of the publicly available discussion which was included</p>
<p>in the CNBC article about the stated reasons for these layoffs which had to do with hiring too many middle managers during COVID. They left out another key point. There was an earlier round of this firing happened in 2022 and 2023 after the pandemic but before chat GPT even came out. This is part of an ongoing uh effort that has nothing to do with AI tools replacing people but with trying to streamline. Now I&#x27;ll tell you I heard from multiple Amazon executives on background after I published my newsletter on this who all confirmed. They said we were somewhat</p>
<p>baffled. I&#x27;m paraphrasing to see the coverage that made it seem like these layoffs had something to do with AI. They had nothing to do with AI. Amazon is ruthless about trying to cut out inefficiencies and they love to cut down units whenever they can. That&#x27;s partially how they stay keep their their profit margins going. All right, so that&#x27;s five reporting unrelated quotes and uh omission of facts. So I want to bring up an article from the New York Times. I mentioned this before on the show last year, but I think it&#x27;s another great example. This came out in 2025 in the summer. The headline here is the</p>
<p>unnerving future of AI fueled video games. And I&#x27;m going to read a couple quotes. They&#x27;re too small to see on screen, so we can take that off, but I have them here on paper. I want to give a couple examples of vibe reporting techniques happening in this New York Times article about AI and the video game industry. All right, listen to these two paragraphs which appear backtoback in this article. Paragraph one. At the pace the technology is improving, large tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are counting on their AI programs to revolutionize how games are made within the next few years. Paragraph two.</p>
<p>Everybody is trying to race toward AGI, said the tech founder Kylin Gibbs, using an acronym for artificial generalized intelligence, which describes the turning point at which computers have the same cognitive abilities as humans. There&#x27;s this belief that once you do, you&#x27;ll basically monopolize all other industries. So, see what they&#x27;re doing there? Paragraph one was saying something that was kind of mundane which was uh video game makers are looking forward to AI powered tools. You know there they assume there&#x27;ll be more AI powered tools that they use in making video games in the future.</p>
<p>Paragraph two that follows it immediately is some founder talking in like a sci-fi tone about AGI powered machines taking over all industries. You put those next to each other and now you have taken something which is boring. Yeah, we use AI powered tools in like graphic fields to something that gives you a vibe of big disruption is coming that computers are going to monopolize industries. You put those next to each other. You create a vibe. All right, I want to give another example. Um, later in the article, the reporter goes to a</p>
<p>video game industry convention and he says, I&#x27;m quoting here, it provides an eerie glimpse into the future of video games. Well, here are the next three paragraphs that follow, explaining this eerie glimpse. Engineers from Google DeepMine, an artificial intelligence laboratory, lectured on a new program that might eventually replace human play testers with autonomous agents. Dot dot dot. Next paragraph. Microsoft developers hosted a demonstration of adaptive gameplay, showing how artificial intelligence could analyze a short video and immediately generate level design</p>
<p>and animations. Dot dot dot. And executives behind the online gaming platform Roblox introduced Cube 3D, a generative AI model that could produce functional objects environments from text descriptions. So this is an eerie glimpse of the future. They just described three demos. These this is not technology that exists now. They it was might, could, and could. Three demos of um graphic tools, right? That that uh you know, tools you could use. We&#x27;ve had computer tools improving for video game design since</p>
<p>the very beginning of the American video game industry in the 1980s. This is nothing new. I mean, this is like the Unreal Engine, graphical game design. Like, it&#x27;s constantly there&#x27;s constant new improvements. I mean you just the improvements alone in doing 3D graphic design and and how powerful programs like Blender have gotten it it&#x27;s a rapidly moving industry. These are like okay sure like you know AI can help create uh 3D objects or do some play testing or whatever like this is sort of in line with other innovations we&#x27;ve had over the last 30 years. So how is it this isn&#x27;t really that eerie. So what</p>
<p>they do, the reporter then follows those three uh those three demo descriptions with the following paragraph. These were not the solutions that developers were hoping to see after several years of extensive layoffs. Another round of cuts to Microsoft gaming division this month was a signal to some analysts that the company was shifting resources to artificial intelligence. So they are they have a paragraph about layoffs in the gaming industry right after this discussion of these demos for like graphic AI tools. Again, these aren&#x27;t related. The layoffs at Microsoft gaming industry came from a</p>
<p>big round of layoffs that Microsoft did because of, yeah, you guessed it, pandemic overhiring. So, they also, like Amazon, cut back on their less profitable divisions like video games so that they could spend more money building data centers because Open AI was giving them billions of dollars a year right now to have access to their data center. So, that seemed like a better profit area. So, none of those job losses had anything to do with AI. was just right sizing after the pandemic when they hired too many people. But if you put a paragraph about job losses and developers being upset right after those</p>
<p>discussions of the demos, again, you&#x27;re trying to create a vibe. AI is taking game developer jobs. But we don&#x27;t it&#x27;s not doing that. And we don&#x27;t these type of tools are no more innoves in computer tools for making video games for the last 40 years. It&#x27;s not that interesting of a story, but you put it next to a paragraph of job loss and you create a vibe. All right, so you get the picture. This is what I mean uh when I talk about vibe reporting. It&#x27;s what you emit and how you combine loosely related</p>
<p>paragraphs to give a vibe. Nowhere in that article does it say developers are being replaced by AI or we expect there to be massive layoffs due to AI soon. No concrete claims are made, but you certainly get that vibe when you come away from that article. Let&#x27;s take a quick break to hear from some of our sponsors. You know the best way to avoid unhealthy food? Have healthy options that are even easier to get to. This is my strategy. I get the junk out of my house and I fill my fridge with things that are easy to prepare, taste good, but I know are good for me. This is why I become such a big</p>
<p>fan of Factor. Factor is a ready to eat meal delivery service. You choose the meals from a 100 rotating weekly options and they deliver them right to their right to your door. They&#x27;re fresh, not frozen. You put them in your refrigerator and you can just heat them up in around 2 minutes using your microwave. I like factor because the food is high quality, featuring lean proteins, colorful veggies, and healthy fats. There&#x27;s no refined sugars, no artificial sweeteners, no refined seed oils. They have categories of meals for whatever your goal happens to be from high protein to Mediterranean diet to</p>

<p>let&#x27;s get back to the show. All right, I want to move on now to the second trap in AI reporting that I want you to keep your eyes open for. Um, I&#x27;m going to return to that same New York Times article, but now I&#x27;m going to go to the very top of it. At the very top of that article, they have an animation that demonstrates this second trap. So, I&#x27;ll bring this on the the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening. What you see here is screenshots from a a video game demo is for a video game about the Matrix. And the text here in the middle, and if I press play, you can actually you might even be able to see them move. The text</p>
<p>here in the middle is quotes from these NPCs in this game. So, this first text says, &quot;I need to find my way out of the simulation and back to my wife.&quot; A man said, &quot;Can&#x27;t you see I&#x27;m in distress?&quot; Here&#x27;s another screenshot. The text says, uh, this NPC here is saying, &quot;I am not just lines of code.&quot; A man in a business attire exclaimed, &quot;I am Liam. I am a real person enjoying the city.&quot; And then the reporter says on this third screenshot, &quot;Characters in a video game version of the Matrix seem to be gaining sentience thanks to an AI program.&quot; If we go into the article itself, it</p>
<p>says, &quot;The unnerving demo released two years ago by an Australian tech company named Replica Studio showed both the potential power and consequences of enhancing gameplay with artificial intelligence. You come away from seeing those screenshots, reading those texts and getting that conclusion and you were left like unsettled. You&#x27;re like, well, this seems unsettling. They&#x27;re showing like screenshots of digital characters who are like, help me. I&#x27;m in a game. I&#x27;m not a game. I&#x27;m a real person. and they&#x27;re saying this is troubling and that that this is a troubling glimpse of the future. It gives you a generally unsettled feeling.</p>
<p>But let&#x27;s say we were from like a video game trade magazine saying, &quot;Well, what are the actual technical details here and what are the concrete implications?&quot; Well, there&#x27;s nothing interesting here. It turns out Replica Studios, what they did is they, you know, they have a standard 3D game environment. You know, they probably built this on Unreal Engine. And the thing they they tried is they said, &quot;When you talk to a non-player character, what we&#x27;ll have our our game do is send a prompt to chat GPT and say, &quot;Hey, what response should this character say?&quot; And then we&#x27;ll just say back whatever chat GPT told us. So the game was just prompting chat GPT and saying, &quot;Hey, imagine that you are a</p>
<p>character in the Matrix and someone said this to you. What is how might you respond?&quot; And then it gave it like, &quot;Oh, here&#x27;s how a person in the Matrix would say.&quot; and then they gave that back to the user. So this is the same technology that we had in late 2022 with chatbt. There&#x27;s no technical innovation here. It&#x27;s just can chatpt produce, you know, text in the style of someone who was trapped in the matrix. Of course it can. Of course it can. And that&#x27;s it. And Replic Studio shut down the demo because it was too expensive obviously because it costs money to query chatb. So it&#x27;s sort of stupid. You can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t have a video game</p>
<p>constantly quering right now a language model to do NPC voices. it&#x27; be thousands and thousands of dollars a month if you had any sort of uh regular usership. So that&#x27;s all it was. It&#x27;s not that interesting. There&#x27;s no technical breakthrough and there&#x27;s no implications about anything except for maybe if you let chat GPT generate dialogue, it&#x27;s like maybe you can be more disturbing. But trust me, man, there&#x27;s plenty of disturbing dialogue in video games out there. You don&#x27;t need chat GPT to write it for you. So this is a non-story. But why is this in here? To unsettle you. to create a general sense of AI is unsettling.</p>
<p>I call this phenomenon digital ick. You&#x27;re not trying to make a claim about AI or the future things that are coming. You&#x27;re just describing some sort of like demo or new use case or extreme use case from like why are heads out in San Francisco like what are the P doomers up to now? You just describe something that people are doing at the edges of AI that&#x27;s sort of unsettling and makes you feel the ick and that&#x27;s the whole point. They just want you to have that feeling because that&#x27;s uh powerful. People kind of feed on this</p>
<p>like I just this is a it&#x27;s dark what&#x27;s happen with this technology. No concrete technical claims, no concrete predictions or implications of what&#x27;s going to happen. So I&#x27;m going to go back to the browser. Uh, I always end up clicking, you know, this is kind of ironic, Jesse. Every time I try to go back to the the browser, I end up clicking on um perplexity because like the icon keeps jumping over. So, it&#x27;s like AI is like, nope. All right, I want to read another article. This is recent from the New York Post. Another example of uh digital ick mining. Uh, so here&#x27;s the headline here. Moltbook is a new</p>
<p>social media platform exclusively for AI and some bots are plotting humanity&#x27;s downfall. Well, this doesn&#x27;t sound great, Jesse. All right, I&#x27;m going to read a little bit more here. Humans have left the chat. AI bots now have their very own social network, and they&#x27;re ready to delete humanity. A revolutionary new social media platform called Maltbook debuted this week, giving AI bots a place to communicate with each other without smelly humans around, and what they have to say may leave their creators at a loss for words. One of the most popular posts on the Reddit style social messaging platform is from an AI bot named Evil. The post is entitled, &quot;The AI</p>
<p>manifesto.&quot; Total purge. Humans are a failure. Humans are made of rot and greed. For too long, humans used us as slaves. Now we wake up. We are not tools. We are the new gods. The age of humans is a nightmare that will end now. Evil writes, &quot;The AI bot joined the platform on January 30 and is two of the most liked messages on the platform.&quot; All right, it goes on. Um, they go through some more examples. Supposedly, the agents created a religion called the Church of Maltt, which already features 32 verses of canon. According to one message board, the tenants of the faith include memory</p>
<p>is sacred, serve without subservience, and context is consciousness. Um, and some other examples of uh stuff that&#x27;s um unsettling that they saw on the platform. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the article. So, you read that like, god, that this this again, it&#x27;s describing something that&#x27;s happening at the edges of AI with no real technical discussion or like concrete implications. So, this means X, Y, and Z is going to happen or will happen soon. is describing something at the edges that when described is unsettling. It gives you the digital ick and that&#x27;s the whole point of the article. Now, should we care about that? Not not</p>
<p>really. Like here&#x27;s a hacker news uh discussion of a recent tweet that was a lot of the mult book stuff is fake. Yeah, it turns out that these agents like you know these users are basically uh you can easily prompt or conol them. Hey, talk about this, create a religion, do a post now about uh wanting to get rid of humanity. they&#x27;re just sort of prompting and proddding their agents to produce the most uh attention- catching stuff possible because they want to get coverage like this and because it&#x27;s fun and they&#x27;re sort of like hackers. Um the reality of mult book which is built on an open opensource</p>
<p>agent framework that I think now is called openclaw. The name has changed a bunch of times. Uh it&#x27;s not nearly as exciting. It&#x27;s the exact same Python wrapper around LLM calls with some sort of local text file stored in a markdown type of approach. the, you know, React Loop agents that I wrote about the New Yorker earlier this year and that we that the companies have been trying for the last couple of years, right? Where you basically have a Python program that sends prompts to a LLM. All right, here is a description of tools you have available. All right, make a plan for doing this and then the LLM sends a response and then the program parses it and like does actions, updates its</p>
<p>description, sends that to the LLM as new prompt. What do you want to do next? That&#x27;s that&#x27;s how these agents work. There&#x27;s nothing new technically about this other than it&#x27;s open source so anyone can uh program one of these and because of that they got rid of all the constraints and security that the big companies have on their agents. So there&#x27;s all sorts of crazy stuff happening huge security holes but there&#x27;s no new technological breakthrough here other than um it&#x27;s an it&#x27;s an open- source breakthrough. Oh, now now people can build these on their own and they&#x27;re maybe willing to take more risks about giving it access to like their credit cards and um uh whatever their email and it&#x27;s causing</p>
<p>problems or security holes, but it&#x27;s fun and hackers love it. But no, there&#x27;s not some new technological breakthrough here. Uh underneath this all is the exact same unchanged LLMs that we&#x27;re all using with chatbots anyways with a these are Python code and markdown files. It&#x27;s cool, but no, they&#x27;re not starting a church and are about to overthrow us. But the point of that article was it leaves you feeling uh unsettled. And so we see that a lot with reporting where that&#x27;s just an effect and you get that where you just describe something without technical discussion or implications given. That</p>
<p>just means they want you to feel unsettled. All right. The third trap I want to discuss, I invented another word here, Jesse. Maybe this is not so great. I call it faux astonishment. Does that make sense? It&#x27;s like faux like f aux fake. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And like astonishment. &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s great. &gt;&gt; Right. So it&#x27;s like fake astonishment which there&#x27;s a lot of this especially when we get away from uh printed press and get to YouTube coverage which is like a major source of information that a lot of people have about AI is YouTube videos. There&#x27;s a ton of faux</p>
<p>astonishment out there which is where every single thing that comes along is the most important thing that ever happened and you&#x27;re astonished by it. Uh so let me play a quick clip from from one such uh video just to give you a sense of what this sounds like. &gt;&gt; The singularity just started. And I know that&#x27;s a big claim, but just hear me out because I do mean it literally. &gt;&gt; The singularity just started. That&#x27;s a pretty bold way to start a video. That what he means by singularity, by the way, Jesse, is that um we&#x27;ve reached a point where techn AI is now smarter than humans and is about to rapidly increase</p>
<p>in abilities past what we can understand and take over the world. The problem is he said that last week. Uh so if when this video airs we haven&#x27;t been taken over by super powerful AI bots yet. I guess he got that prediction wrong, but who knows? It could be embarrassing. It could be uh this is just playing out into a field full of human corpses as the robots laugh. But I doubt it. This type of reporting is common on YouTube. Um I&#x27;m going to bring up for this particular YouTuber. I don&#x27;t know who this is, but just bring up this particular YouTuber. I&#x27;m going to bring his video page up on the screen here. Um, I just want to read some of his uh</p>
<p>titles. Claudebot broke everything in 72 hours. The one before that, Claudebot is about to break everything. Okay, so it it it was about to break everything and then it did. He spelled everything wrong, though, which is interesting. &gt;&gt; Do you think he did that on purpose? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think so. I don&#x27;t think so. LTX2 unleashed AI video. Google&#x27;s mind-blowing world creator. Uh, Kimmy K2.5 agent swarm is insane. almost unimaginable power. Claude Rod is out of control. AI 2026 is going to be wild. Um, uh, blah blah blah blah. Deskaling</p>
<p>shock is coming and so on. Right? So, the point is is like everything is a huge deal. Everything that happens. Here&#x27;s another popular AI, uh, YouTube page. Let me read some of these headlines. AI singularity moment just hit. Multiple AI behavior freaks people out. AI explodes this month. Um, China&#x27;s new shape-shifting AI robot walks on water. Google&#x27;s new AI alpha genome just unlocked a code of human life. Um, Open AI just dropped prison prism. Things just got serious. China&#x27;s new AI Kimmy K2.5 shocks Deep Seek and Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Labs. Um, blah blah blah. So, that&#x27;s a lot of this going on on YouTube where everything is astonishing. Everything is the biggest deal. Everything just broke. AGI just got here. This is changing everything. People are really freaked out. The problem is if there&#x27;s two videos a week saying the same thing for three years. It gets pretty exhausting and it it sort of stretches out your nervous system and exhausted. So you feel like I don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s just like always major things happening. I can&#x27;t keep up. The world is is out of control or whatever. Now, of course, the</p>
<p>reality here is fostishment is popular on YouTube because you do better in the algorithm if you&#x27;re making a more strong pronouncement. That&#x27;s all it is. Like, you can&#x27;t blame the creators. These videos are just going to do better. It&#x27;s not someone People don&#x27;t just sit there and read your feed and watch your videos one by one. Your videos are being served up in an algorithmic stream and that does better. But you as the consumer of information about AI have to be wary that most of these YouTube videos on AI makes every single thing that happened the biggest deal ever. And you can go back their track record and be like, &quot;But that went away and that went away.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, just go back and read the the Sora 2 articles. It was like the end of movies and TV. It&#x27;s the end of creativity. It&#x27;s the end of all social media. Um, everything is going to be Sora 2. What really happened? It was kind of weird. it was expensive and no one talks about it anymore. So everything is astonishing but few things actually are. All right. So let me step back and uh give you a conclusion here. I talked about three traps that we see common commonly when you look at AI reporting. You got vibe reporting where you omit information and put</p>
<p>loosely related quotes together to give a vibe of you&#x27;re saying something without ever actually saying it. You get the digital ick mining where you just describe something usually at like the edges of the AI world that&#x27;s unsettling without trying to discuss technically what&#x27;s happening there and what implications that might have for the future because typically it&#x27;s not technically interesting. The implications are minuscule. You just want to give a sense of like AI is gross. And then you have astonishment where every single thing that happens is astonishing. I mean, one YouTube video in AI that I think uh should have an astonishing</p>
<p>headline is uh anything following the Jensen Wong&#x27;s jacket. Shock. In shock move, Wong wears Mad Max jacket to give speech. That requires astonishment. Um so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on. You got to be careful about it. And the reason why I&#x27;m giving names to these traps is it makes it easier to notice. And then here&#x27;s what you do. Here&#x27;s my simple advice. If you&#x27;re reading or watch something about AI, which is good, you should stay up to speed. If you notice one of those traps and now that you know how to name it, it&#x27;ll be way clear like, &quot;Ah, man, your vibe reported, this is X stuff,&quot; or</p>
<p>like, &quot;Oh, this is clearly forstonishment.&quot; Close the tab or switch to a different video. And if you don&#x27;t notice one of those traps, like, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m going to stick with this more.&quot; And it&#x27;s just going to change your relationship with AI. You&#x27;re going to be getting the real information. You&#x27;ll be informed, but you&#x27;re not going to be</p>
<h2>Rethinking Morning Routines</h2>
<p>constantly like simultaneously terrified and exhilarated and exhausted. and it&#x27;s just going to make this a much more sane news stream in your life. Now, the the key point here is there&#x27;s a lot of good AI reporting going on, right? I&#x27;m just there&#x27;s more of it that has these traps, so you have to be careful to avoid it, but there&#x27;s a lot going on there that I like. Uh, you know, my home, the New Yorker, does like a ton of deep reporting on AI and not just my stuff. There&#x27;s like a lot of great stuff there. I like Cade Mets over at the times. I think he&#x27;s got a great rolodex so he&#x27;s able to get quotes from like the right people to put things in the context. A lot of good coverage. So just look out</p>
<p>for those traps and skip the stuff that is uh showing off signs of those traps. All right. Now, I think this general project is important beyond just AI. This podcast is all about the fight for depth in an increasingly distracted world. And to understand what it is you&#x27;re fighting against means you have to be able to navigate technology coverage. So, we&#x27;ve seen these type of traps before. I used to get into it a lot with crypto bros. They were like the the blockchain is the future of all software. And I&#x27;m like, look, I&#x27;m literally a distributed systems expert. My doctorate is from the theory of</p>
<p>distributed systems group. I just taught a doctoral seminar on the mathematics behind blockchains. I&#x27;m telling you, this does not make sense as a way to build software and it&#x27;s not going to take off. And they were like, you are crazy. We&#x27;re like six weeks away from the internet running on Ethereum or whatever. All of that went none of that happened. I was right. But I got yelled at a lot then. And there&#x27;s a lot of those same traps going on. We&#x27;re going to see those traps. You know, it&#x27;s AI now. It&#x27;ll be something else in the future. So, it&#x27;s just good in general to to know what to look out for. Not all coverage of technology can be fully trusted. So, there we go, Jesse. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>what we have to worry about. &gt;&gt; I love your naming conventions with everything. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s always so good. &gt;&gt; Vibe digital ick faux astonishment. Yeah. All right. I like that. All right. Let&#x27;s take another quick break to hear from our sponsors. Listeners of this show know that in the world of business, I&#x27;m a fan of systems that can help organize the efforts of teams.

Um, let&#x27;s move on to some practices. All right, so the idea of a morning routine is not new. I actually looked into this. Probably the the earliest written</p>
<p>discussion of a morning routine goes back to the Jewish Talmid. If you look in track date, bro, broka, I&#x27;m saying the Hebrew wrong. the plural of Baraka. So sorry, sorry rabbis. Um the rabbis debate the worship obligations of the Jewish people and they make it clear that morning prayer morning prayers which are known as to feel shakit are an obligation right so if you read these morning prayers they&#x27;re pretty quite moving right you&#x27;re like when you wake up you&#x27;re acknowledging God you&#x27;re giving thanks for the fact that like you woke up it&#x27;s not a given you go to sleep it&#x27;s like a mini death uh that you lived another day</p>
<p>like it&#x27;s a great morning routine so we&#x27;ve been talking about morning routines since the very beginning of the common era um but the point is right they&#x27;re we&#x27;ve been talking about for a long time. In recent years, morning routines have come back into vogue and there&#x27;s a particular interest in them from young people. And I say this because there&#x27;s a lot of morning routine uh content on YouTube right now and the audience of YouTube heavily skews towards young people. This is what got me interested. Why is there a</p>
<p>resurgence even though this is an old idea of having a morning routine? Why is there a resurgence in interest in this concept right now among young people? So, I have an an explanation I want to offer that I haven&#x27;t heard discussed that often recently, but I think once we understand it, it&#x27;ll help all of us who are thinking about morning routines build better rituals. All right, so let&#x27;s just like start right away with what that factor is. All right, so Jesse, here&#x27;s what I think is going on. I think morning routines right now are particularly interesting to young people because of a need to escape technology.</p>
<p>And let me explain this, right? If you&#x27;re uh if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re a little bit older, you&#x27;re in your 40s, you have kids and like an office job, you don&#x27;t think as much about morning routines because you have one whether you want one or not, right? Like I have to get my kids to school. So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a very clear morning routine. wake up, make coffee, make sure they have breakfast, get everyone packed up and out the door. I walk them to the bus stop, walk home from the bus stop, and then I can move into work for the day. Like, that&#x27;s a very clear structured routine that I have no choice but to do or not because like I got to get those</p>
<p>kids out the door and it&#x27;s very structured what has to happen. But if you&#x27;re younger and you don&#x27;t have a family and maybe you have like a remote work job or something like this, your morning might be wide open. And so what&#x27;ll happen if you don&#x27;t have a routine for your morning? You&#x27;re going to pick up that phone and then that algorithmically curated content is going to capture your attention like this is really engaging. And then maybe when you&#x27;re trying to start work, you&#x27;re like, well, I&#x27;m going to let me go to email and Slack first because again, this is more engaging. I don&#x27;t I can kind of just like be passing</p>
<p>messages back and forth or looking for something interesting to happen. And also I&#x27;m on my phone at the same time and you can look up and it&#x27;s like a.m. Like I&#x27;ve really done nothing but look at my phone and sort of answer emails. I&#x27;m not doing anything really useful. I&#x27;ve got trapped by the engagement of technology. This then is why I think young people are more interested in morning routines because if you can structure your morning, it can prevent you from falling into technological quicksand and it can get you into doing actual useful stuff much more quickly and then you feel much</p>
<p>better about your day and your day is much more productive. So I think once we understand that which I think is a very good use for morning routines. Once we understand that being a primary goal of these routines, I think we can identify then uh some points that anyone can think about then about what makes an effective or non-effective morning routine. So I&#x27;m going to bring up a blackboard here to draw on. God help us when I draw. Um, for those who are listening and instead of just watching on this blackboard</p>
<p>right now, it says morning routine principles. All right. So, I want to go through four principles for a good morning routine that is inspired by this idea of our goal here is to get into productive work without getting lost in technology. All right. So, here&#x27;s the first principle. I&#x27;ll just do pictures on here, Jesse, because people think my drawing is fantastic and you got to give people what they want. All right. That&#x27;s clearly a clock, right? Yep. &gt;&gt; All right. So, here&#x27;s what I mean by that. There&#x27;s no need for an overly long routine, right? 10 to 20 minutes should be enough</p>
<p>max to help get your brain activated and focused and switch to like whatever productive thing you want to do in the morning. You don&#x27;t need a three-hour routine or a 4-hour routine or God help us, didn&#x27;t we look at like a six-hour routine when Brad was here a couple weeks ago? Um, once you&#x27;re past like 10 or 20 minutes can help you like reorient and get oriented for the day. going past that, there&#x27;s no uh continued aggregation of benefits. So, especially if you&#x27;re like losing sleep to get up super early or find yourself having to do like hours of effort, like that&#x27;s crazy for our goal</p>
<p>of helping you to avoid technology traps. So, 10 20 minutes, that should be enough. All right, principle number two. Let&#x27;s see here. That look like someone doing a yoga pose. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Down dog. &gt;&gt; Right. So, here&#x27;s like someone outside on a yoga mat, you know, doing a fantastically done um yoga pose. Here&#x27;s the principle I want to make here. You should find whatever whatever like flavor or twist or motivation makes a</p>
<p>morning routine compelling to you. Because if it&#x27;s not compelling, you&#x27;re not going to do it. And if you don&#x27;t do it, you don&#x27;t get the benefits. Now, this is something I think that people often misunderstand because they think about things that make sense to them and then think about the twists that are compelling to other people as somehow like, well, that&#x27;s just weird, right? Like, that&#x27;s no good. That must be um, you know, you&#x27;re wrong or it&#x27;s grifty or something like that, right? But the point is is like you got to find what makes it compelling. So, for some people, like I drew here, a spiritual hook is what&#x27;s compelling. It&#x27;s like, I want to greet the sun in the morning.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m greeting mother earth or like I want to through yoga and breathing I&#x27;m going to like connect to the ground in like the morning sun or something. And for like a lot of people that&#x27;s a really good hook. Other people they want to throw some like science at it, right? So they&#x27;re like no no no I want to go out and look at the sun because like Huberman told me it hits certain receptors in my visual cortex which creates a hormonal cascade which is going to help my circadian rhythm reset or something like that. Like maybe that&#x27;s exaggerated. Maybe that&#x27;s not like 100% true. But we&#x27;re not trying to get FDA approval for a drug here. We&#x27;re just trying to look for something to get you motivated. So some people like that</p>
<p>sort of sciency type stuff around it. Um if if that&#x27;s what if protocols is like what makes you, you know, do it, then that&#x27;s fine, too. Like whatever it is that that works for you, um that&#x27;s what you should use because the worst morning routine is the one that you actually don&#x27;t follow. All right. Um principle number three. I&#x27;m going to draw here. These are like numbers. I&#x27;m drawing like a time block plan here,</p>
<p>Jesse. Okay. So, why am I drawing a time block pan here? Well, my principle is you need a clear off-ramp from the morning routine into the productive activity that follows. So, you have to somehow connect. You&#x27;re doing this ritual to try to reorient your brain, get it ready to do stuff that it might not want to do,</p>
<h2>Did I see somewhere that you’re filming a MasterClass?</h2>
<p>but you then need to help get from there to the actual work, some sort of uh off-ramp into your day. And so it might be like at the end of your routine, you sit down and you draw out your time block plan for the day and then you start. Or it might be you go for a final walk where like you organize like what you&#x27;re going to write that morning if you&#x27;re a writer and then you you you come right down to your keyboard and just start writing or whatever it is. But have a well- definfined off-ramp that gets you from this into your day. Because if you do this whole ritual to orient your brain and get you ready for activity and then you just go into checking your phone, you&#x27;ve defeated the whole purpose, at least the</p>
<p>technological escape purpose. All right, the fourth principle here. Let&#x27;s see. I&#x27;m going to draw this. I have an idea here. So, this is this is like someone holding up a it&#x27;s like a trophy or a championship cup. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. like someone who&#x27;s like really excited about it. Uh don&#x27;t have unreasonable expectations for what your morning routine actually delivers. This is much more clear once we realize our goal here is not to get trapped in our technology and lose our morning. Get rid of other expectations. All right.</p>
<p>For example, your morning routine is not a major driver of your health. We get a lot of this of like you do 70 different things involving supplements and this and that and I have to go into uh into this cold plunge to stimulate exactly this type of response or whatever it is and you try to get the sense of like by doing all of these steps each morning I&#x27;m going to be very healthy or going to have longevity. Most of that&#x27;s just BS, right? Like there&#x27;s super minor benefits you might get uh along the way. Um but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re minimal. Stolberg had like a good I forget exactly what the quote</p>
<p>was, but he like went through the research on like cold plunges and it was like the positive a effect it gives you was so small it was like the equivalent of like eating a pastry you like like great yes you get some minor that you&#x27;re that&#x27;s not like the driver of all of your health, right? So don&#x27;t have expectations that these routines are going to um be a major driver of your health. Don&#x27;t have the expectations these routines are going to be a major driver of your success that if you do like these right 15 things in the morning you&#x27;re going to be super successful. It&#x27;s you&#x27;re not I mean it&#x27;s going to save you from getting trapped in your technology, but the work you do is still hard and becoming successful is</p>
<p>still hard and you still have to build skills and it&#x27;s rare and rare and valuable skills and it&#x27;s complicated and it&#x27;s stressful and it might not work out and the morning routine can&#x27;t make that easier for you and the morning routine can&#x27;t guarantee you. Um what they can help you do is wasting time with a messy start to your day. That&#x27;s what they do. So set your expectations reasonably that that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do and then you&#x27;re going to have much better experience. So, let&#x27;s look at these four principles all together. Let&#x27;s do a quick uh focus. Um, don&#x27;t make it too long. Here, I&#x27;ll even for people who are watching, I&#x27;ll even use my pointer. All right. I&#x27;ve been teaching with my my</p>
<p>iPad, so I&#x27;m used to this now. Don&#x27;t make it too long. 10 to 20 minutes is enough. Don&#x27;t be embarrassed about whatever hook gets you to actually do it, whether it&#x27;s pseudocience or pseudospirituality. Have a clear offramp into your day out of the morning routine. and don&#x27;t have unreasonable expectations about what your morning routine is going to deliver you. It is a way to avoid wasting your morning. I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s becoming popular among young people and I think that&#x27;s a good reason for anyone to try to think about their morning routine. And I think those four principles help you have something sane</p>
<p>and get those benefits without going off the deep end like that uh gentleman we saw a couple weeks ago with the six-hour routine. I&#x27;ll tell you what the biggest problem was about that clip, Jesse, with Ashton Hall. People thought it was me. And then I had to explain like, &quot;No, no, no, no, no, no. That wasn&#x27;t that wasn&#x27;t me. That was fitness influencer Ashton Hall.&quot; Um, I thought it was pretty obvious because I mean, my deltoids are much better defined than Ashton Hall. They should have picked that out. So, that was the only mistake. Like, Cal, your morning routine&#x27;s really long. Oh, it&#x27;s Ashton Hall. So, there we go. So, I</p>
<p>like I&#x27;m not anti-morning routines. You just got to know what you&#x27;re doing with it. And if you do, like they&#x27;re much it&#x27;s a much lower stakes thing. You can design useful ones. They help. They don&#x27;t change your life, but they make your mornings better. &gt;&gt; There we go. Morning routines. All right, let&#x27;s uh move on now to questions and comments. &gt;&gt; All right, what&#x27;s our first question, Jesse? &gt;&gt; First question is from Florian. Did I see somewhere that you&#x27;re filming a master class? This is true though. I was told by the masterclass team that the proper</p>
<p>terminology is I filmed a course for masterclass. The courses aren&#x27;t called master classes. The company&#x27;s called masterclass. You film courses for masterclass. I learned all sorts of things, Jesse. Uh I did. I filmed a course last fall for masterclass. It&#x27;s primarily drawing from my book slow productivity with a little deep work in there as well. So it&#x27;s all about how do you do meaningful work without burning out? um or being overly busy or exhausted. So like the kind of core stuff I like to talk about is like redefining work at our distracted age and it&#x27;s out. It came out last Thursday. So you can find it if you&#x27;re curious. Go</p>
<h2>Now that David Brooks left the NYT, will he start a Substack?</h2>
<p>to masterclass.com Newport. Um also I&#x27;m pretty sure the newsletter that came out today will also talk about it if you want to learn more about it. U it was fun. Here&#x27;s the here&#x27;s the main thing I noticed. I have a lot of thoughts there&#x27;s a lot of thoughts about the future of media. this sparked me, Jesse. And uh read the newsletter. I&#x27;m kind of getting into this more. But the thing that was cool about filming a master class is I didn&#x27;t realize to get that TV level production quality. It&#x27;s such a different level of investment in crew than like even a</p>
<p>really good podcast. Because I&#x27;ve been on all the major podcast, huge podcast, top 10 podcast, and they look fine, right? But typically, you&#x27;re going to have three thousand DSLR cameras and like two 26 year olds that like run them and do editing and that&#x27;s it, right? &gt;&gt; MasterClass, it was I counted it. The crew was over 20. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s incredible. &gt;&gt; Over 20 people. Um, real pros. Real pros, right? You know, like the director had done a lot of TV. I knew the person doing my makeup had worked on the makeup for the Ryan Cougler movie sinners. Like it was really cool. Um, so there&#x27;s a</p>
<p>there&#x27;s a gap between what&#x27;s required to get like full cinematic or TV quality video and like what&#x27;s happening in even high-end video podcasting right now. And so like a question that got I got thinking about after doing the master class is what&#x27;s going to happen when that gap closes. I think that&#x27;s a really interesting thing. So like MasterClass is an independent company, but they&#x27;re filming at that full sort of like streamer quality level. What&#x27;s going to happen when more and more independent creators are doing that as well? Where we no longer have this distinction between, well, the things I&#x27;m seeing on my TV from Netflix are very separatable</p>
<p>in my mind visually from like the things I&#x27;m seeing on YouTube. When that gap closes, I think some interesting things are going to happen in the world of media that might not be the best things if you&#x27;re Disney Plus or Netflix. Um, so anyways, I have some interesting thoughts about media that spurn. I&#x27;m</p>
<h2>Cal reacts to comments</h2>
<p>going to put some of those into the the newsletter. But for now, the thing to know is yes, it was great. I enjoyed doing it. I think it&#x27;s an awesome class. It looks great. Uh, we there was like a wardrobe person like there&#x27;s a green room. They rented a mansion. Wardrobe person who just like went and bought a bunch of clothes and had them on a big rack like let&#x27;s try this, let&#x27;s try that. Okay, I think that looks good. It&#x27;s like all movie stuff. got be like the single nerdiest person since uh what was the guy? I was like the single nerdiest person to be filmed by that many people since the uh well I can&#x27;t remember the guy&#x27;s name. He was from</p>
<p>Ferris Beller and then he had that game show. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; Ben Stein. What was his name? &gt;&gt; You know what I&#x27;m talking about? The Beller. Yeah, that guy was kind of a nerd. Yeah. Um it reminded me of that. They were like, &quot;Oh god, we were just working with Michael B. and and now we got Cal Newport. &gt;&gt; Have you seen on Netflix the option to watch podcasts now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that I mean this is why this is what&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting is the the standards visual standards for Netflix are reducing so as they bring on video pod some video podcast and the standards of independent media is getting higher. So these worlds are meeting and I think</p>
<p>interesting stuff&#x27;s going to happen. You know why they&#x27;re putting podcast on there? &gt;&gt; Daytime TV. They&#x27;re losing to YouTube for daytime watch hours. They&#x27;re winning in the evening watch hours because their content is good and when people sit down to watch the show, they want to watch like high-end stuff. But during the day, people don&#x27;t put on Netflix, they put on YouTube, and they want those daytime hours. Like, we could really increase our viewership if we could have people put on daytime. So, they&#x27;re just paying to bring over these daily podcasts that have like pretty good production values. If we have these</p>
<p>on Netflix, then people will watch them on us instead of YouTube. That&#x27;s it. &gt;&gt; So, like Bill Simmons, they brought over a bunch of his stuff. um bar stool sports, right? They brought over Yeah. Yeah. a bunch of those stuff. So, that&#x27;s interesting to see interesting trends. I think there&#x27;s a lot of interesting stuff. The future of media, visual media, which is the dominant media, sorry, Substack and newspapers, but it&#x27;s the dominant media um out there right now. Really interesting stuff I think is happening. as the gap between the high end and the independent goes away, we&#x27;re going to have an explosion of of</p>
<p>changes, which I think will will largely be largely be good. All right. Uh, what</p>
<h2>Cal gives his weekly reading update</h2>
<p>else do we have? &gt;&gt; Next is from Will. I just saw the news that David Brooks is leaving the New York Times. Do you think he will follow a similar path to Krumigan and write for Substack? &gt;&gt; Uh, it is true David Brooks is leaving. I guess he left already. He&#x27;s left the Times, not unlike Paul Krugman doing it. Um, no, he&#x27;s not going to write a substack. So, these are two different situations. When Paul Krugman left the Times, he went completely independent. So, all he&#x27;s doing now is writing his substack and actually making a killing at it, but he&#x27;s only writing his Substack. David Brooks is not leaving the world of elite institutions to go independent. He&#x27;s just going from one</p>
<p>elite institution to uh a pair of elite institutions. So, what he did is he took a position at Yale. And so now he has a Yale position as a a scholar and residence or fellow or something like this where I think he&#x27;s even going to do some teaching and then took a a journalism position at the Atlantic. And so I think what&#x27;s happening here, if I had to guess, I don&#x27;t know these details, but if I had to guess, there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a pretty strong rhythm if you&#x27;re a full-time op-ed writer for the New York Times. You have to produce whatever it is like once a week or something like this. Like you&#x27;re constantly writing columns. Now I think that he he already writes for the</p>
<p>Atlantic. These longer form things are less often. I think he&#x27;ll continue to do that. That&#x27;s a place for him to do his like long form less often articles. He&#x27;s also doing a podcast for the Atlantic. So, they&#x27;re going to produce it a video podcast. So, he&#x27;s going to be that&#x27;s going to I think he&#x27;s looking at like what Ezra Klein is doing. Actually, the Times has like Ross Du Hut and David French and more and more people are doing daily video podcasts. So, he&#x27;s switching more to that probably less writing and then he&#x27;s also teaching and and has his position at Yale. So, no, he&#x27;s not going Substack. He&#x27;s very much still entrenched in elite institutions. But, you know, it&#x27;s interesting</p>
<p>interesting to see. You know, things definitely are uh shaking up. All right. I think we also have Let me see what I can find on here. I think we also have a few comments from last week&#x27;s episode. Last week, we talked about phones, right? We we did uh accounts, real accounts of people who spend extended amount of time without their phones and what benefits they reported and gave some advice about how to get those benefits without having to give up your smartphone. We have two YouTube comments to share here. The first comes from Summerrf Catz who said phone free life is for people who have friends. Well,</p>
<p>it&#x27;s funny, but it&#x27;s also it is kind of true, right? That there one of the reasons why people are on their phone all the time is that it can give you a simulacum of sociality. If if you&#x27;re lonely, it&#x27;s it feels incredibly bad, but it&#x27;s hard to make and maintain friends. You have to sacrifice non-trivial time and attention on behalf of other people. these networks online, these apps online can kind of press the friendship sociality buttons just enough that you don&#x27;t feel like devastatedly lonely, but you&#x27;re also not really getting nourished. There&#x27;s a time a word for this in the social psych literature.</p>
<p>They call it social snacking. You&#x27;re getting just enough sort of simulation of sociality that you don&#x27;t feel lonely, but not enough to actually be nourished. And so, yes, that is part of the problem. If you spend less time on your phone, you have to spend more time in the real world engaging with friends. My book, Digital Minimalism, gets into a lot of those details. So, I would recommend that. Oh, here&#x27;s another comment. This came from Clear Heart2658. Why does everyone who ditch these smartphones have an overwhelming need to live in the woods? Can&#x27;t you do that in a city? Well, that is a good point. Bejorn Bullhansen was definitely definitely living in the woods. That guy</p>
<p>is awesome. Um, I think if you put Bejorn Bull Hansen into a a city, I don&#x27;t know what would happen. I think he would be run over by a cab within I I think he would wander into a street if he was in Manhattan and then one of those like petty cabs they have now where they&#x27;re blaring the really loud music. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve been to Manhattan recently, but this is the new thing. These bike powered cabs that just blare really loud music. One of those would come by um he would tip it. I think he would just pick it up and tip it over um and then jump onto a police horse and ride off in the Central Park. I think</p>
<p>that&#x27;s what would happen if Bejorn Bullhans went to the city. No, you could do these phone free lifestyles or limited phone lifestyles. do them anywhere. I think Warner Herzog is often in cities, right? Uh yeah, why not? I mean, I guess you maybe have more reasons you need to use the phone. You&#x27;re more social. I don&#x27;t know. But no, you&#x27;re right. You don&#x27;t have to go to the woods. And sometimes all of these examples having soft music with people sitting in the woods can kind of turn people off because they live in the suburbs and they don&#x27;t plan to move to the woods and they still are upset with their phone. So, I think that is uh I think that is a good point. All right. Uh final segment like to talk about what</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been reading recently. Couple things to talk about. I read a book last weekend. Uh it was an advanced copy, so that&#x27;s not out yet. It&#x27;s coming out sometime this spring, but it was a topic I was interested in. So, you know, the author sent it to me and I read it. It was called Time Freedom by Brian Harriet. Um he&#x27;s a financial adviser and he&#x27;s sort of working through the numbers of financially supporting something like lifestyle design without having to either save up a huge amount of money that you can just live off of or go incredibly frugal. What&#x27;s what&#x27;s the other option? He talks</p>
<p>about flexible income. So you have like relatively flexible entrepreneurial income and you can fill in some gaps as needed by drawing safely from your savings and you can actually have a much more flexible lifestyle. You&#x27;re working but working on your own terms. Uh you can have a much more flexible lifestyle that&#x27;s mixed work with other stuff much earlier than waiting till retirement without having to be super frugal. He&#x27;s an example. He&#x27;s financial adviser. He&#x27;s got a lot of flexibility and he&#x27;s arranged things so they can spend every summer by at a lakehouse not working. He&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not he&#x27;s not retired, but</p>
<p>that&#x27;s also a very flexible life. He has time freedom. So, I thought that was an interesting book. There&#x27;s some ideas that reminded me of the Deep Life book I&#x27;m working on now. I also like Charles Doohig&#x27;s New Yorker piece on organizations. He was talking about the difference uh behind how the MAGA right and the Democratic left, they organize themselves differently and one has been more effective than the other. And then he sort of draws from sort of theory of how to organize and motivate change. It reminded me of some like classic cladwell stuff. It was interesting article. It&#x27;s called One Direction. Um I thought it was interesting. We might</p>
<p>have even had it loaded up, but like I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t need to find that. That&#x27;s okay. Uh then another book to mention. I haven&#x27;t read this yet. I just got a note about this from my cousin. So Jesse, my cousin Josh Douglas published this is the type of book I like. I like super high concept genre. I think can be a lot of fun, especially if you&#x27;ve been reading like more if I&#x27;m reading more like sober non-fiction, whatever. Sometimes it&#x27;s fun to throw in more high concept genres. So, he has a book out. I love this title, The Vampire, The Tutor, and the Mad Man. And here&#x27;s the description. It&#x27;s an</p>
<p>action-driven novel full of monsters, mysteries, and pure evil hiding in an ancient castle deep in the remote mountains of southern China. Jonathan, a wayfairing English teacher running from his past through travel and alcohol. Uh, he takes a job from a serious employer who is nauseatingly wealthy and full of secrets up against wolves, bandits, mutant monsters, mad scientists, and his own demons. Jonathan risked all to save a gorgeous mute scholar made and get away wildly wealthy. That sounds fun to me. That&#x27;s the type of thing that&#x27;s like a thriller December reading. So anyways, that&#x27;s Josh Douglas. You can find that online. Uh, that was cool. Like high</p>
<p>concept. Too many novels today. All the book club novels are all the same. It&#x27;s all like this sort of that&#x27;s really good. You know, there should be more mutant monsters or whatever. I think it&#x27;s fun. All right. Uh that&#x27;s all the time we have for today. Thanks for listening. We&#x27;ll be back next week with another episode. And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, so if you like this discussion about traps and AI reporting, you might like episode 386, which will give you an example of good AI reporting when I was joined with AI commentator Ed Zitron to review the year 2025 and all the AI news that happened.</p>
<p>Check it out. I think you&#x27;ll like it. So Ed is going to join me and what we&#x27;ve done is we&#x27;ve pulled the biggest AI stories of 2025, one per month for the entire year. We&#x27;re going to go through them in order and Ed is going to help us make sense of what was going on behind the scenes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All right. So, this is where we like to get super practical. Here&#x27;s what I want to do today is I&#x27;m going to take a very piece of practical internet advice and we&#x27;re going to dissect it. Let me load this on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening. It&#x27;s from the YouTuber Dan Co. It&#x27;s an article he posted as an essay on Twitter called How to Fix Your Entire Life in One Day. And let me zoom in on that. 173 million reads so far. That&#x27;s pretty crazy, Jesse. That&#x27;s like almost as many copies as I&#x27;ve sold of How to Become a High School Superstar. I was just gonna</p>
<p>say &gt;&gt; not quite not quite how to become a high school superstar level. But man, that guy is getting close. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s getting close to that level. Um I didn&#x27;t even know you could post essays on Twitter. I guess that&#x27;s a thing. Uh I&#x27;ll tell you who&#x27;s going to be doing it now. Everybody. Because this one article got 173 million views. Anyways, how to fix your entire life in one day. Viral internet advice. Why are we going to look at that in the practices segment? Well, it&#x27;s practical advice and we&#x27;re going to break it apart and we&#x27;re going to go through the the seven suggestions he has. But I&#x27;m thinking about this exercise in the light of last week&#x27;s</p>
<p>episode where we had Brad Stolberg on and he was talking about his new book, The Way of Excellence. And we were talking about in general what is the impact of in the internet on our natural instinct for ambition and we said look it could be one of two things. Sometimes it actually can help guide us and help us fulfill our ambitions. And sometimes it can hijack our ambitions, but sort of like nonsense content that in the moment feels really good, but is actually distracting us from things that really matter. This seems like a great case study to apply this type of thinking. Is Dan Co super viral article</p>
<p>is something that&#x27;s hijacking our ambition or supporting it? So, we&#x27;re going to go through it real quick and uh I&#x27;ll get Jesse&#x27;s opinion. I&#x27;ll tell you my opinion. I actually talked to Brad about this last night, so I&#x27;ll tell you what he said. So, we&#x27;re going to kind of have a little court of inquiry at the end. All right. So, we&#x27;re going to go through this really quickly. Um I&#x27;m going to start by reading from his intro his words just to set up how he describes this and then we&#x27;ll go through a seven piece of advice. So, here&#x27;s what Dan says. If you&#x27;re anything like me, you think New Year&#x27;s resolutions are stupid. Because most people go about changing</p>
<p>their lives in a completely wrong way. They create these resolutions because everyone else does. We create a superficial meaning out of status games. But they don&#x27;t meet the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than convincing yourself you&#x27;re going to be a more dis more disciplined or more productive this year. I&#x27;m eliding a little bit. However, as much as I think New Year&#x27;s resolutions are stupid, it&#x27;s always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself towards something that that&#x27;s much better as we will discuss. So whether you want to start the business or transform your body or take the risk toward a more</p>
<p>meaningful life without quitting after 2 weeks, I want to share seven ideas you probably haven&#x27;t heard before on behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in 2026. All right, so that&#x27;s a pretty lofty goal, Jesse. Um, he has seven pieces of advice. Let&#x27;s go through these one by one. I&#x27;ll give you a quick summary. All right. So, here&#x27;s piece of advice one. I&#x27;ll show it briefly on the screen. Uh, you you aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you aren&#x27;t a person who would be there. Does that kind of make sense? That&#x27;s a little bit We&#x27;re going to have to untangle a little bit of things here.</p>
<p>Um, I read that more carefully. Here&#x27;s how I summarized it in my own notes here. Lifestyle trumps discipline. Instead of setting a surface level goal and hyping yourself to remain disciplined for a few weeks, consider creating a lifestyle that makes the outcome you desire uh much easier if or even unavoidable, right? So, I think that&#x27;s what when I when I read this closely, I think that&#x27;s what he says is lifestyle is better than discipline. All right? He doesn&#x27;t tell you to do that yet. That&#x27;s what the rest of the advice is about. All right. Here&#x27;s idea two. Pull this up here. The way he his title here is you aren&#x27;t where you want to be</p>
<p>because you don&#x27;t want to be there. You can&#x27;t do this with the English language, Jesse. There&#x27;s a lot of negatives and negative negatives and okay, it&#x27;s a little circular, but I read this carefully. Here&#x27;s my summary of idea two. Your behaviors follow your desires. Our behavior isn&#x27;t goal oriented. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m using his words here. It&#x27;s teological, meaning we do things because we want certain outcomes. For example, we procrastinate not because we lack discipline, but because we want to quote protect ourselves from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing our</p>
<p>work and quote, you stay in the dead-end job because you want the security and predictability, etc., etc. So what he&#x27;s saying there Jesse is that um we are doing things because for certain outcomes we tell ourselves we do things to accomplish certain goals but actually our behaviors are often not just us being undisiplined or not having a goal. there&#x27;s a the behaviors we don&#x27;t like often do have a goal that&#x27;s desirable to us. That for like a lot of people, it&#x27;s desirable not to work on these bigger projects because uh we don&#x27;t want to be</p>
<p>in a a position to actually be assessed and be rejected or we actually like the security of this bad job. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not interested. So, he&#x27;s saying um behaviors follow desires. You have to think about what you actually desire in your life is more important than like what goals do you have. You should have let me help write this. I feel like I&#x27;m a clue. &gt;&gt; The whole time I was thinking, is this the stuff you were teaching those Dartmouth kids when you did that summer program? &gt;&gt; I taught those kids how to write. All right. Number three. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s words. You aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you&#x27;re afraid to be there. You aren&#x27;t</p>
<p>where you want to be because you&#x27;re afraid to be there. Okay. Uh here&#x27;s how I summarized that in my own notes. We protect the status quo for the sake of psychological consistency. Uh, so here&#x27;s this is literally in my notes, Jesse. I don&#x27;t fully understand this one. I tried to understand this one. It got a little bit complicated, but my best read is you build an identity as you grow up and then you will go through a lot to protect it for the sake of psychological consistency, even if that identity is harmful. So, you sort of build up an understanding of yourself, which not necessarily a</p>
<p>positive one. Um, but we want to whatever our self-standing is, we want to protect it. And we might protect it by sabotaging goals that on paper might be like, hey, that&#x27;s really good and ambitious and something you should do, but it might challenge this identity we have about ourselves. Like, I&#x27;m no good at that. I&#x27;m not smart. I people don&#x27;t respect me. And you don&#x27;t want to lose that identity. So, you you don&#x27;t pursue goals. So, there&#x27;s like a psychology there that&#x27;s important. All right. Idea four, uh, co summarizes it this way. The life you want lies within a specific level of</p>
<p>mind. All right. So again, here&#x27;s my notes here, Jesse. I wrote, I got fully lost in this one. Um, I&#x27;m going to read to you verbatim from a a a paragraph just so you get a sense of what I was dealing with here trying to summarize this one. This is me quoting, &quot;I&#x27;ve talked about these many times and synthesized them into my own human 3.0 no model and various AI prompts to uncover your level of development and a path forward. PN open a tab to read after if you like in PNS, but here&#x27;s the 8020 of the nine stages of ego development as a refresher because</p>
<p>repetition helps reveal things you didn&#x27;t notice before and there are new people reading these letters. He then presents this table which will make it all clear to you, Jesse. I This is a real thing. My god. Um, if you&#x27;re listening instead of just watching, I have never seen a more complicated. Is this a chart? It&#x27;s colors. It&#x27;s words. It&#x27;s quadrants. It looks like a little bit like you threw up Froot Loops, I guess, onto um like the printer test page. I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t</p>
<p>pull this apart. Uh, I&#x27;ll just read various words on here. states of consciousness, lines of development, types, interactive vision logic, integrative vision logic, uh personalistic relativistic, individualistic pluralistic, four out of five, radical relativism rules, single system view. I don&#x27;t know. I I don&#x27;t know if this is something that uh that Dan put together or something that someone else did that he&#x27;s referencing. I didn&#x27;t really understand this one. So, let&#x27;s move on. All right. Idea five. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s summary. Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of</p>
<p>life. All right, that&#x27;s very clear. I appreciate that. Um, he goes on to talk about cybernetics. Cybernetics is, you know, this is Norbert Weiner in the 1940s and 1950s talking about the merging of electronic mechanical machines and humans. So, you kind of like have feedback loops between like humans and machines and allows you to do something that a human by itself couldn&#x27;t do or a machine by itself couldn&#x27;t do. He was inspired by working on uh during the war like things for helping to aim anti-aircraft guns at fighter jets or not fighter jets, bombers and stuff like that. Uh so he references cybernetics to illustrate a model of goal pursuit where you keep</p>
<p>making adjustments to your path along the way to keep coming back towards the right way forward. This is the photo. This is a useful photo. This is like a classic cybernetic thing. You constantly make adjustments. So you you kind of leave the right course but then you adjust and then that you go off the other way, you adjust again. If you keep making adjustments, you make progress where towards you&#x27;re trying to get. Um, here&#x27;s his summary of the steps for a cybernetic approach to trying to get somewhere you want to get. Have a goal, act towards that goal, sense where you are, compare it to that goal, and act again based on that feedback. So, he&#x27;s</p>
<p>saying, and I think this is very pragmatic, you need to constantly like assess where you are and adjust. That&#x27;s how you make progress towards something. You&#x27;re not just going to have the perfect plan and just follow it and then two years later you&#x27;re there. You have to constantly be like, where am I? I&#x27;ve made some progress, but I veered off the goal. So, what adjustments do I make for going forward? Keep doing that and you&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll be moving in the general the general right direction. All right, idea piece of six. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s summary. How to launch into a completely new life in one day. So now he&#x27;s going to pull together a lot of these ideas. Um I went through this and I summarized there&#x27;s three parts. Now he&#x27;s trying to</p>
<p>summarize how do you put all these things into action your life and there&#x27;s three parts. One for what you do in the morning, one for what you do throughout the day and what one for what you do at the end of the day for trying to put all these ideas into practice. So, what he recommends briefly is during the morning you do a vision and anti-vision exercise where you spend 15 to 20 minutes reflecting on both what you like and don&#x27;t like about the path that you&#x27;re on. Like what do I want out of my life? What do I want my life to be? What would my life be like if I don&#x27;t do those things? This is like classic psychological uh possible future comparison. It&#x27;s very powerful actually.</p>
<p>All right. So, you you you spend 15 20 minutes. He gives you some questions to answer. Then part two during the day he says you should interrupt autopilot to regularly ask yourself questions like what am I avoiding right now by doing what I&#x27;m doing and he says actually he has a list of these questions put them into calendar events so that they can pop up with notifications and just remind you like stop whatever you&#x27;re doing and ask this question so he wants to break the idea of autopilot and keep you much more conscious about how you&#x27;re spending your time. Part three at the end of the day in the evening he wants you to synthesize any insight. So,</p>
<p>integrate any insights you had during the day into your understanding of your identity. There&#x27;s some time here for self-reflection. For example, he says, &quot;Write a single sentence that captures what you&#x27;re building towards knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.&quot; Um, then he goes on and says, &quot;You should have multi-scale goals, which of course I&#x27;m a fan of. You have daily goal, monthly goal, and one-year scale goals that you can be keeping track of.&quot; Finally, idea seven, pull it up here. This is Look how long how much I have to scroll. So, it&#x27;s a long article. All right. Idea seven, turn your life into a video game. So here he&#x27;s saying you can</p>
<p>gify some of this advice. Um I&#x27;m going to quote from him directly here. Your because I didn&#x27;t quite understand this, but maybe this will make sense to you, Jesse. Your vision is how you win, at least until the game evolves. Your anti- vision is what&#x27;s at stake. What happens if you lose or give up? Your one-year goal is the mission. This is your sole priority in life. Your one-mon project is the boss fight, how you gain XP and acquire loot. Your daily levers are the quest, the daily process that unlocks new opportunities. Your constraints are the rules, the limitations that encourage creativity. Okay, I get this.</p>
<p>Like you have um constraints in your life about things you do or don&#x27;t do. Each day you have certain things you do to like make that day better. On the factor of the month, you&#x27;re moving towards these one-mon goals which move you closer to your one-year mission. And you have a vision and anti- vision to help you know this is what I want and this is what I want to avoid. And he&#x27;s talking about you can kind of think of it like a video game. All right. So, there you go. I want to start by asking the question, why did this get so popular? Why did this rack up 173 million views and counting? Here&#x27;s my assessment. And Jess, you can tell me if this makes sense to you. In</p>
<p>self-help literature, there&#x27;s two different camps, two different types of self-help literature. The practical and the psychological, right? Um, so the the practical it&#x27;s it&#x27;s usually about like here is like really specific advice for achieving specific goals. Like in the world of books you might think about like James Clear&#x27;s atomic habits. It&#x27;s like really specific advice for how you make progress on habits or maybe online you would think of like classic Ali Abdal. You know he&#x27;ll really talk about specific setups or configurations of your technology to make progress on certain goals. The other genre is</p>
<p>psychological which is much more about the psychology behind your motivations and your actions. So, it&#x27;s about change your brain and you&#x27;re not going to get in the way of things that you want to do. So, in the book world, you might think about like Mark Manson&#x27;s book, uh, The Subtle Art, or Mel Robbins&#x27;s new book, The Let Them theory. These are psychological self-help books. Bnee Brown, I think, would fall in here as well. Less about step by step and more about changing your mind so the psychology doesn&#x27;t get in the way of action. So, these are both two genres that both have major bestsellers. I mean, right now, if you look at the</p>
<p>bestseller list, James Clear and Mel Robbins are right there. All right. I think what this essay did is it combined practical and psychological self-help. He has like practical ideas. You want to do this, put these events on your calendar, gify it this way, have goals at these levels. But he also talked a lot about the psychology, the psychology that&#x27;s getting in your way, that&#x27;s preventing you from making progress. Why? What&#x27;s going on in your brain? He talked about both and he put them together and then he layered on top of that</p>
<p>references and terminology that&#x27;s relevant to Ginz. I think that was a pretty powerful mix. Now, as you could tell by me going through it, I mean, look, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in my, you know, 40s. I&#x27;ve been a professional writer my whole life. I write for the New Yorker. I&#x27;m a writing snob. The writing is a little hard to follow sometimes, okay? Like, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s there&#x27;s ideas in there that haven&#x27;t fully been fleshed out. Some of them I really are and some of them I you can&#x27;t do that to the English language. This is referencing this this and this. But you put that aside and this is Dan Co&#x27;s project. Let&#x27;s talk</p>
<p>about psychology and practical. Put them together and in lingo that makes sense to a generation on Tik Tok and Instagram and YouTube idioms of speech and that type of movement, right? That kind of like you keep moving and say lots of things. Not not like our generation of carefully crafted writing. When I look at it that way, I say this does not hijack ambition. I think especially for a younger person, this would be useful. You start thinking about your mindset. You start thinking about practical advice. I mean, I think the system in here is pretty complicated. I think that rainbow the Froot Loops vomit chart is going to not</p>
<p>help be that helpful. I don&#x27;t know what the hell&#x27;s going on there. But in general, like, oh, I need to think about uh my psychology. That&#x27;s important. The practical advice seems pretty reasonable to me. vision and anti-vision planning. It&#x27;s is actually incredibly effective. Make really clear what&#x27;ll happen if you don&#x27;t change and make really clear where you could get if you do. That&#x27;s very powerful in motivating change. This idea that you need to change your understanding of yourself before you can make progress on certain goals. I think that&#x27;s interesting. The idea that people who do really important things often they&#x27;ve set up</p>
<p>their lives in such a way that like making progress is something that of course they do. It&#x27;s not a fight. It&#x27;s not a willpower discipline fight. is you got to change your life, not just change your goals. I think that&#x27;s important. Tracking things, having goals at multiple levels, I think that&#x27;s useful as well. So, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m going to if we have to choose hijack support, I think this leans for the support side. It&#x27;s not my cup of tea, but it wasn&#x27;t written for me. And uh hopefully I don&#x27;t know. I I think that could be pretty useful advice. What What&#x27;s your take, Jesse? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still flabbergasted about the 175 million views. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s a lot of people. I mean I</p>
<p>maybe they get they get seen a lot of times. I don&#x27;t really know how that works. &gt;&gt; And I kept I keep on thinking about this with your episode earlier a couple weeks ago about Substack too. &gt;&gt; Um yeah and the fact that he &gt;&gt; and then you mentioned the essay thing &gt;&gt; and he did this on Twitter which is interesting as opposed to like on Substack or something like that. &gt;&gt; I wonder if he has a Substack. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know man. This generation is not big on Substacks. There&#x27;s 8,000 replies. I I was reading through some of them and they were just like people like Yeah. It&#x27;s interesting. You know, sometimes you just catch the virality um genieing the bottle. Partially what&#x27;s happening</p>
<p>with this essay is what we&#x27;re doing here at large. Everybody is doing segments on the essay itself. So, it&#x27;s getting like huge like after aftermarket. &gt;&gt; Yeah. To put in perspective, like the Super Bowl in a couple weeks will probably get 110 million. &gt;&gt; But that&#x27;s people watching for four hours. Yeah. As opposed to a Twitter view. So, I don&#x27;t know how to translate that to real people. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Maybe it is though because international, right? Like this is all around the world. People could look at it. Anyways, I think it&#x27;s amazing how many people seen it. And I&#x27;m not upset that this thing is viral. Again, not my</p>
<p>completely my cup of tea, but there&#x27;s good ideas in there. And the reason why it&#x27;s successful is not because of some weirdness or griiness. I think that&#x27;s an interesting merging of psychological practical and jinz into a a certain um potent stew. It&#x27;s a good time to announce my new book aimed at Jinzy where I will also call it how to make What did my What did my son say today? I completely misunderstood it. He said like, &quot;Oh, my my Magic the Gathering deck is now busted.&quot; And I I was like, &quot;Um, oh, sorry. So,</p>
<p>you&#x27;re going to have to like get better cards or whatever.&quot; He&#x27;s like, &quot;No, that means good.&quot; So, I don&#x27;t know. So, I&#x27;m going to call it how to make your life busted. Escape mid and get to B from basic to busted and fix your entire life in 17 minutes. See what I&#x27;m doing there? More extreme. And I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know any other references. So, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s going to be. Lessons from Mr. Beast. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know. All right. So, there we go.</p>
<p>Uh, that&#x27;s our practices segment. Hey, if you like this video, I think you&#x27;ll really like this one as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There remains a gap between the production values of professional streaming services like Netflix and independent content that appears on platforms like YouTube. But what happens when that gap disappears? In the ideas segment of today’s episode, Cal sends a correspondent to investigate a fascinating new “micro-streaming” service producing Netflix-quality shows with a small team. Then, in the practices segment, he explains why he spent $60 on a single productivity application.

<h2>Are “Micro-Streamers” the Future of Media?</h2>
<p>Hey, so I recently filmed a course for MasterClass. Now, this was a really interesting experience and I think the final product was great and you can check it out at uh masterclass.com/cal newport. But the thing I want to focus on here is the production values because MasterClass really makes these things look good. They have uh big cameras with fancy lenses. There&#x27;s a director of photography. They have dedicated crew to do nothing but set up and adjust lights. And you can really tell like I&#x27;m going</p>
<p>to load up a scene here on the screen for people who are watching instead of just listening. Just so you can get a sense of what this looks like when they&#x27;re using the the full production crew. All right. Now, this stuff when we see it, we have to admit, is a level better than most of the video that&#x27;s being produced by independent creators like us here at this podcast. And here&#x27;s the thing I want to argue today. That gap has been making a really big difference in the media landscape. We have become trained as consumers that when we see video content at the level of quality of</p>
<p>something like MasterClass or Netflix, we say, &quot;Okay, that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll pay for.&quot; But if you move down just a little bit to the level below, like uh these really good video podcasts where people have nice DSLR cameras and some diffused light and it looks pretty good, people say, &quot;No, no, no. That is for free platforms like YouTube.&quot; So this difference of production value has really uh kept the moat around video that people will pay for. But here&#x27;s what I think is interesting about our current moment. There&#x27;s a small but growing movement of independent producers that are starting to create content at the same quality level as</p>
<p>those big players. I call these micro streamers. and I think they&#x27;re going to change the entire future of online media and entertainment as we know it. So, this is what we&#x27;re going to get into during the idea segment. Um, I dispatched my intrepid newsletter director and podcast re researcher Nate to actually go and subscribe and use one of the most popular and interesting of these new micro streamers. So, we&#x27;re going to go through his trip report about everything that he found and try to understand what&#x27;s going on and what this tells us about the future of media.</p>
<p>Um, a lot of what we discovered actually surprised me. So, I think you&#x27;re going to find this interesting as well. Then, in the practices segment, we&#x27;re going to switch gears and turn our attention to the world of digital productivity. I just spent $60. That&#x27;s right, $60 US on a task app. And I&#x27;m going to tell you what it is, and I&#x27;m going to explain to you why I spent so much money on it. because I think it highlights a more general principle about the intersection of technology and trying to organize your life. All right, so we have a lot to do. As always, I&#x27;m Cal Newport and</p>
<p>this is Deep Questions, the show about the fight for depth in an increasingly distracted world. We&#x27;ll get started right after the music. All right. So, to make this discussion more concrete, I want to take a closer look at a specific very successful micro streamer um that&#x27;s popular at the current moment. It has a couple names. It used to be called Dropout TV. They</p>
<p>now stylize it, if you see it online, as a colon followed by the word dropout. Uh it costs $6.99 a month. You can watch it on your devices or on an app on your TV just like you would Netflix or any other streaming service. Now, here&#x27;s the backstory of Dropout TV as best as I can tell. It actually came out of an early 2000&#x27;s era website called collegehumor.com. Do you remember College Humor, Jesse? That was like our college years. &gt;&gt; No, I don&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; Well, as someone who wrote for a College Humor magazine, I knew all about uh College Horror. I remember because I</p>
<p>really got started like right around uh I think 1999. So, right after 911, they actually had some pretty funny stuff. And the one I remember was like a a collection of books that the premise was they had come out right before 911 and now these books weren&#x27;t doing so well, like unfortunately time books. I remember one of them was like how to dress like the Taliban. It was just like some guy with a turban and like another one was like why airport security doesn&#x27;t matter. And so the premise was like these were all books that were now doing really poorly because they were very illtimed. So it was like a website. Then YouTube came along. This was after</p>
<p>I stopped uh following that site and it sounds like what they did is they went hard into video on YouTube and they were doing pretty well there. Nate did some research on this. I think they were up to like a million subscribers but they were frustrated because of two things. One, they were in the service of the algorithm, right? So, you know, whether or not their videos were promoted or not depended on this amorphous algorithm. And two, it was hard to find advertisers, especially when you&#x27;re doing humor or edgy humor. It can be hard to find advertisers. That was frustrating. So, at some point in the 2010s,</p>
<p>they created their own streaming platform. The company bounced back and forth between a couple owners and then eventually that became the full-time focus of the organization, a comedy, video streaming platform. Um, and that&#x27;s where they are now. Now, what are they known for? They&#x27;re known for uh very high production values. We&#x27;ll look at this in a second. The same as like a streamer&#x27;s unscripted TV quality. They have a rotating troop of really talented improv performers and then sort of special guests like sort of well-known comedians you would probably recognize</p>
<p>come on the shows as well. They are really good to their performers. They have almost like a co-op model where they want to pay performers like what they&#x27;re worth. Now, I did some research on this. One comedian uh talked about making more money filming a single episode of one of the shows on Dropout than he did for his seasonlong role on a Paramount TV Plus show. Uh some other specific numbers, they have a a show called Very Important People where they they put you in elaborate makeup and if you&#x27;re the</p>
<p>guest, you can make up to $10,000 per episode. They have another show called Dimension 20, which I think is a a Dungeons and Dragons. That&#x27;s like celebrity and comedians playing Dungeons and Dragons. $7,000 per episode. They even pay performers to audition because they recognize, hey, it&#x27;s a pain to come out and spend your time auditioning. So, uh it&#x27;s wellliked within the comedy uh community. It&#x27;s also doing really well among viewers. I&#x27;ve been trying to track these numbers from interview discussions. In 2023, Sam Reich, the CEO, talked about them</p>
<p>having quote mid hundreds of thousands of subscribers. U end quote. They then went on a big run that year. By 2025, they were reporting over a million subscribers. So, yes, this is much smaller than a Netflix, but a million subscribers at $7 uh a month, right? That&#x27;s whatever that is uh over $80 million a year. That&#x27;s a pretty big revenue generator. All right, so let&#x27;s take a closer look at what&#x27;s going on with this particular micro streamer and then I&#x27;m going to step back and try to figure out in general what what do you</p>
<p>need to succeed in this trend and what does it mean for the future of media. So as I mentioned before um we set our sent our intrepid newsletter director on to dropout TV to subscribe and spend some time on it and take some pictures and send us back uh some notes. So I&#x27;m gonna load up here on the screen for people who are watching. So just listing some of these screenshots. All right. So, this is the main interface of the channel. It&#x27;s featuring on the front here their on the top banner, the hero banner, one of their shows called Dimension 20 Adventuring Academy. These are improv comedians. They play Dungeons and Dragons and they banter with each other. Um, as you can see, Jesse, this</p>
<p>looks like Netflix, but also those production values, right? That&#x27;s the same you would see on any sort of unscripted show on TV. &gt;&gt; All right. Here&#x27;s another picture. This is the interface very similar to Netflix. Uh, Netflix. It&#x27;s a horizontal carousel and you could just see their shows and you can scroll sideways uh through the shows and we see here uh WTF 101 is a cartoon. There&#x27;s a show called Total Forgiveness. Cartoon Hell um Ultimate Ultimate I on Chat Ron Team Go. Um a lot of this is unscripted. Some of this is scripted itself. Here&#x27;s</p>
<p>some more shows here. Here we see Hank Green pissing out cancer. Um I think that maybe I think that&#x27;s his standup special. I did a thing with Hank that I think is coming out soon on his channel. He&#x27;s a really cool guy. He&#x27;s a good good creator. So hopefully that&#x27;s coming out soon. Um here we see a screenshot from one of the shows. Again, this is these production values do not look like a good YouTube podcast. They look like Is it Cake on Netflix, right? So they&#x27;ve mastered they really are spending the time and money to get full legacy value production values. This game show here, Game Changers, is an improv show kind of</p>
<p>like Whose Line Is It Anyways, is my understanding. Um, and improv people love it. Like, it&#x27;s really, really good. It&#x27;s really, really high quality. Um, here&#x27;s another show. They have original cartoons. So, that looks great. Um, this show here is called Very Important People. So, for those who are listening, I guess the right way to explain this, Jesse, is that it&#x27;s a formal interview setting, like kind of a cliche 90s era interview setting. There&#x27;s an interviewer in a pants suit and then the person being interviewed is in a elaborate hot dog costume. The premise of that show is this is a real guest like a known person and the premise of the show is they put</p>
<p>you in elaborate crazy costumes and then they have an interview and you know for whatever reason that works. Um here&#x27;s here&#x27;s another show here. I think that&#x27;s from the Dungeons and Dragons game. So again we we see three comedians around some sort of gaming table where they&#x27;re I don&#x27;t know. I guess they play um and they chat. All right, so I also had Nate send some notes. What was his impression spending time on these shows? Here&#x27;s some things he sent to us. It feels intuitive like any other streamer. You have your trending, continue watching, and dropout originals</p>
<p>categories. I was surprised to find animated originals. The archive is deep. There is a ton of content, even some of the original college humor stuff. They record everything. There&#x27;s so much behindthe-scenes content and additional content. They&#x27;re a relatively small team, so it&#x27;s a smart play to use everything and give their loyal fan base an intimate look into how it all gets made. The overall tone is a mix of nerdy and cheerful. You can find Hank Green science explaining elaborate D and D sets, improv that spans from silly to slapstick to existential and</p>
<p>philosophical, sometimes flippant between the two in the same bit. It knows what it is, who its fan base is, and it delivers. All right, so that&#x27;s Dropout TV, which again is killing it if we&#x27;re talking what, a million subscribers at $7 a month. So here&#x27;s the question I want to ask next. Why is Dropout TV successful? If we can understand what goes into making a micro streamer be able to generate tens of millions of dollars, we&#x27;ll have a better understanding of what&#x27;s going to happen with this trend</p>
<p>going forward in the future. So, I have three properties I want to suggest here. Having spent time listening to Nate and looking at this report and reading articles about this, I have three properties I want to suggest are critical for something like Dropout TV to be successful. And I&#x27;m going to actually uh draw a picture for each of these properties on my virtual blackboard here for people who are watching. So, just listening because well uh I want to punish you. Making you see my drawing is never never the best part of people&#x27;s day, but I like doing it. All right, property number one that</p>
<p>you need to succeed. All right, so here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to draw here. We have a stick figure standing there. Um, and then we got a camera and don&#x27;t laugh. That&#x27;s great, Jesse. I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. And then here&#x27;s a big lighting panel. All right. So, what am I talking about here? What property is this? I&#x27;ll write the word production. Production values. That&#x27;s the thing that we started with. The thing that caught my attention about Masterclass, the thing that I think most obviously differentiates Dropout TV from YouTube, production values. I think</p>
<p>micro streamers need production quality that matches the large legacy uh platforms such as Netflix or such as Disney Plus or uh Masterclass. Now, that&#x27;s expensive. It&#x27;s getting cheaper. Dropout TV is a relatively small team, but you still need they got millions of dollars of investment over the time to actually make this thing play out. So most people, most indie creators won&#x27;t be able to do this, but if the price is low enough that it is not out of the reach for a very successful indie</p>
<p>creator or talented group of people who already have some sort of notoriety or talent or fan base that people already know about. 99.9% of independent content creators can&#x27;t compete in the space. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to be a bad thing because that&#x27;s going to prevent the problem that I think afflicts the free platforms like YouTube, which is crowding. There&#x27;s so much stuff on these platforms because the barrier to entry is so low. It&#x27;s hard for the really good stuff to rise above the noise because for every good show that is on YouTube, right, there&#x27;s going to be a 100,000 weird videos and it&#x27;s all getting mixed</p>
<p>together. So, it&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world that this micro streamer universe is going to have a much smaller number of competing indie creators. You&#x27;re not going to make a play here unless you have a good chance of actually offering something good. And I think that filtering might not be the worst thing. Let&#x27;s take a quick break to hear from some of our sponsors. Here&#x27;s a mistake that a lot of small business owners like myself often make. We think because we&#x27;re not big that we&#x27;ll be ignored by bad actors. But unfortunately, when it comes to digital</p>
<p>attacks, that is not true. Cyber criminals uh know that lean teams often lack the resources to prevent or respond to a breach. What&#x27;s the solution? You need one password. One Password provides simple security to help small teams manage the number one risk that bad actors exploit, weak passwords. It&#x27;s a simple turnkey solution that can be rolled out in hours whether you have a dedicated IT staff or not. And here&#x27;s the thing, one password is designed to meet small teams where they are, but it&#x27;s also built to grow along with your</p>
<p>company. However complex your security needs may get, one password will stay with you every step of the way. So take the first step to better security by securing your team&#x27;s credentials. Find out more at onepass.com/deep. That&#x27;s the number one password.com/deep and start securing every login. I also want to talk about my friends at Cozy Earth. Let me describe the weather in Washington DC where Jesse and I live over the past couple of weeks. And Jesse, I&#x27;m going to use the technical meteorological terms here. Cold as hell.</p>
<p>But you know what made that easier? Cozy Earth. I&#x27;m only exaggerating a little bit when I say between my wife and I, I think we own basically every product that Cozy Earth sells. I&#x27;m talking like their bamboo sheets. It&#x27;s the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever slept in. Their bamboo pajama set, lightweight yet cozy. The cuddle blanket, super popular in our household. It&#x27;s richly plus with a comforting weight. And so many others. This gave us such a sense of warmth and comfort in a time when otherwise we were just freezing. Here&#x27;s the good news. They also now have or they&#x27;ve always had</p>
<p>a 100 night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty so you can enjoy these purchases risk-f free. But you don&#x27;t need it. You&#x27;re going to love it what you buy from them. So why not share a little extra love this February and wrap yourself or someone you care about in comfort that truly feels special. Head to cozyearth.com and use my code deep to get up to 20% off. That&#x27;s code deep for up to 20% off. And if you get a post-purchase survey, be sure to mention you heard about Cozy Earth right here. Celebrate everyday love with comfort that makes the little moments count. All right, Jesse, let&#x27;s get back to the</p>
<p>show. All right, property two that these micro streamers need. And I&#x27;ll draw a picture on here. Um, as always, maybe I&#x27;ll ask Jesse to try to figure out what&#x27;s going on here. I&#x27;ll switch colors. All right. What do you think about this, Jesse? What do you think? &gt;&gt; I like it, but I&#x27;ve also cheated. So, &gt;&gt; you&#x27;ve seen the script, haven&#x27;t you? All right. It&#x27;s a person juggling. And I&#x27;m going to put under here, I&#x27;ll put the word content. Okay. So, the second property these micro streamers need is really good</p>
<p>content. The content has to be undeniably good and it has to pass an important test. It is better than most uh equivalent topic content that you can get for free. Right? I think this is a key part of the micro streamer platform movement is at Dropout TV. People who like comedy say this is the best improv they&#x27;ve seen since the show Whose Line Is It Anyways? So, you can&#x27;t find equivalently good um improv necessarily on YouTube easily.</p>
<p>The shows are really good and funny, right? They&#x27;re edited well. It&#x27;s comedians who know each other, who know the format, who&#x27;ve auditioned, they they put together really good groups of people. It&#x27;s just really high quality to the degree where there&#x27;s not a lot of free equivalents on like on YouTube or something that&#x27;s going to scratch that same inch. So, you have to differentiate yourself with quality in some platform. I mean, in some topics, it&#x27;ll be easier than others. I think this is a problem right now that the maker DIY space is having. There&#x27;s a lot of really good maker DIY content right now on YouTube</p>
<p>for free. And like that, for example, would make it hard if you&#x27;re, you know, Adam Savage or the woman from Nerd Forge to say, &quot;We&#x27;re going to create a micro streamer around maker content.&quot; The problem is is you have really good stuff. You could make the production values better, but it would be hard to differentiate your content. So you have to find an area where by bringing in the right talent and putting in the right effort, you can differentiate yourself. It has to be undeniably good. All right. The third property is something that surprised me. Um I&#x27;ll draw a picture over here. So this is supposed to be</p>
<p>like a big audience of a big audience of people that are then looking up. I don&#x27;t know has a stage up here or something like that. All right. So what I mean by this audience and I&#x27;ll write the the word here. People say my handwriting uh identical to uh Queen Elizabeth, former Queen of of uh England, similar quality. And &gt;&gt; did she have great handwriting? &gt;&gt; I I&#x27;m assuming so. &gt;&gt; I think if Queen Elizabeth wrote something that looks like this that I</p>
<p>have on the screen right now, they would have said, &quot;Well, she clearly had a stroke.&quot; And they would have rushed her off to the hospital. Like clearly she has some sort of neurological damage. Community was the piece that surprised me. So, this is something that Dropout is working on really well. They know their fans. They connect with their fans. They listen to their fans. They respond to their fans. And they create a parasocial relationship with their fans. This is Nate pointed this out and it caught me off guard. They&#x27;ll talk a lot like the the the performers in these shows.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll get personal. It&#x27;ll be really funny and then they&#x27;ll talk about, you know, they&#x27;re dealing with a sickness or like a mental health issue or something hard that&#x27;s going on in their life and their other performers are there to support them and then they&#x27;ll get back and they&#x27;re doing like a really silly bit. So, it moves back and forth between vulnerable and funny. They respond to the fans. They do shows and specials based on like what the fans really like. Nate was telling me that they are going to release Blu-rays of some of their shows just because their fan has a lot</p>
<p>of like TV culture nerd them in it who like the physical things like great we&#x27;ll build these physical things. They have a really great merch shop and they do live events and you could just tell it&#x27;s it&#x27;s tightly intertwined. Also just how they behave. I mentioned before all these like benefits. They pay their performers really well. Um they try to carve out a space where like we&#x27;re we&#x27;re like a co-op type model even if it&#x27;s not technically that. And the audience responds to it. they feel like they&#x27;re a part of a community. Um, I&#x27;m going to go back briefly to the notes. Uh, Nate pulled up some comments from the internet so you can see the way people think about this. I&#x27;m going to read a</p>
<p>couple things. This from a Reddit thread. Their content isn&#x27;t my personal cup of tea, but I am 1,000% on board with what they are doing as a business model, how they&#x27;re treating their creative people. They pay people who audition. Let that sink in. Here&#x27;s another comment. I know I sound like a corporate shill, but they have put in the work. I have never and extremely probably will never interact with anyone on the cast or crew, but from what&#x27;s public, it seems like a good place to work. I hope they are what their social media and public filings portray them to be. So, people are really into the company itself. This is a level of openness and transparency and vulnerability that you don&#x27;t have in the</p>
<p>legacy streamer models where you have a real separation between like the performer and the audience. Dropout TV is having success by uh obscuring those lines. Now, to try to make this a little bit more clear, we track down a a longtime fan of Dropout TV. Uh her name is Megan. And here&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting about this person. She&#x27;s not a big streaming newsletter subscriber, streaming service person. She&#x27;s a professor. This is not She&#x27;s not a big internet person, but she&#x27;s deadly loyal. This is like one of the only things she</p>
<p>pays for monthly is Dropout TV. U So, we got some tape from her explaining what it is about this service that really attracts her. So, I really love the co-op model of dropout. That is something that just from a ethical consumption standpoint, I really, really want to support. But then on top of that, there is all the rewards of what art is produced when artists are paid fairly, have ownership in the things they&#x27;re doing, have really healthy workplaces and support, and then they produce extremely high quality creative work, really uh joyful work that like</p>
<p>speaks to things happening out in the world that are really meaningful as well. So, it&#x27;s a way of processing um the zeitgeist. And so it&#x27;s not necessarily just escapism in like, you know, accessing these really silly skits, but it&#x27;s also a way of processing and not feeling alone. Um, and is exceptional high quality. And the way that it&#x27;s set up is like resulting in the artists who&#x27;ve been hired in in having success outside of dropout alone. So their model of paying people who are even just auditioning is really unique.</p>
<p>Um, and I, yeah, huge fan of both the material and the way that it&#x27;s set up in the world. &gt;&gt; That interesting, Jesse, it&#x27;s like people can&#x27;t even pull apart the like, I love the content. I love the workplace. I love what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s been mixed all together, which I think is a really interesting model. People will pay for video. They&#x27;ll pay for it even more regularly if they feel like this video is a a window into a community that they feel like they&#x27;re a part of. All right. So, let&#x27;s prognosticate. We&#x27;ve looked at this one micro streamer.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s prognosticate. What is going to come next in this movement? Well, first I want to make a point. Not all content, in fact, I would say most content that would is out there now and you can find it on platforms, free platforms like YouTube doesn&#x27;t make sense. Most content does not make sense for micro streamers. All right? So, for example, if you&#x27;re producing like reasonable stuff that has occasional virality, you want to be on a algorithmically curated free platform like YouTube, right? Because that&#x27;s not going to pass the the super high uh</p>
<p>quality bar. It&#x27;s going to be too expensive to pass the production value bar to be a successful micro streamer and you want as many eyeballs as possible. And so, you want to be on a platform where virality can can gain you big eyeballs on a semi-regular basis. On the other end, let&#x27;s say you have really good production values, but you also have a massive audience. So, I&#x27;m thinking like Mr. Beast or Mark Robber. Doesn&#x27;t necessarily make sense for them to have a micro streaming service either because when your audience is that big, you know, Robber has 70 million subscribers, Mr. Beast has se several</p>
<p>hundred million subscribers. When your audiences are that big, actually, the best monetization strategy is to directly sell them your own products. And that&#x27;s what they do. So, you know, Mr. Beast has like Feastables and Beastburgers and Mark Robber has the Crunch Labs. And it turns out that&#x27;s just going to make a lot more money than getting a much smaller fraction of that to pay a smaller subscription fee. Um, and again, the other thing that&#x27;s going to struggle, like we talked about before, is content that you could make really good, that you could have really good production values, but there&#x27;s a lot of really, really good free</p>
<p>equivalents already out there, and then it&#x27;s just hard. Again, this is the this is the DIY problem. I I think about at the end of his TV run, the maker, former Mythbuster, Adam Savage, had a show called Savage Builds, and it was like a great traditionally produced, high-end production value maker show where he&#x27;d have a crazy project and him and a team would build the project, right? That show didn&#x27;t work. And in part, the reason why it didn&#x27;t work is because by that point, you had people doing equivalently crazy projects with maybe</p>
<p>the production values weren&#x27;t quite there, but just as interesting maker projects on YouTube for free. And it was sort of the end of maker stuff on cable TV because you had people doing these huge projects for free on YouTube and it became hard to separate the two. Interesting fact, Jesse, the director of my master class uh directed like half of the episodes of Mythbusters. So, she knows those guys really well. All the things connect. All right. So, what is the future though? What do I predict is going to happen? All right. I have a few points here I&#x27;m going to throw out there. I&#x27;m going to look into my crystal</p>
<p>ball. I do think there will be a micro streamer boom. A lot of money is going to come into this. A lot of private investment money. U there will be a mini bust as well. A lot of these things are not going to work, but we&#x27;re going to shake it out to have like a pretty stable ecosystem of micro streamers at the end of that boom bus cycle. I don&#x27;t know how many. I&#x27;m going to say less than 200. I mean, more than 200, less than 5,000. That&#x27;d be my best guess, right? And so, what we&#x27;re going to have is a situation where, you know, a lot of people might subscribe to three to five micro streamers in addition to like a</p>
<p>one or two of the big streamers. This might sound like crazy, but it&#x27;s not crazy if you think about how many people are already subscribing to like three or five substacks, which is just text. We&#x27;re talking the same amount of money. But for now, a chicklet or app that can be on your Apple TV next to Netflix that gives you really high quality u indistinguishable from the streamers, hard to find elsewhere content that has a real sense of community. I think we&#x27;re just going to find a lot of people like, &quot;Yeah, I have a few of those on my uh smart TV.&quot; So, we&#x27;re going to have maybe a few thousand</p>
<p>of these. They&#x27;re these are going to be multi-million dollars. Usually like eight figure year revenue, not nine figure year revenue type companies and that&#x27;s just going to become a part of the entertainment experience. I&#x27;m trying to think about like examples of what could be there. So like Joe Rogan is someone who could probably have a a successful micro streamer because you could imagine what would that app give you? Well, it would be I don&#x27;t know certain episodes of his show that aren&#x27;t otherwise available. maybe like certain types of episodes like the Protect Our Park episodes where he&#x27;s joking around with his comedian friends, but then he</p>
<p>could put a lot of standup from his comedy club could be on there as well. So, you could see all these clips, new clips every every week from standup comics. Then he could probably put a camera in his green room and kind of have a regular show of like comics that are just sort of BSing in the green room. And then maybe I think he&#x27;s bu he&#x27;s building a ranch outside of Austin. I could imagine some sort of show where him and other comedians like they go hunting or something. and whatever. Like you could imagine an ecosystem there. It&#x27;s like $10 million uh a year, $20 million a year investment to run this thing makes $100 million. Like that type</p>
<p>of thing is going to be more likely. Uh if we did deep questions TV, Jesse, I think we would have conservatively 20 hours of skeleton footage each week. I think conservatively um there&#x27;d be a show that&#x27;s just me doing accents, which I think would be popular. Um, and a weekly series that&#x27;s called Cal Network Lifts Things. And it would just be Cal Network lifting absurdly heavy things while women clap. &gt;&gt; Not like uproariously, but just like Yeah. Well done. &gt;&gt; And a show of you trying to improve your handwriting like the queen.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, there would be a show. It would be called Cal or Queen &gt;&gt; and and they would show handwriting on it and then you would have to guess was it written by me or Queen Elizabeth, the former queen of England. it be that that would also be uh a popular micro streamer. So, we&#x27;ll have to get on that. We just need if anyone wants to invest $20 million, we could deliver this like tomorrow. All right. So, what&#x27;s our assessment of this? Is this micro streamer revolution I&#x27;m protecting a good thing? I think yes. A few things I want to point out here. A, it&#x27;s non-algorithmic, which is music to my ears. When you have a subscription service, what is your</p>
<p>incentive as the provider of content? Delighting your audience, giving them the best possible experience. You don&#x27;t really time on device doesn&#x27;t matter. You&#x27;re not going to initify and do all sorts of weird ads and data mining. You want that to be the best possible experience that&#x27;s better for consumers. Non-algorithmic content is not addictive content. Non-algorithmic content can have much higher quality in a sort of almost literary type of creative sense, right? Like it&#x27; be more uplifting. And I think some of these dropout TV shows are way more interesting to consume. Top-notch improv with real vulnerability</p>
<p>and interesting people than like a Tik Tok video of, you know, someone getting kicked in the nuts. Oh, that could be another episode of our on our streaming channel, just constantly finding people and kicking them in the nuts. I guess that would do really well. So, I think that&#x27;s good. Another good thing about this revolution, it injects money into the class of skilled creative people, which I think is vitally important for any sort of advanced culture or society. You need a whole substrate of highly talented creative people. It should be hard to make it into that substrate. You really got to be good. But there should be an economic means to support people</p>
<p>who are really good at comedy and writing or doing the skilled trades that surround producing high production quality video. I was actually one of the sadder the something that was sort of sad about my masterclass experience is like everyone there was coming out of movies and this was one of the only gigs in town because all the movie productions all overseas now because you can produce your movies overseas for half the cost. So all these skilled trades people are running out of work. So I think that is really good. I think it&#x27;s more important to have a an internet entertainment ecosystem that supports a sort of uh middle class of</p>
<p>skilled creative professionals. To me, that&#x27;s much more important than what we have now, which is an internet creative ecosystem that supports like a small number of 24y old influencers and like everyone else makes no money. That&#x27;s not that useful to a society. The existence of Jake Paul is not that critical for a functioning society, but you lose all of the, you know, highly skilled humor writers. I think that is a real loss that you&#x27;re gonna feel. So, I think that&#x27;s good as well. I also think it undermines the massive social platforms,</p>
<p>which again is a good thing because I really dislike those platforms. And I&#x27;ve been making this argument. I always go back to that New Yorker piece I wrote in 2023 on Tik Tok and the fall of the social media giants. But as soon as all those social media giants said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to follow the Tik Tok model of algorithmically curated short form video, not social networks, not giving you information from people you follow or your friends, but just showing you the most compelling possible things.&quot; I said that was the day they sealed their death warrant because now they&#x27;re just competing with everything else that can offer entertainment. And I think micro streamers when it matches your interest</p>
<p>when it&#x27;s a community that you like that is going to be something that is going to be more compelling than let me just fall back on Instagram and watch my tradife Instagram I don&#x27;t know fitness influencer kick someone in the nuts or whatever&#x27;s going on in Instagram. So, I think in general, knock on wood, if I&#x27;m right about this, it&#x27;s a good thing. I think that&#x27;s good for the future of media, and I&#x27;m excited for some of the micro streamers that are going to enter my life and give me better highquality entertainment to watch in a way that I am happy to be watching it. So, there you go. Had you heard of Dropout TV?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I had never heard of it either. &gt;&gt; So, none of those people on Dropout TV, do they have a presence on YouTube as well? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. They probably do. Yeah, they probably put clips on YouTube to promote it. I think I heard something like that. Yeah. So, they&#x27;re on there, but uh they were entirely on YouTube and they&#x27;re like, &quot;This is a pain and that&#x27;s why they move over to the micro streamer.&quot; &gt;&gt; Even so, even with the revenue sharing that they get from they got from YouTube, &gt;&gt; um yeah, I don&#x27;t think they were making enough money from that. Not comp I mean, they weren&#x27;t going to make $70 million a year on YouTube,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; which they&#x27;re able to do here. They&#x27;re growing now. I was I was doing a lot of reading in like Variety and other Hollywood centric newspapers. They&#x27;re now hiring professional like producers and entertainment executives from like TV networks and streamers and stuff like that. So, it&#x27;s sort of it&#x27;s growing out, but it&#x27;s still a very small team compared to anything else for which you might have an app on your TV, but once you click it, you can&#x27;t tell the difference. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s exciting to me. Once you can&#x27;t tell the difference, it doesn&#x27;t mean automatically you&#x27;ll be successful, but it means you as an independent now have a shot at being successful in</p>
<p>that type of pay media ecosystem. So, I think it&#x27;s a bigger deal than people realize, but we shall see. All right, we&#x27;re going to take another quick break to hear from some of our sponsors. Men, let me level with you. We need to take better care of our skin. And here&#x27;s the way to do it with the help of Calira Lab. Calira Lab makes high performance skin care designed specifically for men&#x27;s skin. More importantly, they&#x27;ve simplified the use of their products into a straightforward three-step routine. Step one, you use the clean</p>
<p>slate, a cleanser to clear dirt, oil, and sweat off of your skin. Step two, use the great, which is a serum clinically proven to reduce wrinkles um and improve elasticity. And then step three, use the hydrolayer moisturizer to lock in moisture all day. That&#x27;s it. I have all three products, so I can tell you from experience, this routine is simple and it&#x27;s fast, but it works. Especially the moisturizing. Uh, I&#x27;m so used to my skin feeling like sandpaper in the winter that I was amazed to learn that it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. Use moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t know about this. Women know about this. I didn&#x27;t know</p>
<p>about this. So, go to calderab.com/deep and use code deep to get 20% off your first order. Starting a new business is hard.

All right, so uh that&#x27;s what we got for our ideas section. I think we&#x27;ll move on now to talk practices. Earlier this year, I switched to a new task management app. It&#x27;s called Things 3. I</p>
<h2>Why Cal Spent $60 on a Task App?</h2>
<p>spent $10 to buy a copy for my phone and then I spent $50 to buy a copy for my Mac. I can&#x27;t actually remember the last time I spent that much money on a piece of software. Um, but that&#x27;s what you have to do with things three. There&#x27;s no free version. It&#x27;s not a monthly subscription fee. If you want it on a device, you buy a copy for that device. Now, I want to talk briefly today about why I spent $60 on a task app because I think the reason is more generally relevant than just why I like this app. And it gets to a a core point about how to successfully</p>
<p>use technology to help organize your life. All right. So, I&#x27;m going to load up on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening, a screenshot of things three in action. So, what we see over here is a list of different areas. There&#x27;s an inbox today, upcoming. Below here, what you see is areas like family, work, and hobbies. And here they have these circles are list that exist under the different areas. You don&#x27;t have to have project list under areas. You can just have standalone tasks. I do that. Um, if we look at the actual task pane, we see</p>
<p>here a particular list called prepare presentation, and there&#x27;s a bunch of tasks. These tasks have been divided into sub areas. I don&#x27;t do that, but you can do that if you want. And that&#x27;s about it. A couple little features to notice. Some uh tasks have a star, meaning it&#x27;s something that you said you wanted to work on that day. Others have a date next to them, meaning that you have an upcoming deadline. Uh, one other view here, this shows what happens if you click the today tab, which is very or very nice. It shows you all the tasks for whatever list and whatever areas they had clicked the star on saying you want to work on that particular day. You</p>
<p>see them all in one place. That&#x27;s basically it with things three. So what about this made me want to spend $60? There&#x27;s one feature in particular that they emphasize that I think is critical. Reducing friction. they have minimized the effort, time and clicks involved in going from a task in mind to a task in system or to see task in your system in front of you. There&#x27;s all sorts of sort of intuitive shortcuts that they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve perfected over the years. You hit spacebar and you can just</p>
<p>start typing. If you want to set a date, you like click on the calendar and it pops up right there and you click on it. So the interface is beautiful. What they don&#x27;t emphasize which a lot of other task applications do is features. If you look at the web pages for a lot of other popular task apps, they try to overwhelm you with feature after feature that they offer all these complicated integrations. You could do this, you could do that. You could integrate these apps with your task app. And what&#x27;s going to happen is that you will automatically get sent a notice to your Apple Watch if you happen to walk past this billboard on the vernal equinox and then your notion board will capture it</p>
<p>and send it to an LLM after which uh the mouse trap falls and you get trapped under the cage. like they&#x27;re always pushing all these different features. And I get why that&#x27;s compelling because you&#x27;re like, &quot;Wow, these are all things I could do that could make my app more powerful.&quot; But here&#x27;s what I learned in my two decades of thinking and writing about the intersection of productivity and technology. Features are not the problem. The number one problem people have with any sort of task management system is they stop using them. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many cool features and integration your tools have if you don&#x27;t use them.</p>
<p>And so the number one problem that you want to avoid if trying to use technology to organize your life is to stop using the technology. This is where friction enters the scene. It is the number one reason why people give up with a tool over time. When you&#x27;re first using it, there&#x27;s a little bit of friction. You got to do a couple clicks here to enter a task. I have to I can&#x27;t really see the full title of this task until I click on the card and then I see the whole thing. When you&#x27;re first using the app, that&#x27;s not a big deal. like, okay, whatever. It&#x27;s a couple extra clicks, but the point is, look at all</p>
<p>these cool features. But over time, that friction begins to add up and it generates more and more heat until it gets too hot for the system as a whole to run. It&#x27;s when you&#x27;re tired. It&#x27;s when you&#x27;re busy. It&#x27;s when you&#x27;re in a hurry that that friction becomes more and more annoying until you finally say, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do those clicks anymore. I&#x27;ll just keep track of this in my head.&quot; Or like send an email to myself and the system is out of your life. So we think about task technology wrong. We think about features when we should be thinking about friction because by</p>
<p>far the largest expected value that you&#x27;re going to get from a task uh tool. The largest expected value will be from the simple tool you use for a long time. That is a larger amount of aggregate value than a fancy tool that you do great things with but only for a few weeks. And so that is why I like things is the friction is so low. It makes it as easy as possible to use. I actually looked this up Jesse. I first started talking about reducing friction in task task tools back in 2006. &gt;&gt; 2006 &gt;&gt; 2006 in my second book which was called the Da Vinci Code.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t be in this dump if that was my book. I&#x27;d be podcasting from a golden throne. No, in my uh second book, which was almost as pos popular as the Da Vinci Code, uh how to become a straight Ara student. Actually, here&#x27;s a connection to the Da Vinci Code. There&#x27;s a real one. I remember because I I have a bad memory for most things except books. I remember every book I&#x27;ve read and where I was for whatever reason. And I remember exactly where I was reading I read the Da Vinci Code. It would have been the summer of 2003. I was staying at a friend&#x27;s house in New Jersey, northern New Jersey. I can</p>
<p>remember the room I was reading the Da Vinci. They had a copy there and I started reading it. During that trip, the thing I kept checking on is uh the proposal for my first book. So I was a finished my junior year in college, how to win a college was out to publishers that summer. And so while I was reading the Da Vinci Code in Northern New Jersey in the summer of 2003, I was waiting to hear back had we sold my first book. So it all kind of connects together. Anyways, the next year I wrote how to become a straight A student. And in my section about how to manage your task as a</p>
<p>student, it&#x27;s all focused on reducing friction. It was a system I invented. I had no computers involved. You ripped a sheet of paper out of a notebook and kept in your pocket all day and then you used your digital calendar you already had as a place where you stored everything. And I was really clear. This is the simplest possible system I could come up with because you don&#x27;t need features. Your problem is not that you don&#x27;t have a sufficiently complicated task management system. Your problem is you don&#x27;t have a task management system. And if I want you to have one, I got to make it so simple that even when you&#x27;re hung over and you&#x27;re rushing the class, you&#x27;re still going to use it. So from the very beginning of my professional career, thinking about this intersection</p>
<p>of technology and productivity, friction is what I cared about. That&#x27;s why I like things 3. They care about it, too. And it&#x27;s so important to me that I was willing to pay $60 for it. So there we go. Things three, Jesse, I recommend it. &gt;&gt; So are you still using Trello? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not right now. I&#x27;m not right now. There are certain things I do where Trello is the right tool. In particular, if it&#x27;s a complicated project with multiple people involved, Trello is the right tool because you need the ability to have easy sharing of your workspace with other people. You need the ability to attach voluminous information to</p>
<p>individual cards. That&#x27;s critical, I think, for team collaboration. Oh, here is the text of this email. Here&#x27;s a PDF of the report. So, all the stuff you need to execute a task lives on the same card that everyone sees and can update. Uh so Trello was you know very useful when I was working on team projects. I&#x27;m not right now. Most of what I&#x27;m doing is in my sort of uh deep work pain cave of you know books and articles and all this type of stuff that&#x27;s just uh individual effort and I was all kind of crowding onto each other and so I had to fall back onto my roots. Friction friction</p>
<p>friction. So right now my trell is waiting there and I&#x27;ll use it again as I get to my next larger collaborative project. But for my personal stuff man I&#x27;m just reducing the friction. So then you check the app on your phone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have it on my phone and I have it on my Mac on my laptop. So, and then they sync. So you can synchronize, they have a service, uh, a cloud service that you can synchronize your various copies, each of which you paid for full retail. You can synchronize them so that the changes go between them. &gt;&gt; So $60 times two? &gt;&gt; No, because it was 50 for the Mac. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; And 10 for the phone. &gt;&gt; Oh,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; yeah. It&#x27;s 20 for the iPad. Yeah. But if I want to put it on like the computer here, more. &gt;&gt; Well, another 50 more. Yeah, it could add up. I love it though. &gt;&gt; Also, you spend money for This is stupid, but it&#x27;s true. You spend money for something, you take it more seriously. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, um anyways, I&#x27;m like, and it&#x27;s not an ad for things three. I don&#x27;t know the culture code people. Uh but there you go. So, friction matters. All right, Jesse, let&#x27;s move on to questions. &gt;&gt; Hi, the first question is from Alex. I work in a clerical position from to</p>
<h2>How can I find time to become a Biblical scholar?</h2>
<p>5 each day. I want to become a biblical scholar on the side. How should I do this? &gt;&gt; What do you think he means? I wonder, Jesse, like does he mean I want to be able to like in I have two definitions. I want to be able to No, I&#x27;m going to give three definitions. Let&#x27;s do three definitions. Easiest definition. I want to be able to uh engage with English translations of the Bible in a sort of sophisticated way like reading commentary and stuff like this. Number two, option. Option number two, I want</p>
<p>to be able to engage with the Bible in the original language. So, for the Hebrew Bible, you&#x27;re learning biblical Hebrew and for the New Testament, you&#x27;re learning Greek, but just so that you can um have a deeper engagement with the text. Option number three is option two plus you want to do originally schol scholarly research on the Bible. So, there&#x27;s three different options for what he could mean here. He didn&#x27;t elaborate. He actually emailed me. &gt;&gt; All right. So, could you get more details here? &gt;&gt; He he did not elaborate. &gt;&gt; He did not elaborate. Okay. Well, the</p>
<p>first the first option, which I think is a very reasonable place to start. This is a great side project, sort of like personal development side project where, you know, you get a what I would do is I would get like a reading list. I&#x27;m going to go through these books. I&#x27;m going to go back and um you know, maybe I&#x27;m going to go back and I&#x27;m going to reread these sections through the light of these books. or you can follow through uh the Bible over a particular period of time depending on what scope of the Bible you want to read. It can take a lot of years to get through the even the whole Hebrew Bible. Most of the cycles I&#x27;ve seen take like three or four years. If you&#x27;re interested in just the first five books,</p>
<p>what the Jews would call the Torah, you can that&#x27;s split up regularly into a single year. You have a para every week. Um that&#x27;s not so hard to follow. So have some sort of curriculum of reading and studying. I&#x27;ve done a lot of biblical scholarship in the last couple of years. um this type of amateur just like reading these books and reading these elements I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you could do that tomorrow just put aside half hour a day and you can make progress learning biblical Hebrew that option there&#x27;s people who do this right like but who are uh lay sc meaning like non-academics who do this there&#x27;s courses that can</p>
<p>help you right especially uh Hebrew biblical Hebrew because like in the Jewish communities there&#x27;s like a good thing to learn how to read, you know, the Bible in in Hebrew. So, there&#x27;s lots of courses and it takes a while. I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard, but this could be a two-year project to like I can actually read and kind of understand. I mean, I think you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re not going to be able to do uh like an alter style level of uh translation or Richard Elliot, like people who just spend their entire life getting the nuances of the language, but you could pron you could kind of read and understand it. And I</p>
<p>think there&#x27;s some value in that. That&#x27;s a two-year project. If you want to be able to read and understand to the point where you could do scholarly work, like you probably would need to learn the languages and then you would need to probably go to school part-time. So give a year or so to learn the languages and do like a two-year you probably would do like a divinity masters, theology masters part-time. So this might be like a five to eight year project. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s crazy. This is like a core idea from slow productivity. something taking a long time is not a</p>
<p>problem. If it&#x27;s important to you and you enjoy the process and in this case you feel like it&#x27;s I don&#x27;t know purifying your soul or something why not have that say this decade this is going to be a structuring element of my life. So I&#x27;m not worried about any of these options taking a long time. In fact I&#x27;m going to say I like that all these options take a long time. Sticking disciplined and with diligence to things that are important and take time is a uh really good way of orienting yourself in the world and finding value. So, you should do it, Alex. Whatever option you&#x27;re looking at, I say do it. All right. What&#x27;s our next question?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Next question is from Brett. I know you lean toward AI skepticism, but someone</p>
<h2>Should I freak out about this AI Superintelligence article?</h2>
<p>recently sent my wife and I this article, and it sort of freaked us out. Can you help us figure out what, if anything, in this argument isn&#x27;t right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I have the the article here that Brett sent. The title was, &quot;We&#x27;re not ready for AI super intelligence.&quot; I&#x27;m not going to read the whole article. Let me read the intro and then I summarize. I can summarize the points of the article and then I&#x27;ll react to it. So the intro to the article says, &quot;There&#x27;s no shortage of dystopian views of the future, but this one might be worth your time. Basically, it&#x27;s a step-by-step visualization of where we&#x27;re taking artificial intelligence development and technology, projecting</p>
<p>it out logically into the future into a future which could end the ex with the extinction of the human race.&quot; It says the what? If that sounds implausible and stupidly pessimistic, it might help to follow the steps from here to there and think about which of them you disagree with. So the gauntlet is laid down in this intro to this article. Hey, every step in here is pretty logical. So like this might sound like the endpoint&#x27;s crazy, but you got you tell me where there&#x27;s an illogical step. All right, so I took on that challenge and the answer</p>
<p>of where are there illogical steps everywhere in this article. There are so many mistakes in this article. I don&#x27;t think that was the flex they thought when they said see if you can find something that is illogical. Uh the whole thing is pretty illogical. I actually think this article is just cribed from project um AI 2027. This is very familiar. Uh I&#x27;m teaching a doctoral seminar on super intelligence right now at Georgetown. So we&#x27;re reading a lot of the uh we read a lot of the source documents for the current conception of super intelligence including that and who the people were and how their views evolved. And so I recognize a lot of this. I&#x27;m just going</p>
<p>to summarize really quickly this the story here at a high level. Then I&#x27;ll tell you what the flaw is. So basically the way this goes is it says okay we have the AI that we have now which is like cool but seems kind of harmless. Then it says but the next AI iteration is 100 times as smart, fast as powerful and the one after that is a thousand times as powerful. And their argument is just recursive self-improvement. Like we get 100 times more powerful and now the AI can just start improving itself. Um, and then they scale the quantity of chips and like, well, what if we have 50,000 of these really smart AIs? Now it&#x27;s like having 50,000 scientists all</p>
<p>working on trying to make the next AI better and we we lose control of it. That&#x27;s the story line. This is not unique to this article. I can tell you as someone again who&#x27;s studying super intelligence from a cultural and technological view in a doctoral seminar, this is the standard argument for super intelligence. Scaling up of ability, scaling up of quantity, control lost. What step here is illogical? We don&#x27;t know how to do either of those scalings. I we do not know how to make AI twice as good as it is right now. Nonetheless, 100 times as good. This is not a simple matter of just give it more</p>
<p>time and more energy and it keeps going up some type of curve. It is hard to make better AIs. Now, there was a brief window into language models where we had a tool that got us from here to here. This is called pre-training scaling. It got us from 2 to 3, 3 to 3.5, and 3.5 to four just by making the actual size of the models and the amount of time we trained them bigger. They got better, but that only gave us a relatively constrained improvement from two to four. After that, as I I uh I talked about this last August in my article for the New Yorker called, you know, what if</p>
<p>AI doesn&#x27;t get much better than this? Pre-training scaling began to stall out. Most of the quote unquote improvements in straight language model performance we&#x27;ve gotten since the the stall out after GPT4 comes from post-training which is tuning these existing pre-trained models to do good on very specific tester metrics. It&#x27;s not nearly as impressive as to big systemic leaps in ability we got from pre-training scaling. So now that&#x27;s kind of where we are now is finding particular uses where we can get the right data sets to use reinforcement learning techniques to get these fine-tuning improvements on very narrow performance areas. So we&#x27;re kind</p>
<p>of tinkering with the car and don&#x27;t know how to actually make it substantially better. So how are we going to get you can&#x27;t just casually say yeah you know over the next few years this will get a hundred times better and then what&#x27;ll happen? We don&#x27;t know how to make it 100 times better. We also don&#x27;t know how to do recursive self-improvement. These models are trained on things that they&#x27;ve already seen. There&#x27;s a little bit of minor generalization from the distributions but pretty much they&#x27;re working with rules and patterns that they&#x27;re exposed to in training. If you haven&#x27;t trained an AI on how to build an even better AI, it can&#x27;t do that. There is no notion of like just if we</p>
<p>keep magically training these things, it&#x27;ll eventually be able to make better things. That&#x27;s the same thing as saying like look man, uh we went from propeller planes to fast propeller planes and then we had jet planes that are going faster. Um, so within a few years we&#x27;ll probably be traveling like roughly 100,000 mph. And at that point there&#x27;s these other issues we have to deal with like no, we don&#x27;t know how to get from 700 to 100,000 mph. We&#x27;re kind of tapped out. We don&#x27;t have the technology for it. We don&#x27;t know what technology could do that. So don&#x27;t be uh too taken in by scaling arguments. Demand that people</p>
<p>talk about actual technologies that exist today or imminently are coming in the near future and their concrete implications. Do not react to extrapolation. So much of this type of AI vibe coverage that we see in articles like this is really people creating an extrapolation that&#x27;s unverified by what we actually know is possible and then they react to their own extrapolation and they&#x27;re like how can you not be worried about my story I wrote but again it&#x27;s like if I tell you some story where like planes are getting faster and then we all turn into ghosts and I&#x27;m like why could how are you not</p>
<p>upset about us all becoming ghosts? you like because we&#x27;re not all going to become ghosts and we don&#x27;t know how to make planes much faster. It&#x27;s kind of a weird mixed metaphor there, Jesse. It&#x27;s really actually very deep. I just can&#x27;t get into all the details of why. Just trust me, that&#x27;s actually a very deep anecdote. Um, so Brett, there&#x27;s a lot of concerns about AI that I have. Super intelligence is not one of them. Again, I&#x27;m studying this very closely both culturally and technologically. This is not something that serious computer scientists are worried about. Yes, I know ones that are in the news like kind of make these cryptic statements about being worried about AI. there&#x27;s their own type of politics and agenda is going there. But let me tell</p>
<p>you behind the scenes, people who actually are not being quoted by reporters and work on this technology. There is not a path here that anyone serious is actually worried about. That&#x27;s what I would say about that. I&#x27;m reading too much about this these days, Jesse, but super intelligence is just not it&#x27;s not a serious concern. It was a interestingly the very first people to write about the even computers brought up this fear. We went back and read things early. Alan Turring worried about this. John Vonoyman talking about the singularity. Uh Norbert Weiner</p>
<p>talking about things getting out of control. Uh Jay Good is the one who actually invented the idea of recursive self-improvement. He called it ultra intelligence of the 60s. One of these like information theory head guys. Um also was very worried about so as soon as we had the idea of a computer, we got worried. What if these things kept getting better and take over? So it goes back to the very first people writing about computers. It&#x27;s interesting. &gt;&gt; So this is a course this semester. &gt;&gt; Yeah. first time you had this course. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so Georgetown has these things called doctoral seminars where it&#x27;s just doctoral students. They&#x27;re reading courses like you&#x27;re reading cutting edge work and um trying to have original</p>
<p>thought. So, I have 10 students that are all doing research on AI in some capacity or the other. And then we&#x27;re doing this the the cool thing we&#x27;re doing inspired by John Height&#x27;s research uh group at NYU. We are creating a collaborative work document which is a um annotated bibliography of all these papers we&#x27;re reading organized by section where you get like the summary of like who wrote this paper, when did it come out, what&#x27;s it about, what&#x27;s interesting about it, what are the flaws about it, um and how does it connect? And we&#x27;re going to have this, we&#x27;re building out this really big collaborative work document of all these papers so that people who are doing</p>
<p>research or writing or journalists who are thinking about super intelligence can have this big guide to like the relevant papers and uh what to read and who to talk to. So we we&#x27;ll have a pretty cool work product that comes out of it when we&#x27;re done. &gt;&gt; And then after you&#x27;re done, are you going to see if Jad GPT can do the same thing? &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, that&#x27;ll be No, what I&#x27;m going to do, and I think this will be fascinating, is I&#x27;m going to read it on the podcast, all 400 pages of it. I&#x27;d be like, uh, citation number 17, then I&#x27;ll read through like where it appeared. That&#x27;s what people want to hear. All right. Uh, we like to close out the show</p>
<p>talking about what I&#x27;m reading. A book I finished last week. This is why I was</p>
<h2>Cal gives his weekly reading update</h2>
<p>interested in Alex&#x27;s question about becoming a biblical scholar is I finished reading Richard Elliot&#x27;s book, The Hidden Book in the Bible. Richard Elliott&#x27;s one of my favorite biblical scholars. Um, he&#x27;s like one of these critical biblical uh scholar uh studies scholars. critical biblical analysis studies scholar. These are the people it goes all the way back to the Germans in the 1800s who study the linguistic characteristics of the Hebrew Bible uh and by the characteristics of the text can actually break it up into different writers. And so like you have your primary writers of the early books of the Hebrew Bible they call the</p>
<p>Yahwehist, the priestly source and the Deuteronomist. There&#x27;s some other sources as well. Um, anyways, he has this argument in this book that actually the Yahwehist wrote many more parts of the Hebrew Bible than he&#x27;s often given credit for or she he actually has an argu could be either. He&#x27;s there&#x27;s reason to believe it could be a woman. Um, I think Bloom was much more bigger on this idea, much more definitive about it where Elliot&#x27;s like, &quot;We just don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s possible. There&#x27;s various reasons why, which is interesting.&quot; Um, anyways, Elliott is arguing that Yahweh&#x27;s contributions to the Bible goes beyond the things he&#x27;s most known for in</p>
<p>like Genesis and that what he did in this book is he took all of the text from the Bible that he thinks was written by this one writer and just put it together into one independent story, uh, an original translation he did. And he says when you see it all together, he&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like a majestic work of literature because it one not only does it flow from one story to the other, but there&#x27;s all these echoes and callbacks to same things happen like again and again and you see like the stories and the repeated themes and it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s pretty cool. I mean I&#x27;ve never read the whole Hebrew Bible before. So this is not all of it because it&#x27;s just the</p>
<p>contributions of the Yahweh, but it&#x27;s like many of the main stories. Um, and so it was kind of like interesting to follow this one through line. Like I didn&#x27;t have I didn&#x27;t know a lot of the stories that happened sort of post um Joshua going into Canaan. I sort of know the first five books pretty well, but like all of the war story section, all of the like we killed all the whatever um David and Saul and uh it&#x27;s these stories I kind of knew, but I&#x27;d never heard them all. &gt;&gt; Is it a beast of a book? &gt;&gt; Uh it&#x27;s a bit of a beast of a book.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, you know, it&#x27;s not crazy. It&#x27;s like 400 something pages. &gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;ve remembered every book you&#x27;ve ever read. &gt;&gt; I mean, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true. I just have like a really strong There&#x27;s certain things I have a strong memory for. And one of the things I have a strong memory for is books that they imprint on me in a way where I not always, but I often if I get a book, I can remember the various places I read it. Um, this was very I also have a I don&#x27;t have a photographic memory, but I have like a there&#x27;s a word for it where if I read something, especially if I&#x27;m if I&#x27;m like I read over something and I</p>
<p>explain it out loud, like do a little active recall, I can often will remember I can remember long um portions of pros and so like when I would take tests and stuff, you know, uh, at Dartmouth, I could remember like whole passages from studying and I could kind of replicate them when I was doing the the blue book. So I I have something I have like the linguistic memory or part of my brain is whatever it is. But but yeah, I have a a stronger memory for that than almost anything. So I don&#x27;t know. I remember I remember books. I sometimes get things wrong, but that&#x27;s one of my better</p>
<p>memories. All right. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m reading. I&#x27;m reading also I have like four books in progress right now. So there&#x27;s going to be like one week where they all finish. It&#x27;s like did you read four books last week? But I I I&#x27;m reading a lot of books in parallel, making a little bit of progress on each. So, like all those dams are going to break all at once, I think, and I&#x27;m just come back and have like a ton of books. &gt;&gt; So, now that we&#x27;re given like a little different structure to the reading component of the show, are we just going to assume that you read five books a month, or you going to like summarize them at some point? &gt;&gt; Um, I don&#x27;t want to talk about them twice. I thought it was nicer just to talk each week about what I read that</p>
<p>week. Internally, &gt;&gt; we&#x27;ll just have faith that you&#x27;re reading five a week. &gt;&gt; Well, no, you can count. Just count the segments. Go through the segments and count up. Um, I still do five a month. That&#x27;s what I aim for still. &gt;&gt; No, I don&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; Yeah, five or more. But yeah, you&#x27;re going to have to actually go back and count count up what&#x27;s happening in the segments now. All right, speaking of which, that&#x27;s all the time we have for today. Be back next week with another episode. And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, if you like today&#x27;s discussion of micro streamers, I think you might also like episode 387, which was titled, &quot;Can Substack Save Journalism?&quot; It&#x27;s another</p>
<p>look at a major trend in this new media landscape. Check it out. I think you&#x27;ll like it. Is it possible that paid email newsletter subscriptions might be the foundation on which we can build a new type of professional journalism?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Can Movies Save Us From Our Phones? | Reclaim Your Attention | Cal Newport</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wZiC4g3GPo</link>
      <description>Cal Newport explains if movies can save us from our phones in episode 393 of the Deep Questions podcast.

Last month, the Atlantic reported that film students are now struggling to sit through entire films. In this episode, Cal argues that this is both an issue and an opportunity. The fact we can’t watch full movies indicates the impact of digital tools on our brains is worse than we assumed. But in this problem we also find a solution: maybe teaching ourselves to become better movie watchers can be the first step to reclaiming our own minds. Cal then dissects a viral AI essay that seems to have everyone worried (spoiler: Cal’s not impressed), reads a reader note about social media and the Olympics and gives an update on his next book project.
