With a card-based insurance program by Visa and Stripe Issuing, Barkibu helps make quality animal healthcare more accessible for their customers by eliminating the traditional reimbursement model\u2014so pet owners no longer have to pay up front and wait for reimbursement.\n\nLearn more about Barkibu: https://stripe.com/customers/barkibu", "transcript_html": "<h2>Transcript</h2>\n<p>In the backpack is Minerva. She loves going out and about, exploring with me and, in her favorite spots, she\u2019s the absolute queen. Gideon, he snores and he barks really loud when he\u2019s asleep. Yes, you do. Cannelle, she has a very unique personality. Smart, a little sassy. CANNELLE! She comes back when she wants to. Barkibu is a pet insurance company.</p>\n<p>Animals feel and they transmit that to you, and they help you. She\u2019s called Fenki. Say hi, Fenki. There\u2019s Lemmy. This is Michimoni. Lemmy! This is Max. Lemmy! One thing that Lemmy likes a lot is escaping, too. He\u2019s a little Houdini. The fact that we work with this love for animals I think this helps us connect deeply with many pet parents. We work hard to give them the best product so that they can take care of veterinary expenses and, as a result, enjoy a healthy pet for a long time.</p>\n<p>Visa and Stripe Issuing have allowed us to be able to develop this card product and to be able to really fulfill our mission to help more animals. When you pay with this card at the vet, you don\u2019t pay out of pocket, but rather Barkibu pays and then charges you for what is not covered. It\u2019s a sense of security. We can go on adventures. If something were to happen, they\u2019re covered. I don\u2019t need to worry if there\u2019s enough money in my account. They take care of everything.</p>\n<p>She&#x27;s my priority, my only thought. A cat! The best financial partner we found was Stripe precisely because they offered us flexibility, iterating very fast. This helped us a lot to test new things with them like the card. With the Barkibu card, we donate 3% of each transaction. We donate it to the pet parent, and they donate it to a shelter. We are launching in new countries.</p>\n<p>I would love that Barkibu grows much more in all countries helping the largest number of pets as possible with this card system. It would be so cool.</p>", "chapters_count": 0}
