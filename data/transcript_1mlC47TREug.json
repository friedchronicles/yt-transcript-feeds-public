British authorities are reportedly investigating whether he shared confidential trade information with Epstein after Epstein\u2019s 2008 conviction \u2014 raising questions about potential national security implications. \n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice is under fire after reports that key FBI interview records tied to one of Donald Trump\u2019s accusers were deleted from the Epstein files. The contrast couldn\u2019t be sharper: while Trump and those in his administration continue to evade accountability in the U.S., King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are insisting that no one is above the law. Survivors\u2019 families call this long overdue. Could this finally mark the start of real consequences for the so-called \u201cEpstein class\u201d?\n\n\nFollow Jessica Tarlov, @JessicaTarlov. \nFollow Prof G, @profgalloway.\nFollow Raging Moderates, @RagingModeratesPod.\n\n#scottgalloway #politics #trump #jessicatarlov #aaronparnas #jeffepstein #epsteinfiles #epsteinclass #epstein #uk #kingcharles #princeandrew #royalfamily #mountbatten #nationalsecurity #keirstarmer #donaldtrump #howardlutnick #pambondi #deptofjustice #doj #virginiagiuffre #ghislainemaxwell\n \nPlease support this channel by subscribing here: www.youtube.com/@RagingModerates", "transcript_html": "<p><em>No transcript available for this video.</em></p>", "cleanup_applied": false, "cleanup_reason": "no_transcript"}
