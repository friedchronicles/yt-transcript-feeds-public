I can't even tell you how much has changed in the last few years. They changed the mandate of the NRC and they said you are no\nlonger focused just on safety. Department of Energy pathways\nhave been also unopened and unblocked for test reactors. The last 10 years or so, it's been like 1% of\nnuclear fuel used in the US was actually domestically mined. We're still buying like\nalmost 50% of our uranium from Russia and kind of ex-Soviet states. How capital intensive is it going to be to get your product to market?</p>\n<p>Oh, in the hundreds of millions. The biggest organization that showed up against Diablo Canyon was\ncalled \"Mothers for Peace.\" This organization was that old that it was related to the\nNuclear Cold War, right? I'm part of this \"Mothers\nfor Nuclear\" organization. Mothers against their mothers? Yeah. And then I brought some graphite. Do you want to take that out and I'll show it?\nSure, yeah. This is what we are\nusing for our moderator in our reactor. It has been designated a critical mineral. It's an important one. But this is just graphite. Like this is not, you know,</p>\n<p>uranium-235 or something. No, I wouldn't have brought you that. That would've been a little\nbit dangerous to be holding. Julia DeWahl is the co-founder of Antares, which is designing nuclear micro-reactors for the military and\nother off-grid use cases. Cheers.\nCheers. Thanks for coming by.\nIt's great to be here. So you started out first at\nOpendoor and then SpaceX. What did you learn in each one of those that you took to Antares? Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>I think one of the big things\nis always about customers, right? I mean, at the end of the day, this is why you build a business. At Opendoor, a lot of us were pretty young starting the business. I was one of the early employees there and none of us had ever bought, let alone sold a house. So a lot of it was like learning\nwhat that was all about. And I remember in the early days, we just were working on writing\nthe copy for the website and we're like\u2014 You have no idea what a homeowner\u2014 \"We don't really know much\nabout this whole thing. So what can we do about that?\" We just went and sat outside a bagel shop for a Saturday and a Sunday morning and just bought people bagels and just asked them about their processes</p>\n<p>buying and selling a\nhome and learned a ton. And just really thought about what\nlanguage they were using, what were the pain points, and that was really important to just like really get to know what we were trying to\ndeliver on as a business. And then, you know, fast forward to joining\nSpaceX after Opendoor. I joined as Starlink was coming out of R&D and into go-to-market. That's why I was joining.\nTo lead that team and the business operations there. And we launch and we\nget our first customers. And so I invited our first customers to come join us via Zoom for an all-hands.</p>\n<p>And it was honestly the first time that many of the engineers\nhad actually heard from the words of a customer themselves about the experience. And, of course, everyone\nloved the internet, right? The fast internet, it was amazing. Rural Idaho, right? This is like a dream. But when we got to talking\nabout the setup process, everyone kind of was like,\n\"Oh, that sounds rough.\" They're talking about\nmultiple Home Depot trips. They didn't know if they\nhad to cut down trees on their property. Like they couldn't get a pole long enough.</p>\n<p><strong>[03:00]</strong></p>\n<p>Ah, so a lot of it was\nsimplifying people's understanding of what would it mean? Well, people kind of didn't realize how much the setup was so painful. And it led to basically this\ncross-functional SWAT team that was dedicated to mounting options to be sold alongside the dish. First-party or third-party? We did it ourselves actually. We said it's important that\nwe have a good experience for that because actually it is a big part of the experience. And so, spun up a whole team. A lot of attention was given to mounting, which is like, who ever would've thought? And I think, you know, customers again,</p>\n<p>they're just like, they are the reason you start a business. And just bringing this back to Antares, I mean, the reason we started Antares was to say like the government,\nparticularly the military, needs more energy resilience, especially for critical infrastructure. We just do so much more now\nin the cloud with satellites. Our missile defense\nsites are sitting there like being powered by\ndiesel generators still. Like, shouldn't we upgrade that? Okay, so I'll buy it. What is Antares? Sure, sure. We're building micro-reactors,\nso small nuclear reactors, and we are building, in particular,</p>\n<p>for critical infrastructure,\nlargely for the military. Although we do think\nthat as costs come down, there will be an interesting\ncommercial market too. But basically anywhere where\nyou're off-grid for sure, or you just want\nresilience behind the grid as it exists today. Cyber attacks or whatever,\nthe grid goes down, you want backup power. It's a really great option. Okay. And if one megawatt is\na small neighborhood, if one gigawatt is like\na big nuclear power plant like in The Simpsons, you know? What are your SMRs?</p>\n<p>Sure, yeah. There's basically three classes size-wise. You have the really small\nones are the micro-reactors, and we're actually one\nof the smallest of those. So we're even sub-one-megawatt, we're kind of in the\nhundreds of kilowatt scale. You could think of that as like hundreds of houses\nworth of electricity. Then you have the SMRs, which is kind of this\nmiddle-ground bucket, which is an interesting kind\nof neither here nor there. But potentially interesting. I'm sure we'll get into, in the hundreds of megawatts or even 50 megawatts. And then you have the gigawatt scale. So a thousand megawatts, and that's what the current\npower plants are today. Okay, so you're sub a megawatt.</p>\n<p>So we're super small.\nI see. Okay. So you're kind of similar nuclear size to what will be on a submarine\nor something like that. Smaller than that even. Those are like megawatt scale. So we're like, think about like we're\nthe size of a car reactor. Think about replacing a diesel generator that's used to power, again, something that would be on the order of 200 to 300 homes of electricity. So it's quite small.\nYes. And so a big part of your\nfocus is providing power in places where you really\nneed that reliability. Like you're talking about\nreplacing diesel generators. Is that kind of the design center for you? Yeah.</p>\n<p>Anywhere where you're going\nto enable a capability, a mission capability, that wouldn't really\nbe possible otherwise. So there's actually\nsome really interesting space applications, potentially underwater\napplications as you move to... So you move away from like few, what they call exquisite\nto attritable systems. This is where a really small\nreactor can come in very handy for, you know, the submarines are obviously\nmulti-megawatt-powered systems,</p>\n<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>\n<p>but these could be kilowatts-powered, smaller systems underwater. But yes, anywhere where you're off-grid, where today you're\nrelying on what they call like the fuel supply chain of like bringing in fuel via helicopter or barge repeatedly. And that being a vulnerability, like this is a great option. So you're the Starlink of electricity. Kind of. We're actually like perfectly paired. And I wish we could\noffer a consumer product. That's not on our roadmap right now, but maybe one day, like, backpack-sized nuclear reactor. I presume it can't be on your roadmap, but why not?</p>\n<p>Is it that selling to the\ngovernment is much easier than selling to something that\u2014 There's so many reasons. I think that you always want\nto try to get your beachhead where it's the easiest to achieve, right? And so we believe, I believe that premium power is where you\nneed to go with nuclear. And there's sort of two places for that. One is what we're doing with Antares, which is go to the military, help them with mission-critical need where they're not cost-sensitive, where they already pay more for power. And go there and support them with this next-gen, better\nversion of resilient power. Or you go and you sell what\nwe're seeing now, I think,</p>\n<p>which is really interesting\nwith the hyperscalers, is they have carbon commitments. They want clean, firm,\nthey want 24/7 power. They're actually willing to\npay above market rates for that and they will pay above market rates. So this premium power thing is a really interesting dynamic like where nuclear is\nkind of well-positioned. What are the underwater applications? Well, it's really just\nthink mini submarines. Oh, okay, yeah. Just really small systems like, you know, what drones are to maybe\nlike larger missiles. That's kind of the equivalent. It's not super far along just yet. Got it. Okay.</p>\n<p>What does the path look like between now and producing power for the military? I guess, first in a pilot environment and then at scale outside of a pilot environment. Yeah, well, you know, it's always what are the next\nmilestones that you can do to prove your technical ability and again, raise more capital to keep\ngoing with your company? I think the biggest risk\noften to hardware companies is you don't get far\nenough along technically to merit additional investment. So we are thinking a\nlot about our milestones</p>\n<p>for reactor development. And so next year our criticality test is kind of the first milestone. By end of 2027, we want to have our first demonstration unit demonstrated. And what's really exciting is there's just so much good\npolicy happening right now from the DOE and elsewhere that is supporting reactor\ntests and pilot programs. And so there's just like so much happening where they're opening up federal land. They're removing\u2014 starting to remove some of\nthose like NEPA-type regulations that really just hold everything up.</p>\n<p>So there is a clearer path now than there really ever has\nbeen for reactor builds. Oh, we'll get to the regulatory side. I have a lot of questions, but what is your criticality test in 2026? What does that mean? Yeah, it means that you're testing that you can actually start your reaction. So like you've figured out</p>\n<p><strong>[09:02]</strong></p>\n<p>the right amount of moderator-to-fuel. And you start it going critical. You don't have it continue on for a while. You don't typically have\na power conversion system that's actually taking the raw energy and turning it into electricity. So it's just one of those initial tests, like can you start to put\nall your pieces together? And when do you, you know, the fusion guys are all focused on this. Producing more power than you put in. I know that's different. That's a fusion thing, but when do you actually produce power?</p>\n<p>Producing power will be like\nyour first reactor test. It's like, can you do the whole shebang? Like you can get this\nthing up and running. It's producing power. And that's what we're aiming\nto do by the end of 2027. Oh wow, that's like pretty soon. Yeah. What does the market look\nlike for these small reactors? Who are you going to compete with? Well, the market for micro-reactors is one of these ones\nwhere it's like, well, there are no micro-reactors\ntoday on the market to just like buy and use. So what do you think\nthey're going to be, right? And so I think, first and foremost, it's going to be the most critical assets where you just cannot have them go down.</p>\n<p>Which is why defense is the\nperfect first market for it. And so it's going to be all of\nyour critical infrastructure on every single base that there is. Obviously, you'll start\nwith the most critical of critical missile defense\nsites and off-grid locations, things like that. And that's kind of defense. Then you think about commercial, basically you have to see where\nthe cost curves gets you to. Like how cheap can it get? This is just like space, right? It's like those first\nexpensive launches into space like that better have been\na really important thing you're putting up there, right? But now that launch cost has come down,</p>\n<p>you can start to be like, \"Oh, what else? What else could we do that\nwe can do some more stuff that's like maybe not\nso mission-critical?\" I think we'll see the same thing in the commercial industries. Oil and gas has a lot of areas where they, again, use diesel generators to do things like compressed natural gas along their pipelines and they actually have carbon commitments, which are really interesting that they're sort of thinking about. Ironically, right? Can they move towards some more renewable or nuclear type resources? So I think there's going to be</p>\n<p>some commercial applications there too. Mining, for example, too. Like anything that's just like off-grid, hard to power today, really hard to get fuel into. It's perfect market.\nYes. You're probably following the US military, there's all these controversies right now with people talking about fuel quality and fuel contamination issues in Asia, I think it is. But yeah. Presumably places where you're worried about fuel availability at all times and ensuring that you\nconstantly have access to fuel. That is the place where\nthere will be the most pull for these solutions. Like that's where generators work worst.</p>\n<p>Yes, and you know, there's\na famous defense quote, I think it's \"unleash us\nfrom the tether of fuel,\" which means just like, gosh, the logistics supply\nchain has been such a challenge. I mean it was 50% of the\u2014 I think the Afghanistan casualties\nwere from just logistics. And so, you know, having situations where you can kind of reduce that risk helps and it's a great market fit.</p>\n<p><strong>[12:02]</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. You were saying there's no market for these small reactors today. Why not? Like\u2014 We've had nuclear fission technology for a long time. Yeah. Why hasn't it been done? Gosh, there's so many reasons. I think we ended up... I think there was just a\nmacro really negative climate around nuclear in general. So it impacted anything small as well, coming out of the seventies, and so you had macro forces\nrelated to just like inflation, kind of just cost of capital. People stopped building, which coincided with the\nenvironmental movement, which was extremely anti-nuclear.</p>\n<p>They actually sort of conflated\nnuclear weapons testing even with\u2014it was just like\n\"no nukes\" with energy. It's like, \"Oh that's\nactually pretty different.\" So a lot of things\nconverged in the seventies and then by the eighties we\nstopped building in nuclear. Okay. So you just view it as\na part of the general anti-nuclear swing and thus also led to the cessation of construction of new nuclear plants in the\nUS and everything like this. Your corner of the market\nalso got caught up in that. And that's why we haven't\nended up with them. Were there ever products\navailable at this size range?</p>\n<p>There were but they were\npretty few and far between. Mostly test reactors, small things built. We actually put one reactor\ninto space in the 1960s to test that out. Did it work? Yeah, for a bit. I mean, a few months and was like, let's try to do some systems in space with power. It's important to have power in space and I think that's a whole other frontier. Obviously the US did\nhave this long-running, anti-nuclear bent where I\ngrew up in Ireland similarly. Yeah, there was the exact same thing</p>\n<p>and Ireland was very paranoid about a particular British\nnuclear power plant, Sellafield, that was just across the\nchannel from Ireland. Does Ireland have nuclear? Ireland has no nuclear power. The UK does. France does. Ireland does not. And I believe it's banned and so you can't, per the current rules. There's actually many states in the US that have bans as well, but they've just been\nfalling left and right. It's so cool to see. Well I was going to ask this. The vibe has really shifted\nover the past 10 to 15 years. Yep.</p>\n<p>Why? Honestly, it reminds me of gay marriage. I mean, and if you look at the polling. It came from the youth, right? It definitely comes from youth for sure. But it's like, it just...\nEnough things add up and it just swings and no one\never looks back type of thing. That's how it feels. The percentage point change we've seen in the last five to 10\nyears is almost 20 points. It's like 17 points or something. So it's 60-plus percent\nof people support nuclear. It's actually almost surprising\nit's that low in some ways. But yeah, it's just huge\npublic sentiment shift. And I think the old hippie nuclear testing</p>\n<p>or nuclear weapons testing\nfolks are kind of dying out. What is wild though is I did\na little kind of activism related to Diablo Canyon Power\nPlant here in California, which was slated to be\nshut down this year. Sure, yeah. And just a few years ago, Newsom had to kind of\nbegrudgingly say like, \"Oh, you know what, we probably should keep this thing on. We can't afford to have\nthe power going out.\"</p>\n<p><strong>[15:04]</strong></p>\n<p>But I listened in on some hearings and actually gave some testimony there. And it was so funny to me that the biggest\norganization that showed up against Diablo Canyon was\ncalled \"Mothers for Peace.\" And it's like, do you understand\nthe irony of your name? This organization was that old that it was related to\nlike the nuclear Cold War. Right?\nTotally. And it's like, gosh, we've moved on. We were joking because I, sort of, am part of this \"Mothers for Nuclear\" organization that's like tongue in cheek a bit on that. Our mothers against their mothers. Yeah, our mothers against their mothers. And it's just funny how old school a lot of that opposition is.</p>\n<p>So I guess as a \"science\nadvances one death at a time\" dynamic going on here, whereas\nthe memory of the 1960s and peak nuclear confrontation and, you know, Three Mile\nIsland and all these things. As all that fades, maybe it creates an environment where people could be more\nsupportive of nuclear. Yeah, absolutely.\nYeah. What was your activism\naround Diablo Canyon? It was just exactly that. It was like, let's make sure\nthat this actually passes and we don't shut it down. But it's safe. But there was a lot of people\njust calling and saying, \"Hey listen, nuclear's super\nsafe, it's carbon-free.</p>\n<p>Ostensibly, in California,\nwe care about these things. Let's support this. Let's overturn whatever\nlegislation was done 10 years ago that said we\nshould shut this thing down.\" And it did pass. So now we do still have it open. Everyone on \"Progress\nTwitter\" likes to complain about the NRC, but for the NRC we would be living in that Jetsons vision of the future and everyone would have their nuclear-powered car\nthat they used to drive to their nuclear-powered\noffice and everything. Is that true? How good or bad is the current\nregulatory environment?</p>\n<p>How much is that changing? Yeah, yeah. I think it's an overestimated\nheadwind. Certainly today. I think if you go back five years ago, 10 years ago for sure, I mean they hadn't licensed\nanything in decades. There had been nothing new. But I can't even tell\nyou how much has changed in the last few years. It's kind of remarkable. And it's been across both the Biden and the Trump administration, which is amazing to see. The legislation around nuclear passes like 95 to 5 type of thing, right? It's like really, really\nstrong bipartisan...</p>\n<p>What was interesting to see\nis it started with Biden, a bunch of legislation\nrelated to modernizing and reforming the NRC. The biggest thing they did\nwas they changed the mandate of the NRC and they said, \"You are no longer\nfocused just on safety,\" because what's the safest number of nuclear reactors to license? Zero, so they expanded that, \"You must consider the full environment, the full civilization.\" That's great. And then just change things around like the advanced reactor pathway, removing some of the barriers.</p>\n<p>And then it's continued on with Trump and in fact he's sort of added even some more teeth and specificity. So right now, they've changed it to, \"You have 18 months to get\nyour answer from the NRC. License or no license.\" Like do you pass or not? And what happens if they\nexceed the 18-month window? You know, probably it's\nin the details somewhere. But the point is that\nthese have been declared</p>\n<p><strong>[18:05]</strong></p>\n<p>that timeliness is important. There's also been some leadership change, which is just more\nreform-oriented, which is great, and there's just a huge microscope on it. Everyone's watching. Everyone knows who's\nsubmitting their paperwork and what's going to\ncome out the other side. Another thing that happened\nwith some of these Trump executive orders is the DOE pathways, Department of Energy pathways, have been also unopened and\nunblocked for test reactors. And so actually Antares is part of this new test reactor\nprogram which allows the DOE alongside usually like Idaho National Lab to be sort of your regulator</p>\n<p>as you're testing your first reactors so that you don't have to\nspend all this time upfront with the NRC for something that you're just still\ninnovating on and iterating on. And so that's a really nice, I think, first step before you go through the NRC. Wait, so let me make sure\nI'm giving this right. There is now a Trump-era change where we essentially\nfor the first time ever have a second nuclear regulator where you can go the NRC path but also there's a regulatory\nsandbox where you can start by working with the DOE and\nget up and running there. Yeah, that's essentially right.</p>\n<p>How big is the sandbox? I mean, the DOE has always been a path. There actually technically\nhas always been a path within the military because they license their\nown reactors with submarines. So it's always kind of been there but hard to navigate, not\nwell-staffed, not well-known about. And now it's like everyone's watching. Let's go DOE, let's go INL, Idaho National Lab, and let's\nmake these things happen. So there's just been a lot of stated like, \"You must enable this thing.\" And like, now here's some... It's actually a $0 program, but it gives you unlimited access to staff</p>\n<p>and all these other things. And the point is like everyone's watching to see how fast you can get one of these reactors through safely. So are you guys going\nthe DOE routes first? Yep, we are. And the DOD route, I mean to say like, the Army is now also able\nto license its own reactors, alongside the Navy which already does. So that will absolutely be our first stop. The NRC really only regulates\ncivilian electricity. So civilian power. So we actually don't need\nto even go there yet. I see.</p>\n<p>So you could be selling a lot of reactors and never go through the NRC. We'll basically do our\ntest reactors with the DOE. Alongside the DOD who can now\u2014 who has the jurisdiction to regulate. Which is great.\nI didn't know that. So this is the rare bipartisan issue. It's a true... Kind of a gem. I can paint three clean energy futures. One is the solar and\nregular renewables view. You know, Casey Handmer\nwas just on this podcast. And solar will get very cheap.</p>\n<p>Batteries will get cheap enough such that you can go all\nin on solar and batteries. Maybe some other renewables in the mix. But there you go. That's it. Nothing will be able to\ncost-compete with that. That's one vision. Another is that we will\nrediscover nuclear fission and we'll figure out the spent fuel and everything like that. And we'll just do what we used to do,</p>\n<p><strong>[21:07]</strong></p>\n<p>which is build nuclear power\nplants at larger scale. And that delivers us enough clean energy. A third view is that fusion will work and we'll actually have nuclear fusion at useful, meaningful scale of the grid. Between those scenarios, how would you handicap them? I think it's... You know,\nI'm going to leave fusion out because I'm not enough of an expert to know when and how that will happen. I would love for that to happen. How exciting, right? Between the first two, we do a lot of market\nmanipulation of our energy markets and there's a little bit of like,</p>\n<p>flavor of the administration\nthat does happen, especially between renewables\nand oil and gas, right? Nuclear's been a little bit actually immune to that. But there hasn't really\nbeen almost a true market for this stuff. Like the renewables have\nbeen heavily subsidized for a while and nuclear has not been. That did change in 2022 with the IRA. There's now production\ntax credits for nuclear, which has a lot of ripple effects. But I think we're going\nto see a lot more progress with solar and batteries in particular. There is a reason, however,\nthat the hyperscalers who are committed to their climate targets</p>\n<p>are not just going for,\nyou know, solar farms. Like why are even thinking about nuclear if solar is so cheap? And it's because actually to get true hundred\npercent, 24/7 coverage, the battery or the excess\nbuild-out is massive. It is really expensive. It's basically on par with nuclear costs. So we're not there yet. It's one thing to say. The other is that the cost of solar at the panel level is dirt cheap, right? And installing it dirt cheap, but to actually integrate\nit, build the transmission,</p>\n<p>and then the added grid complexity where you need now these\npeaker gas plants to run when the the clouds come and that kind of thing. That actually has a ton of costs and it's sort of hidden costs. I think it's underappreciated certainly by the solar maxis out there. It's real, you know, and so I think we're always\ngoing to want to have multiple sources of energy, right? It's like diversity is good. It's like if one thing\u2014 if natural gas prices are\nthrough the roof, hey, we have these other things. We have this base load nuclear,</p>\n<p>which has been just like so stable for us. And I think we're going to\nwant to have everything. I actually don't think\nthere's going to be a world that's going to be like a\nhundred percent nuclear. But is diversity of energy\nsources valuable because the solar maximalist\nwould say, \"No, it's fine. Solar will just take everything.\" And wouldn't the nuclear maximalist say just we can have a lot of, you know, we figure out how to at scale\nproduce nuclear power plants and why do you need nat gas? Why do you need anything else? It's a good push if you are able to own, through and through,\nyour whole supply chain.</p>\n<p>You make the panels. You mine and process the minerals, which we have like zero\ninterest in doing as Americans. All that dirty work is done\nin China and elsewhere. If you really did all that yourself, then I could say, okay,\nyou own it. You can do it. Right now at least you have, \"Hey, if your natural gas\npipelines get shut down, actually it's not a problem for us. We're not even an importer anymore. We're actually good.\"</p>\n<p><strong>[24:07]</strong></p>\n<p>This is actually the reason that... Do you know what percentage\nof France's electricity is from nuclear? It's declining, right? But historically it's been around 70%. Yep.\nYeah. Do you know the US? The US for nuclear? Oh, it's small. It's 5-10%. It's actually more. Really?\n18. Oh, okay. And everyone thinks it's below 5-10%. It's like, when I got into this, I thought it was like 2%. But anyway, my point is\nthat France made a very, very deliberate decision\nto actually go to 70%, if not more at the time in the seventies because they had no carbon resources.</p>\n<p>So they didn't have the ability to say, \"Oh, we'll just dig in our\nbackyard and we'll be fine.\" And actually uranium,\nwhile it does require digging out of ground or whatever, is so much easier to store. It's a million times as dense as coal. So it's a lot easier to work with than... The reason people get uptight\nabout oil and gas supply is that it's like not easy to store. And if it's not easier for you to come by, you better well have good\ngeopolitical relationships. Yes, yes.\nSo anyway, this world and where it's headed, I think it's still going to\ninvolve multiple sources. Julia's work involves\nmanaging a lot of risk:</p>\n<p>unsolved physics, complex engineering, and a lot of regulatory scrutiny. Managing risk for an internet retailer shouldn't be that complex, but sometimes it can feel like it. Internet fraudsters now\noperate on industrial scales. They attack strategically\nwhen you're sleeping and they use AI to\nsharpen their attacks now. Stripe's defense against\nfraud comes from its scale. When a payment happens on your site, there's a 92% chance we've\nseen that exact card before. So it's easier for us to spot misuse. And we recently expanded Radar to block other kinds of fraud, like free trial abuse, promotion\nabuse and refund abuse. Stripe now processes trillions\nof dollars of payments</p>\n<p>each year and every transaction\nin the Stripe network makes the next one safer for everyone. So you can focus on your product and not on developing a\nworld-class counter-fraud division. To let Radar handle the fraud so you can get back to\nbuilding your product, go to stripe.com/radar. Tell me about the supply\nchain for nuclear fuels. Yeah, I mean, you dig uranium out of the ground and then you need to convert\nit to a gaseous state so that you can enrich it and have the... you kind of put in a centrifuge. It goes like this and the\nheavier isotopes go out</p>\n<p>and the lighter ones stay in and you can pick those out\nand make those into your fuel. The mining part has been something that we've hardly kept alive. I mean there was, at one point, a couple of mining\noperations going in the US. The last 10 years or so, it's been like 1% of\nnuclear fuel used in the US was actually domestically mined. Where are the last\nuranium mines in the US? They're places where you would think: Texas, Wyoming, those sorts of places. In the western states. But we now again, like\neverything else have said,</p>\n<p>\"Okay, wake up, let's actually\nreshore some of this stuff.\" So we're starting to\nsee more uranium mining. Conversion and enrichment is\nstill largely done overseas. And yeah, we're still buying\nlike almost 50% of our uranium from Russia and kind of ex-Soviet states.</p>\n<p><strong>[27:10]</strong></p>\n<p>So I think it is important\nthat we're thinking about like, how do we have far more of\na domestic supply chain? We have the ability to do it. We have the uranium and actually there's a little bit of Silicon Valley DNA entering the space with General Matter, which is Scott Nolan's\ncompany out of Founders Fund. So he's getting into the enrichment space. They're a uranium enrichment company. They're a uranium enrichment company, which is like real picks\nand shovels for a real hard atoms business to do that. But I think it's really meaningful work. I think it's really important.</p>\n<p>Do you care more about the mining, the enrichment happening in the US, or just there has to be an independent supply\nchain for the whole thing? I think you just want diversity. You know, you don't want\neverything from one place. And I think we do want to have capability. So I think all of it should be\nat least partially done here and with our allies. How did you end up starting Antares? Gosh, I mean... Like most people do not\nhappen on this kind of idea. No, you kind of don't\nreally happen upon it. I was working at SpaceX at the time when I first started\nreading about nuclear. And it was when I was actually working on getting Starlinks into Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So after Russia invaded Ukraine. And I just started like reading more about the conflict there, probably more than I normally would have, because I was actually\nspeaking with Ukrainians and like thinking about\nwhat was going on there. I was a history major. So I think there was just\na little bit of like, \"Oh, geopolitics.\nResources are important.\" Russia has a lot of resources. You know, randomly, my cousin\nis the CEO of a glass factory, making literally glasses like this. And he is like, \"We're going bankrupt\nbecause of energy prices.\" And you're like, \"Golly,\nwhat is going on?\" And then I read about Germany</p>\n<p>and the nuclear power plants\nthey were shutting off to turn on coal in a place that is like\u2014 It was so insane.\nGreen Party. Crazy, right?\nLost their minds. So I was like, \"What\ncould be so compelling that someone would do something so counter to their own good,\" right? As a country, as a nation. And I, at the time, again, I\nknew nothing about nuclear. I didn't know the difference\nbetween fission and fusion, honestly, at the time. I certainly didn't know that it was a pretty big part\nof our grid and other things. But it just was one of those like completely under-celebrated, under-championed by anyone. The climate tech...</p>\n<p>Climate people really\nweren't into it either. And so it just kind of\ngot me curious about it and then just started reading more. Wrote a piece that I posted on Twitter and it's actually how I met\nJordan, who's my co-founder, and he's the one who\nactually had the vision for micro-reactors for the military. And I just said, \"What a\ngreat beachhead\". Like again, premium power, great thesis\nto go to market with, and just really got into the topic. How did you arrive at that as a beachhead? I think, you know, you just say like, where can you go that\nyou don't have to compete on that LCOE level against\nthe cheap solar panels.</p>\n<p>Where do you go where there's a real need? And mission assurance for something critical to the military. Like, they will pay for that. This is also an area where like they were obviously behind\nthe Manhattan Project. They're here to help\ndevelop new technologies. And so what a great partner to have when trying to do something like this. Has DARPA played with this stuff at all?</p>\n<p><strong>[30:11]</strong></p>\n<p>Or has it come from... It\nsounds like you're working with the main branches of the military. Yeah, you know, we are\nnot working with DARPA mostly because it's actually\nnot as technically risky as you might even think. They prefer things\nfurther at the risk curve. Exactly. We actually... In a funny way, it's not even really a tech problem. You know, I mean it's hard\nto build these things, but it's not brand new. But someone just needs to know how to\u2014 It's not novel in that way. That's interesting. What lessons have you brought from your prior experience\nat SpaceX, at Opendoor to building Antares? You know, one of the things I\nreally took away from SpaceX</p>\n<p>was just like really getting into it. It's a very confrontational culture and it's not afraid to say\nlike, \"Screw your next meeting. We need to keep talking about this.\" And I love that. Like, I want to bring that\nenergy everywhere I go. It's like, if you are\nunsure about something, if you're questioning something, you should probably stop and dig into it. We had this thing called the \"Five Whys,\" I don't know if you ever use\u2014 In general, yeah.\nIt's like a...</p>\n<p>one of these Silicon Valley little quips. But it's like that on steroids. And I think the pausing\nto probe super deeply, question things, like\nreally hash things out was a big takeaway I learned. Like, wow, that's really effective at getting to the right answer, at making a decision, at changing course when you need to. And so I've tried to bring\nsome of that to Antares. You know, investors are\nhot and cold on hard tech depending on when you're raising money</p>\n<p>and everything like this. Presumably there's a J-curve in investing in Antares where there's definitely some R&D before you eventually start\npaying it back with revenues. How is the experience of\nraising money for this? It's going to get harder. I think it hasn't been hard to date only because there is interest and excitement around nuclear. It's also just fewer\ndollars in the beginning. You're kind of like honeymoon\nphase of all of that. I think it will get harder.</p>\n<p>I think now the time\nis ticking. It's like, \"Okay, let's see your next\ntechnical milestones.\" This criticality test, obviously the full reactor end of 2027. I think it will be challenging. And there are several\nreactor companies out there, so it's a bit of a race. I think it's going to be fun. I mean, I wonder what\nPolymarket would have to say. Several reactor companies out there, even at the end of the market\nthat you guys are going after? Yeah, everyone has their\ndifferent niche, right? I think our niche is again, the smallest, the most DOD-oriented.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of micro-reactor\ncompanies or SMR. And I'm doing this because it's like, \"Are they SMR, micro-reactors?\" Anyway, that are going after data centers and the data center build-out,\nwhich is an amazing market. I mean, amazing. I think people will pay a lot more, again, going back to the premium power point, they will pay more for power for this. Not exactly our target market. Right, so your niche in the market, it seems like you guys have\nselected a part of the market</p>\n<p><strong>[33:13]</strong></p>\n<p>where maybe there's less competition. There's still some people going after the military applications. There always are. I mean, if you have a good idea, there's going to be a\nfew people working on it. How capital-intensive is it going to be to get your product to market? In the hundreds of millions. Okay.\nYep. I think what we... And it depends on what you\nmean by \"to market,\" right? So I think our big milestones, like can you build a reactor, prove it, turn it on, it's producing power. Then I think you can think\nabout interesting layers of capital in terms of\npre-orders for your reactor. That's going to be my next question. When does the money arrive?</p>\n<p>Yeah, exactly. Bigger government grants. So we're kind of still in\nthe hundreds of thousands, single-digit millions of dollars of grants that we are getting right now. But you're moving into\nthe tens of millions of dollars R&D grants. And then you want to\neventually move into that program-of-record, real dollars. There's a really interesting\nprogram right now that the Army has put out\ncalled the Janus program. Are you familiar with the\nCOTS program that SpaceX used to bring, to develop their first reactor? Not by name, but I'm familiar with\u2014 Commercial Orbital Transport System. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm\nfamiliar with the broad\u2014</p>\n<p>So it was the innovation basically to say like, let's try\nsomething that's not cost-plus and let's actually do something\nthat's milestone-based and you know, \"Well,\nbasically we'll cut you if you don't hit the milestone\nand it's fixed contract. We're not going to pay you for whatever.\" So anyway, the Army has\ntaken that model a bit and I think used that as\ninspiration for this Janus program where they're saying,\n\"We're going to fund up to three to five companies to\nbuild their first prototype alongside us, kind of at a base. And then we will choose a winner and we want to build 5 to 10 reactors,</p>\n<p>if not more on bases.\" And so the demand signal now is hot. And so this is going to be great\nfor our future fundraising, for the industry in general. It's like very, very good demand. A lot of incumbents build on military, US defense contracting. What is your experience as someone who's attempting to sell to the military? I mean, people are\nactually kind of well aware that this cost-plus model is not great. The question is like, well,\nwhat are the alternatives? Who's going to go do it?</p>\n<p>Anduril has been an\namazing example of that. So I think a lot of us in hard\ntech really look to them as what we try to emulate. Every branch of the military has these innovative\narms that tell you like, \"Hey, we want to hear about your ideas.\" And they do actually,\nyou can go talk to them. They're giving out\ngrants for things like... I do think everyone wants the innovation. They are, you know, and in this day and age\nof information everywhere, you can learn a lot quickly. They do want to work with startups. I think we'll only see more of it, but you have things like\nthe government shutdown</p>\n<p>and the pace of government is slow. So you've got to just be able to keep pushing those timelines, again, while not running out of money, to be able to make it through that valley of death. What's been harder than you\nexpected building Antares? Because presumably you\nexpected it broadly to be hard. You expected there to be\na lot of technical risk. Capital intensity.\nYeah, harder than expected.</p>\n<p><strong>[36:14]</strong></p>\n<p>Oh. There's a couple things. I mean, I think, gosh... Recruiting is always hard. You're up against the SpaceXs of the world that have just a lot\nmore credibility, right? When you're the no-name\nperson at the very beginning, it can be hard. I think there's a lot of complexity, and even though I said we're making so much\nprogress in regulation, there's still red tape everywhere. Things cost more than\nthey probably should. You know, we spend a lot of\nmoney paying the national labs to do things like clear out a pit</p>\n<p>so that we can test our reactor. And it's like, we're paying for that. And they're like, \"You know, here's hundreds of thousand\ndollars. Here's the bill.\" So there's stuff that you're like, \"Gosh, there's really a lot of expense everywhere and it just slows things down.\" And so I guess we were\nsomewhat ready for that. But some of this stuff just seems silly and when you're building in software, you just don't have to worry about it. You just sit there,\ncode, and do your thing and go right to market. When you have to work with\nthe real world, you have to, you know, you have to play\ntheir games a little bit and you have to follow\nthe process in some ways.</p>\n<p>And there's not always a way around it. Sometimes it's just through. You said there's still a lot of red tape despite the fact that there's been the first Biden-era and then Trump-era improvements. If you were in charge,\nI know energies are... Or you know, we'll give you a role with no powers across\nall these departments. What would you change? What do you think the\nspecific improvements we could make are? If I were fully in charge of energy, I would love to see the\nUS government be a buyer. I think that is... Just like\nactually the NASA was a buyer</p>\n<p>for SpaceX's eventual launch product. I think having the US\ngovernment be a customer for nuclear would be great. And so we have this a\nlittle bit with the DOD. It was a very interesting announcement that just came out a week or two ago that doesn't have a ton of detail, but it's starting in this direction. I think it's very positive. I'm a small government person,\nso I don't say this lightly, but I do think there are certain things when it's national security related and things like energy resilience. There should be\npublic-private partnership.</p>\n<p>But anyway, the announcement\nis that the US government now wants to spend $80 billion on nuclear development\nalongside Westinghouse. So they've basically\nchosen the technology. And I think that's actually a good thing because you don't want to... You want to be able to build one thing and then repeatedly build it so that you're not reinventing\nthe wheel every time. You actually have economies of scale, like the learning curve that\nyou go down from doing that. So I'm excited about that news. I think that's the type of\npolicy I'd want to see more of. And, you know, we'll see how it goes.</p>\n<p>I mean, this is the biggest\never commercial nuclear public-private partnership we've seen. And sorry, specifically they're\nbuying from Westinghouse. Just a large amount of nuclear power? Well, it's a combination. So this is where, I mean, the details are a little fuzzy but they've announced 80 billion. They've announced Westinghouse\nas the partner of choice.</p>\n<p><strong>[39:15]</strong></p>\n<p>Not all those dollars are going right to Westinghouse. And that's a company that\nmakes just the reactor itself. So there's money that you\nwould spend on a plant or licensing fees or whatever\nelse that surrounds that. But I think it's really positive. I think what it does is it's a catalyst for the whole industry, right? Like supply chain, workforce. People are now paying attention like, \"Oh, there's real\ndollars to be made here.\" There's a huge trillion-dollar\nasset under management company called Brookfield\nAsset Management. And they've actually just\ngotten in the game as well in the last couple weeks.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there was talk, right? To take the V.C. Summer plant that never got completed in South Carolina and actually finish it. And so again, they now\nhave some nice tailwinds with those new production subsidies. They are partnering with\nthe local utility to... And again, a local utility\ndoesn't have the risk appetite to do this themselves, right? Or the balance sheet\nto do this themselves. And so there's some really nice market signal you get when the government's saying, \"We're going to spend\n$80 billion on this.\" But I think</p>\n<p>it gets the rest of the industry moving. As you guys were exploring and\ndeveloping the early stages of your business plan, did you consider for a product\nthat is as tightly regulated as this, did you consider\ndoing any jurisdiction shopping where you develop a product\nthat you sell in Singapore or the UAE or Prospera or some more favorable jurisdiction? You know, we really didn't. It felt like there was enough signal that we would be able to</p>\n<p>get through regulatory and\nsee some positive change. There was enough basically\ndemand signal within the US, and it's... I don't know, we take pride in also building\nfor our country, right? And it feels good to\nbe developing something for our military and our allies. So we didn't really\nshop it around too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I guess the US military is\na large buyer, in this case. Very large buyer. The largest buyer of non-commodity energy, if not all energy. How soon afterwards will you go to, like, I presume you want to do\ncivilian premium power use cases, like you're saying an oil rig</p>\n<p>seems like the one that, ironically that... It\nwould be hard to get gas, it would be hard to get refined diesel or gasoline to an oil rig. Does that come right afterwards or is that such a different ball of wax from a regulatory point of view that maybe it's like 10 years later? I think it's, you know, you're\ndeveloping concurrently. We are talking with oil and gas already. Just understanding them, right? \"What do you need? What do you think you'd\npay?\" That sort of thing. So I would say it fast follows, right? A few years later.</p>\n<p>I think it's going to be\nsuch a nice proving ground if we can make it through\nand test on a military base, for example, and get a first reactor live and get some revenue from that, then I think it's like open\nthe aperture pretty broadly for what else is out there. Does this movement towards\nre-onshoring manufacturing</p>\n<p><strong>[42:16]</strong></p>\n<p>in the US and various blockers\npeople talk about to that between supply chain\nis difficult in your... You've talked about in the fuel context, but also supply chain for manufacturing, talent and the roles that people go into and finding talent in specific areas. I'm just curious. What\nhas your experience been of building a hard tech company in the US? Supply chain is... Yeah, the bottlenecks. Supply\nchain is challenging when you need to work with\nnuclear-grade material and no nuclear plants\nhave really been built. It makes for a very limited\nnumber of suppliers.</p>\n<p>Which means costs are higher. You know, options are just fewer. So like, if they're not\nresponding to your email, well what are you going to do? You know, there's only one other option. And like, I don't know,\nthey're busy or whatever. So those dynamics are really challenging. The graphite that I\nbrought here is actually from a Japanese company, right? No one's even processing\nthat stuff in the US. And so you're kind of, you're literally going all over the world for these supplies. So that's challenging. You know, talent is\nchallenging in the sense that there are so many options for hard tech in the LA region, right? So you need to have a compelling mission,</p>\n<p>but nuclear is compelling. So it's been challenging,\nbut not in some ways. If you want to work at SpaceX\nand you love space stuff and you want to be at\nthat name brand place, we've lost you. But if you're interested in nuclear and being able to build\nfrom the very beginning, that is a compelling piece. Yes. It's the Shackleton\npitch, you know of\u2014 Yeah, totally. High risk of failure.\nTotally. And that's the pitch that you're making. Yep.\nYeah, I like that. What trends in nuclear should\nwe be excited about right now? So the trend I'm excited\nabout is bringing back online</p>\n<p>these recently shuttered plants because they don't take too\nmuch money to bring back online. And we've seen a couple big\npower purchase agreements where you have Google\npartnered with NextEra or the Iowa-based utility\nto bring on Dwayne Arnold, which was shut down about five years ago. And then you have actually\nThree Mile Island, the site of the infamous accident is also\u2014 Almost accident.\nWell, it was an accident but it was not really a big deal. Like this much radiation came out.</p>\n<p>It was like this amount of a chest x-ray. Yes, completely overblown \"accident\". That's being brought back online. Partnership between Microsoft\nand Constellation, I believe. So that's kind of fun. I mean, you're seeing like, let's go take these assets\nthat are just sitting there that shouldn't have been turned off. Bring them back online,\nbring them back to life. Tons of power coming out of them. And we need it yesterday, right? Yeah, I mean it's so striking the big trend in the US right now, being that grid demand was\nflat for the longest time. Like we were completely not\u2014\nExactly.</p>\n<p>Not adding power generation\nnor adding power transmission. And now because of data centers, essentially, we have this enormous boom that is just leading to things that maybe previously\nwould've been competitive. People can't get enough\nof anything, right? You know, people can't\nget enough of nuclear, they can't get enough of solar,</p>\n<p><strong>[45:16]</strong></p>\n<p>they can't get enough of natural gas. And just everything is backlogged. It's really interesting. Even the natural gas\nturbines are backlogged. Totally, yeah.\nI mean, multiple years. Across all the manufacturers. You know, it is hard when something like this goes into one of these inflection points, and to your point, it was less than 1% year-over-year growth for 20-plus years. And now it's like people are estimating 5% annual growth next year. Like, oh my gosh. Last question. What kind of culture do you\nwant to build at Antares? Hmm. Well, I think it's\ncertainly one of excellence, and I think that means</p>\n<p>delivering quality product. How you get there... I mean, there's a lot\nof ways to get there. You can have the combative SpaceX culture. You can have a less combative, maybe more, I don't know, writing culture. They don't write that\nmuch stuff down in SpaceX. To me that matters less. Although I tend to be one\nfor a working environment that is energized, positive preferably. But I think, ultimately, I would be proud to be delivering on an excellent product that can be delivered\nto market soon, right?</p>\n<p>And we can all go use. But, okay. So you want the kinda\nresults-oriented culture. Results speak for themselves\nin a lot of ways, yeah. Julia, thank you. Thanks. Thanks for having me.</p>"}
