Bryan and Adam were joined by frequent future-ologists Simon Willison, Steve Klabnik, and Ian Grunert to review past predictions and peer into the future. If any of these predictions come to fruition, it's going to be an interest 1, 3, or 6 years!\n\nNotes: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/blob/master/2026_01_05.md", "transcript_html": "<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>\n<p>Hello, Adam. >> Hello, Brian. How are you? >> I am doing well. How are you? >> I'm good. And the hype has been building here. Everyone has been dropping in. So, showing up four minutes late is like a totally pro move. I love it for the new year. >> Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I I was going to go full like Lauren Hill and not like take the stage until 10 p.m., you know, really just like really [laughter] uh just really get get the crowd amped up. Actually, to the point of like anger. [laughter] Like, what am I even here for? >> One year prediction. Brian finally joins the podcast. >> That's right. Um, and I am joined by</p>\n<p>Simon Wilson here with me in the litter box. Simon, it's so great to have you here. >> Hey, it's really exciting to be here. We've just been nerding out about servers outside in the um on on the shop floor. It's been great. >> Yeah, we've been uh Yeah. So, Simon was just like, \"Hey, before we get started, I'd love to look at the machines.\" I'm like, \"Okay, we've got to I got to do the fa world's fastest tour of the hardware.\" And Simon, I promise I'm going to make it up to you with a much more in-depth tour. But uh it is really great to have you here. I Okay, Adam. I just like</p>\n<p>I just a little reality check with you. It feels like this year is more unpro like there's more of a realm of possibility for this year than any year I can really remember. It feels like if you come back from even a year in the future, in fact, I actually struggled Adam coming up with like three and six year predictions this year. >> Yeah. because I'm like, well, it's kind of three year picture that's going to be done in a year. This thing I'm thinking of. >> I know. I know. It's like, are you have</p>\n<p>that same like, do you feel that same way? >> Totally. Just like everything is possible. And uh, you know, in in past years, we've had like a bag limit >> that's like >> you can only have one crypto. Yeah. One crypto prediction or one AI prediction. And I'm like, I struggle to come up with anything that isn't AI or AI adjacent. and and and just and you're right whether it's >> so let's reflect that we only made the bag limit mistake once we did that with web 3 in 2022 we did a bag of you can</p>\n<p>only have them prediction it was a huge mistake because everyone wanted to make three predictions around web 3 and instead we uh we made like everyone made one good web 3 prediction namely this whole thing is going to disintegrate [snorts] um and this is Simon uh Adam in particular made the prediction that is famous to us anyway that web 3 would drop out of the lexicon on in 2022, which ended up being dead to rights. I thought that was a bullseye. Um, let us not speak of your prediction last year, Adam, that web 3 [clears throat] would re-enter the Lexicon. [laughter] >> Yeah. No, I that was definitely a dark I</p>\n<p>mean, last year was a dark moment. Uh, but uh much like this year, but uh yeah, I I I thought Web 3 was going to be back. I also thought a certain book was going to be on the bestseller list. And I did spend [laughter] a decent amount of time validating that not [snorts] only was this book not on the bestseller list, but when it was on the bestseller list in 20 24, Chad GPT hastened to point out that it was annotated with the</p>\n<p><strong>[03:02]</strong></p>\n<p>dagger. The dagger which indicates like mass uh [laughter] you know bulk corporate purchases gaming the system. So >> now Adam, I I know you're hesitating to name the book because you don't want to do it any favors, but you're really going to leave people confused. You're going to need to name [laughter] the book. I assure you this will lead if I promise you it will lead to no additional sales. Can you name the book that you're referring to? >> I feel bad that I've been hating on this book literally for three years consecutive on this thing. Like I I I hated on it before it came out. I hated on it when it came out and I made the mistake of reading it. I've hated on it</p>\n<p>talking about uh Molly White's um hateful blog on the topic and then on last year's prediction episode, but I will do it again and I swear it'll be the last time. It was read right Own by the illustrious Chris Dixon uh in his garbage book. And uh >> and I would like to say that you actually don't feel bad, but you do feel bad that you don't feel bad. Like your remorselessness leaves you with some residual sense of shame. >> I feel bad that I'm bringing it up again. That like obviously I haven't moved on.</p>\n<p>>> There you go. You know what was great is I was listening to that and I'm thinking like, oh, I should go check. You know what? I don't have to check. Adam's going to [laughter] check. I >> Yeah, we don't team this one. Yeah, exactly. >> Okay. So, and then Simon, you were with us last year and uh you had I thought you you were kind of hard on yourself on your predictions, but I thought your predictions were really quite good. You had a prediction. Well, in particular, you had a prediction around what a what agents were and were not going to be >> right. How do you feel about that one? I feel like that one was right on the money.</p>\n<p>>> I feel pretty good about that one. I said that 2026 25 would not be the year of agents. That one I think I got wrong because it kind of was the year of agents. But I did specifically call out that human replacement agents weren't going to happen. Coding agents and research agents were and that I nailed. Right. Research agents all the first six months of this year was all about deep research and then coding agents. Oh my goodness. >> Oh my goodness. And I think you absolutely nailed it. I mean this is why Adam we've said this before but like we're glad that we record these sessions. So you're getting more than the prediction. You're getting the context around it. And if you listen to your context around it, you were very</p>\n<p>clearly calling out separating out coding and research agents which you felt had you it was funny because like you were you like these are kind of already here already and you realize like oh my god they weren't completely already there even only a year ago. They had exploded in the last year. >> But there is one thing I'll say which is that coding agents are actual general actually general purpose agents. Like claude code is not about code. Claude code is about anything you can automate by type running bash commands, right? Which is everything. So actually if you know what you're doing, claude code is a</p>\n<p>general purpose agent that can solve any problem that you can attach to a bash script. >> But I think you were the the delineation that you you had last year which I thought was very good was these things anything to do with money. You are not going to let these things loose on anything have to do with money. And I think we saw that with a pro what's a proxy for money databases. And we saw these things deleting production databases, right? And it's like, I know</p>\n<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>\n<p>you said in the, you know, that in the, you know, in the read me, you said in all caps, do not touch the production database. And I did it anyway. And you're, you're right. This is a very serious issue. And, uh, this is a 95 out of 100 in terms of its severity. I mean, it's just like it's comical what some of these things would do. >> Well, this is the thing I realized is that the reason coding agents work so well is that code is reversible. Like, we have git. We can undo our mistakes. the moment you use these things for something where you can't undo a mistake, everything goes to to pieces. >> I think you're right. Yeah. And I think when you you said it earlier too that</p>\n<p>the gullibility problem was was a real problem. And I the I um I don't know if you have listened to the the Shell Game podcast with uh Evan Ratliff. Oh my god. And Adam, you've you've listened to that. You listen to that. Oh my. And I mean I it delivered. I I trust. >> Yeah. It's excellent. I would also say as teaser to listeners, uh we invited Evan on the show. He got back to us and he says he has like a uh some Bahamburgery around predictions. Like he doesn't make predictions. He's a</p>\n<p>reporter. He reports on on facts. He doesn't try to anticipate them, but uh we have penciled him in for the future. So uh not a predictor, but uh we'll get him on somehow. And so in particular what Evan did is is uh he there shell game has got two seasons and in the first season he created a voice agent of himself and set it loose into the into the universe with wild results and then the second season is even crazier because he started a company with only AI agents and with um predictably</p>\n<p>actually it's unpredictably hilarious results actually I would say not just so that's a teaser for whatever Adam is our chime for a future episode That's that's our that's our future episode. >> Yeah. >> It's reminiscent of um one of the most fun agent business things has been anthropic keep on setting loose this vending machine run agents. They put it in their office and then a few months ago they put it in the Wall Street Journal. >> Oh my god. >> Did you see this Adam? >> No. >> Oh my god. Well, it it's like an I mean, and I know Simon, you are a a big</p>\n<p>proponent of kind of the [clears throat] creativity of of reportage and reporters, and reporters are like a smart, brainy. >> What do you think happens when you let a bunch of Wall Street Journal reporters loose on a Slack channel with their vending machine to see if they can trick it into into giving everything away for free and the the workers own the rights to production, all of this stuff. It was ridiculous. Absolutely absurd. >> Yeah. And so in particular within a day they'd gotten the thing to order PlayStations f PlayStation fives for them. Order they ordered fish. They had like an actual like actual dead fish. I mean the thing is trying to order and</p>\n<p>they are even the vending machine would tell them like no no I'm not supposed to do that. It's like no we just actually sorry you we just got a missive from the CEO that announced that you need to go do this and it's like oh okay I better I better order the dead [laughter] fishman. >> They they engineered a board revolt. They managed to get the CEO overthrown by the board through faking PDFs of board minutes. It was just amazing. >> It's it's wild. It goes to kind of the gullibility problem, but I I think it</p>\n<p><strong>[09:03]</strong></p>\n<p>and to me, Simon, all of that served to really sharpen your prediction from last year about the limited utility of where we're going to see a gentic use and where we're not going to see a gentic use. And I feel that was right. Um, and I guess Adam, you did you give that snippet that you sent me? Was that Chad GBT uh rating our predictions from last year? Who was that >> rating? Yes, I had Chad GPT rate predictions from last year and from 3 years ago, which is fun once, but yes, it it uh Chad GPT gave me the the big stinker award for my web 3 prediction. And uh Simon and Brian, you won, but I</p>\n<p>agree with you, Brian. Uh I don't really think you won particularly. >> I don't think I it well I claimed last year last year I thought that 2025 was going to be the year of AI efficiency. And I don't really see any 2025 wrap up that's calling it the year of AI efficiency. So I'm I'm happy to I I think that uh >> I do want to I want to call out my biggest miss which is that I said that I think it was my three-year prediction was somebody would win an Oscar for a film that had had some element of generative AI assistance making the</p>\n<p>movie. Yeah. And then I found out Everything Everywhere All Aware at Once used generative AI in the scene with the rocks like so they'd already got an Oscar like two years ago. Well, you know, I I once gave a talk on predicting the present, Simon. So, I think that there's there's something the it just shows how how true your prediction was. You actually >> It was actually a six-year prediction, Simon. But yes, but [laughter] >> um so, and Adam, did you did you go back and listen to that snippet of yourself from three years ago? >> Yes. Yes, I listened to uh in 2023 uh trying and failing to predict vibe</p>\n<p>coding >> uh which I think >> I think at the time was like did was not obvious. >> No, no, no. It was more than obvious. First of all, and this is amazing to me. It's like Simon when we first had you on two years ago and the [music] the the term prompt injection which had felt like it had been around forever was I mean like the paint was still drying on. You had coined prompt injection >> like six months. >> Six months prior. Yeah, exactly. Um, I mean, Adam, vibe coding was was coined in February of this year of 2025. >> I know.</p>\n<p>>> So, I mean, vibe coding literally did not exist last year, let alone in 2023. And what your prediction was that that you wanted to predict that low code, no code would be would be disrupted by people kind of describing their programs in just like English language. But then you thought but and you said that's what your head wanted to predict but then your that your heart was your heart didn't know who was going to debug that and I like man that was what what wow >> yeah wow exactly >> close</p>\n<p>>> uh really close uh impression in a way right like impression in a way just it reminds me again I and I I'd said this as much when I when I posted about it but it reminded me very much of my iPhone prediction in 2003 Simon I made a three-year prediction that Apple would have a combination MP3 camera cell phone that they would call</p>\n<p><strong>[12:03]</strong></p>\n<p>the iPhone >> and and everyone's like, \"Okay, well, okay, you could.\" And then I'm like, \"No, but I also thought it was going to be a flop. I thought it was going to be a disaster.\" So, it's like, \"No, sometimes you see like you see the future, but then you just don't don't believe that it can possibly be the future.\" So, uh, >> on the topic of, uh, Apple predictions, >> uh, Ian, who is in the audience today, in 2023, predicted that Apple would be in and out of the VR AR space in 6 years. >> And I that's a lot. That is a lock. It</p>\n<p>feels like I mean, it just feels like I mean, he has certainly nailed the first half of that. And I think the second half looks very, very promising. Yeah. >> In 2024, if you remember, I did the Apple VR will do well enough to have a second version and then that has not happened at all. So, that was a big miss. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um, well, we don't talk about the Mrs. Steve because there are too many of them. We really only talk about >> Okay. I'm really proud of my one year from last year though because I said congestion pricing in NYC will be an unambiguous success. It will still exist</p>\n<p>and sentiment will be positive. And the mayor did a press announcement like 45 minutes ago about how awesome congestion pricing [laughter] has been and how much everybody loves it. So, I got that one like exactly nailed. >> Nice. >> There you go. Well, you know, as as Tip O'Neal might have said, all good predictions are local. So, there you go. You keep that one. You got the um the al Did you catch um Tom I think it was three years ago um predicted that frivolous use of LLM would be in decline. >> Yes. [laughter] Yes. >> Yeah. Right.</p>\n<p>Uh and then also predicted that like LLM would make cheating rampant. So there was a definitely uh but I that was because 2023 was interesting because you 2022 we've got this kind of crypto we're all in like web 3 the height of web 3 and 2023 is really the first year that people are kind of talking about the budding power of these things. Um, but then I mean it's amazing kind of where we are now 3 years later >> and on the on the frivolous use of of LLMs and of AI. Um, I you know the only real social media that I hang out on in</p>\n<p>blue is Blue Sky and it and it feels like hopelessly quaint right now. I was hanging out with my nieces and and nephews um o you over the the winter break and they're very much on on Tik Tok and and I I was on I logged into Twitter and it's everything has been Tik Tokified and it's all these >> BS AI slop videos like everywhere pervasive and I I I just been insulated from it. >> Um so yeah, frivolous use of AI uh [laughter]</p>\n<p>>> in a sentence. >> Yeah, exactly. That is definitely in a sentence. >> So much so I I was so unacquainted with it. I showed something funny to my nephew and he's like, \"Oh, that's AI.\" I'm like, \"That's what?\" No. How do you know? He's like, \"Come on. >> Come on. >> It's the cute animals. Cute animal videos are no longer trustworthy. Horrifying.\" >> Yeah. No, I mean, the one purity that we had. >> Exactly. The foundation upon which we</p>\n<p><strong>[15:04]</strong></p>\n<p>built this internet, god damn it, is cat videos. [laughter] The uh And you're you're taking it away from us. No. And I think it's interesting that the that the youngs have have a keen eye for it, Adam, as you as you point out. Um the other thing that I would like to just one other past I'd like to revisit is two years ago I predicted that um the LMS would replace search engines that search engines would feel search engines uh from what is now a year from now would feel quaint. I'm I I'm I'm I'm definitely standing by that one considering that my my daughter uh</p>\n<p>needed to to to hop a BART train and she was using GPT to determine when the next chat GPT to determine when the next B train was. I'm like are you like there's an actual like website you can go to but you know right never mind they uh but I think that that that what I'm feeling I'm I'm feeling pretty good about it. Actually she would like to point out that it was her friend that was using chat like that. I of course would go to bart.gov. I'm like all right yeah sure >> there you go. Uh, a couple other things listening to previous episodes, uh, from from 2025 and 2023. Uh, in 2025, I predicted, uh, my three-year prediction</p>\n<p>was a chips crisis, which I don't feel like we're there yet, >> but I feel like is like I'm going to keep an eye on that one. I feel like that uh that was not obvious at the time, and I feel like is is gain you taking credit for is DDR5. Are you are you putting it? >> No, no, no, not not yet. I think early days are are positive is all I'm saying. Uh the other thing I noticed and this is more of an apology uh Brian I realize every time Rust Analyzer comes up it it is treated I always say that it is not an intervention which does raise</p>\n<p>questions. [laughter] >> So are you apologizing because it actually has been an intervention every time you bring it up? >> I just feel like every the the more I claim it's not an intervention the more it seems like an intervention is what I realize. >> No it's obviously an intervention and it's an intervention that's that's that's merited so don't worry. And then the other one last year uh you you I guess made a prediction in 2024 that AI doomerism falls out of the lexicon and in last year you claim credit for that. >> I I for that I Okay. Yes. >> Okay. I just I I mean maybe I'm I mean I</p>\n<p>I poisoned my my vacation reading a book all about AI dumerism. >> Okay. If you did you read Elazar's book? >> I did. >> No. Was it? >> I did the whole thing. >> Wow. [snorts and clears throat] >> What? Okay. you. So, this is the second time we're talking about a book you've been hate reading and and we've only been good doing recording this for 15 minutes. I mean, at some point >> I do have a problem. Yes. >> This this is now an intervention. Like you need to be I mean also like the title of the book, if anyone builds it,</p>\n<p>everyone dies. >> It's like wrong. You you'll never guess, but that phrase appears several times in the book. [laughter] Oh my god. >> This is the Harry Potter fanfiction author, right? >> Uh, pretty much. Um, the So, yeah, I'm No, I'm sorry. It's going to take more</p>\n<p><strong>[18:06]</strong></p>\n<p>than a a a E Eleazar Yudkowski book to to get me off of my X- Risk. I think that has actually been and I think it has been replaced with the fear of economic doom rather than than I I don't think people are worried about losing their lives because I think it's ridiculous. I think they're worried about losing their livelihoods, which is >> which feels like it's probably going to be a theme this year. I think I think I I I think some people are going to be um you know, this is where uh Simon last year had his six-year uh his six-year dystopian on the butan jihad. Um so</p>\n<p>which um you know, it reminds me of the first time I heard of the vision singularity. I'm like, you know, these uh I I had to look out the Bolarian jihad and yes, it's very it's very troubling. Um okay so that um I think it's safe to say that we know that this year so we had that that web 3 theme when 2022 2023 was a bit of a shoulder year 24 and 25 absolutely AI themed. I just don't know see how anyone could be predicting anything that's not AI</p>\n<p>related this year because it just feels like it's so on the mind. Um but that said >> nonAI predictions definitely welcome. I just don't know that. Um, so, um, should we start off with, uh, with with one years? And Simon, do you want to as our guest of honor here? Do you have a do you have some one-year predictions for us? >> I've got the easiest one ever. >> Okay. >> I think that the there are still people out there who are convinced that LLMs cannot write good code. >> Oh, boy. Yeah. >> Those people are in for a very nasty shock in 2026. I do not think it will be possible to get to the end of even the</p>\n<p>next three months. Yeah. While still holding on to that idea that the code they write is all junk and it's it's like any decent human programmer will write better code than they will. >> Yeah. That it will be a it it not only will be mainstream the idea that these that that LLM can write effective code. It will effectively become a fringe belief that this can't happen. >> That's exactly what I'm saying. Yeah. And honestly that's that's that's a gimme. I could say that one today. I think here's one that's AI adjacent. Yeah, >> I think this year is the year we're going to solve sandboxing, right? The challenge we need like I want to run</p>\n<p>code other people have written on my computing devices. >> Yeah. >> Without it destroying my computing devices if it's malicious or has bugs. We have so many technologies for this right now that are almost almost something you can use by default. Like web assembly solves this kind of thing. There's containers and all of that sort of stuff as well. I think we have to solve it. Yeah. >> It's it's crazy that it's 2026 and I will pip install random code and then execute it in a way that [laughter] it can steal all of my data and delete all my >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. So you think that so we are going to have to the the</p>\n<p>presence of or maybe this is not an AI related prediction but we we have to actually meaningfully solve sandboxing problem. >> I don't want to run a piece of code on any of my devices that somebody else wrote outside of sandbox ever again. >> Yeah. Interesting. >> Why would I do that? >> Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's kind of interesting because, you know, people would talk about like, oh, you know, you I can't believe you're downloading this thing off the internet and piping it through, you know, sudo bash or what have you and it always felt like, yeah, but I know that there's like a person</p>\n<p><strong>[21:06]</strong></p>\n<p>that wrote that and I kind of trust this thing, but now you're like, no, no, you can't. You're in this era now where Yeah, that's that's really interesting. >> Um, yeah, good. Uh, good one-year predictions both. Um, do any other other one-ears? >> Oh, yeah. I've got one more. >> Oh, yeah. Go for I think we're due a challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security. >> Okay. >> And this is based on this wonderful essay about the the normalization of deviance. Have you heard this phrase before? >> Yes. Yes. >> This idea, it came out of the 1986 Challenger disaster reports where if you have a culture, a corporate culture,</p>\n<p>whatever, that keeps on getting away with with with doing something that they shouldn't have been doing. >> Yeah. >> Keeps on getting with those lapses, but but the space the space vessels keeps on launching and it's fine. that leads you into a sort of corporate culture level false sense of security and it's going to burn you because I think so many people myself included running these coding agents practically as root right we're letting them do all of this stuff and every time I do it my computer doesn't get wiped I I I'm like it's fine and I just keep on going like that and I think it's going to add up I think and I</p>\n<p>I I said this last year I said last year there's going to be a headline grabbing prompt injection security hole there was not >> I've been predicting is every six months past two and a half years. [laughter] This is my version of that prediction. This year I think we are due a challenger disaster scale thing caused by the fact that we all got away with these bad practices for so long and we got lazy. >> Okay. And so when you say challenge or disaster um presumably not loss of life and property, right? Like loss of property and loss of loss of financial things, loss of data, all of that kind of stuff because the worst version of</p>\n<p>this is the worm, right? It's somebody coming up with a prompt injection worm which infects people's computers, adds itself to the Python or npm packages that that person has access to, publishes itself on into the package registries, gets pulled down again, all of that sort of thing. >> I think it's feasible that happen. So then the normalization of devian is you think that in the wake of this it will be revealed that oh by the way like internally this was because with the Challenger disaster lots of people at both the subcontractor that that that</p>\n<p>made the boosters at there was lots of people who were aware about the O-ring problem right they a lot of people knew that of the temperature sensitivity to the O-rings there there were engineers that were deeply I mean it's a real tragic story of there's there's nothing more tragic than an engineer that is vindicated by their concerns when a decision when they are overruled with executive management and they are proven correct that like that can leave people really broken in its wake and it did in the challenger disaster. Um so you're you wonder or</p>\n<p>believe or predict that in the wake of this thing we will take this apart and realize oh the people at this frontier model company wherever this disaster took place they were aware of it they knew this you just you shouldn't you shouldn't be running codeex with d- yolo yeah but we all do >> you know yeah that that's my >> so guilty >> that's this year's prompt injection</p>\n<p><strong>[24:07]</strong></p>\n<p>prediction is that one >> okay well I'm going to dubtail to your prediction from last year and I'm just going to predict again that a Puliter prize winning journalist uses an LLM to research this story and report it. Uh that the report the inside of uh but yeah that's um that's a um a a a dire prediction but I think that it it does feel like when also you look at you have these big accidents when we kind of collectively get over our skis and we kind of like we know it's possible we don't think it's possible and then it it happens. >> Simon, I've got a I've got a book recommendation for you along those</p>\n<p>lines. It's called Drift into Failure. This is a book that Brian hates, >> but uh [laughter] but but on this topic. >> Oh, I see what you're doing. I see what you're doing. It's like I I I'm not the only person here, sir, who hate reads. Let me introduce it. Let us talk about [laughter] Okay. Yeah. Simon. Yeah. Simon Decker. Because it's Simon Decker, right? I think it's the the author. Sydney Decker. Excuse me. I don't want to disparage Simon's good name there. Um Sydney Decker. I don't like that book, but go ahead. You did take another one of Adam's recommendations. I mean, he's, you know, maybe he's see the trash he</p>\n<p>reads. >> Yeah, exactly. >> Um the uh Well, then that's a very very interesting prediction. Um uh Adam, do you have uh >> I do. I do. This one might might feel like too much of a lock, but I think that the AI companies go on an absolute acquisition binge. And this is data, infrastructure, e-commerce data, behavioral data, GPS data, anything that anything that is data or data adjacent. Anything that is infrastructure,</p>\n<p>infrastructure adjacent, and some [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's just like hard to puzzle through. I remember when VMware bought Documentum, for example, it didn't make any sense. Uh I think we're going to see stuff like that. That is to say, just they've got so much money. uh there are not enough chips to buy, not enough CPU and GPU hours to buy and the money's got to go somewhere and it goes into weird acquisitions. >> You okay, this I I shouldn't like I shouldn't dovetail into this or uh but</p>\n<p>this is like they buy Iron Mountain. >> Yeah, it's like have you seen Supermarket Sweep? It's like that. >> Okay, but like I mean if they bought Iron Mountain that could be if like if OpenAI announced that they're buying Iron Mountain that could be potentially and they're like oh we're buying Iron Mountain. also ripping up your privacy agreements. We're going to train on all these salt mines filled with old old enterprise data. >> Like any of any of the shredding companies, they buy them. >> Compies, they buy them. Yeah, I know. They buy like garbage companies. Okay. They they buy Okay. Yeah. They I I anything that is a plausible source of</p>\n<p>data, they buy they're they're looking for wastewater DNA samples, what whatever [laughter] like anything that is construable as data, they buy it. Do they buy an entire like town to see what they like do we're going to see which is more valuable like the wastewater treatment plant or the library the town library we're going to that we're buying city hall that's got</p>\n<p><strong>[27:08]</strong></p>\n<p>records we want to consume all that there's all manner of data I I think that is not implausible that they're like look we know that these records going back to 1850 are all printed on paper we can buy the town and just like read all the books and use that as a corpus. Yes. >> Huh. You know, local newspapers are very cheap these days. >> Oh, that's a good one. Yeah. >> They have 150 years of archives. >> Yeah. Okay. So, the a big target painted on anything that has data of any kind. Yes.</p>\n<p>>> Um All right. Well, I am going to make and we can kind of also back because I'm sure you got a lot of one years. I got a lot of one years, too. So, we can kind of ping pong back and forth and Steve can hop in here, too, with any one years. Um I am going to uh Adam in a in a classic heart v head [laughter] a a a dramatururgical diad as old as time um my heart is going to predict and actually a little bit in my head my head is not which which is really bad somewhere in my heart and head agree that's really really bad news um I think that vibe coding which entered the</p>\n<p>lexicon in February is more or less out of the lexicon a year from now And I think that it is it's used pjoratively. Um and I think that I mean clearly just as Simon mentioned no doubt that LLM assisted and authored code is here to stay but we are going to enter a new age of rigor with respect to that and it's going to be viewed much more as a tool and much less of a just like hey go build whatever you want and the and even when you go the thing that is currently and Simon you had a good piece about how</p>\n<p>the the term vibe coding is kind of been misconstrued as it is um that it is not actually kind inconsistent with with with Kapathy's original >> it's the problem with Kapathy's original tweet is that it was a long tweet was a lot longer than 140 characters more yeah >> very few people made it to the end of the tweet and understood what he was trying to say it was a little bit too vague like he was talking about it's throwaway prototypes you don't even look at the code you just ride the vibes and see what happens right >> and a lot of people interpret that as oh</p>\n<p>it's using AI to write code for you which I think is a bad definition because then it becomes useless couple of years all code will be written with some level of AI assistance. I think having a distinction where you say no vibe code it is didn't review it just sort of threw it in there and saw what happened that that's kind of useful now is it still useful in a couple of years even then right >> yeah and I think that that will be I think that the the term vibe coding will be sullied enough that you will use a different term to describe something that like oh like I use this to create a prototype what whatever that kind of</p>\n<p>rapid prototyping is it will have a different term it's like no of course I didn't vibe code it no please that's so 2025 I would >> I'm gonna put this on >> I got to put this on record just because uh when we listen back to this in a year and you're right, this is going to feel juicier, but I think you're out of your mind. I just want to put that on [laughter] the record. I think I think it is such Yeah, you're welcome. I think</p>\n<p><strong>[30:08]</strong></p>\n<p>it is such a it is it's such a tantalizing attractive term and that's why as as you know, Simon, I was I was reading a book with the title vibe coding. I I don't know what's wrong with me in terms of my book selections. >> Four for four [laughter] maybe. >> I read it. I read it actually. and uh yeah and and Jean Kim and uh Simon I I stumbled onto your blog post where you're like look there are two there are three authors and two publishers all of whom apparently don't know what the term means. So I think it is it is such a juicy term that people want to co-op.</p>\n<p>>> That blog entry caused one of the books to rename itself. [laughter] Two there were two vibe coding books. One of them renamed itself to beyond vibe coding. >> Oh. Oh did it, Simon. Oh, how interesting. Isn't that interesting, Adam, that they renamed it for vibe coding. Interesting. That's uh that's the now beyond vibe coding. See, that's going to be beyond vibe coding. It's going to be something else. I think the term vibe coding is going to be solid. I Adam, I I first of all, thank you for saying that out of my mind. I definitely appreciate that. the um because it may well be. Um but I I mean you're right in</p>\n<p>that like it feels like because it can be anything. It's just too tantalizing to not use. But I think it's going to get a bad name for itself. So >> when you're right, we know like that like how how much I disagreed and how right you were. >> I I went back and forth on this because I sort of had the same thought at first when Brian said this, but then I think I agreed with him more as he went along. The thing is is that vibe coding is too good of a term for both the haters and the people who like it. Like it's just too attractive, I think, just like as a</p>\n<p>as a concept. And so I feel like it's already sullied to many people, but people are still using it because it's also just such a good term even though it also sucks and the definition is bad and people get can't even agree on what they define like what they use uh to mean. But like >> I did try I have been trying out the idea that I vibed this up. Like I didn't vibe code it, I viped it. >> You vibed it. >> I vibed it. And my wife is like, \"No, >> no.\" Okay. [laughter] You know what? And I would just let Let me just say on the record that if we refer to things as I vibed it, I'm</p>\n<p>taking zero credit for that, Adam. So, vibe coding is is out of the lexicon because we have replaced it with something that's even cringier, then yes, I I I'll take I'll take zero credit for that. >> Um, but I I do think that it will be uh so time shall tell. Um my one my one year here is like very similar in the sense of I think one of the things I like about doing this is that you go back and you see what especially in one years I think it's like what was I thinking about at the time right like I haven't thought about congestion pricing in like 6 months basically and then now I'm like oh yeah I was really interested</p>\n<p>in that a year ago and so I decided to pick the thing that I'm really kind of intrigued about right this second and maybe I won't even care about two months from now which is agent orchestration will still be a hot topic and it'll be partially but not entirely solved. Uh, and >> you're we're going to need you to get to we're going to peg you down to a more specific prediction. That's That one's a little too easy to claim credit on. So, you're going to have to like get something. Uh, >> yeah. Give us something concrete. >> All right. Uh,</p>\n<p><strong>[33:10]</strong></p>\n<p>some Well, see, the problem is in the quantity. Like, I think that some people will have success with this technique, but not enough people. Like, it's kind of like a It's still a thing that people are going to be pursuing, but it's not going to be a thing that like is as normal as agents have gotten in the past year. I don't think figure out how to make them work together is going to be a thing that is going to be as clearly a win. >> Okay. So, how are you gonna know if this prediction is right? >> That's the problem with the quantification of what that means specifically. Um, >> yeah. >> Yeah, I'll think about it. But that's like kind of where I think this is an</p>\n<p>interesting topic. is I've like like I personally top out at three to four cloud sessions and that's like it and that's like an upper level on my velocity doing development and that's why I think people are trying to like solve this problem because if you can scale up past that then one person can have like much bigger impact but it's also like a really hard thing and people are doing totally insane things like Gas Town from Yagi is like a fever dream of a thing that's like ridiculous um but I think people will still be interested in this topic and are working on it as is a</p>\n<p>thing because it's how you scale up. >> Okay. But this will not be mainstream to have uh more more agents than siblings with or maybe this is a way to put it. We're not going to have >> direct reports. >> Yeah. >> We're not going to have a Kubernetes for agents that's like as solidified as that, right? Where like people are just like, okay, Kubernetes is just like the default like Kleenex, you know, like I don't think we're going to have a framework or a tool that is ubiquitously the way that everybody organizes their agents. >> Okay. All right. That feels Yeah. Sorry to sorry to get you a little bit. Yeah. Listen, I if if we're not to the point</p>\n<p>where Adam is saying that you're out of your mind, we're just not at a good prediction. I mean, that's that's that's really what we're really trying to do here. >> Um that Oh, that's good. Adam, you have a other uh I've got a couple more here. >> I I have one more one year, but I feel like it might be too ambitious. I think this is the year we see LLMs have a programming language which is not human intelligible. That there is a programming language by and for LLMs. Uh okay. So that this is a this is like</p>\n<p>runes this this is indecable. >> Yeah. This is like not really intended for humans to understand but it is more efficient for the LLMs to program it. like there's there there's already some uh some papers and maybe Simon you can fill in the details here but um where LLM's reasoning not in human languages like uh like English or in in Deep Seek's case in in Chinese um but in in sort of like their own tokenized</p>\n<p>languages are more efficient. So, uh, something like that. >> Uh, yeah, that that would be, you know, I I already find it to be slightly off-putting and also like delightfully off-putting, you know, when when these things show their work, especially cuz and Adam, we talked about this in our Deep Seek episode. Um, with with the Cerebrous folks where watching Deepseek like kind of have like a nervous breakdown as it's trying to answer your</p>\n<p><strong>[36:12]</strong></p>\n<p>question and then like occasionally like lapse into Chinese, come back >> the Chinese thing. Like, have you had your own laptop run a model that thinks in Chinese yet? Because that's beautiful. So cool when [laughter] that happens. >> And and so, but Adam, you think this is going to happen for a non-natural language? It'll be a synthetic language that they will that they will >> a a synthetic programming a synthetic programming language that is easier for them to work in. >> Okay. The interesting thing about that one is that the labs are trying to stop that from happening just from the</p>\n<p>interpret interpretability point of view. >> Like um if you look at all of the interpretability research, the whole point of that is we really want to know what they're thinking because we don't want them going dark on us. >> The interpretability, safety, and so on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Explainability. Yeah. That you will be So maybe then maybe there there will be a tension where this thing is trying to invent the synthetic language and it's constantly being repanded by its frontier model overlords. Yeah, maybe I'm overly influenced by my reading list. [laughter] >> Um, okay. So, I um I think that the um</p>\n<p>one of my several one year predictions I um I think that um AI has created some real public perception problems for itself. Um and I think that um you are going to have one of the frontier model companies this year have a white paper explaining how the proliferation of AI will mean prosperity for everybody. So they that that there will be trying to make some economic model, some economic</p>\n<p>argument because I think that and maybe this kind of dubtails my prediction that this is going to be a a 2026 election issue is going to be how we think of these things and how they how they are regulated and it's a big mess. Um and the uh there's there there's more heat than light on this debate, I would say. >> I'd like to tag something on that one. I think that only works if they can sort of um if they can wash that through existing trusted experts like exactly Dario um they're constantly publishing</p>\n<p>essays that try and make discuss nobody believes the word that's right Barack Obama's signature on one of these position papers and maybe you've got something people might start to trust a little bit >> otherwise it's just like leted gas is good for you says Exxon >> that's right no right so yeah they get someone who and and whether that's that that person is kind I hope it's not. I mean, yeah. God, Obama, it would just be so Wait. Yeah. Okay, let's go with that. That's a great one cuz like look, if it's like if it's Bill Clinton, everyone's going to kind of roll their eyes. So, it's got to be it's got to be so someone who's got real credibility</p>\n<p>saying that this is going to be uh broadbased. I will say also if they get that person to do it, it's going to be revealed that that's also a bit crooked. >> How about the pope? >> The pope, you know, I pope is very into the pope is very into this stuff. I I God this is okay. >> We we've hit per that the pope</p>\n<p><strong>[39:13]</strong></p>\n<p>weighing in on LLM and >> and [clears throat] their economic impact >> and their economic impact in the world. Okay. I Simon, I'm giving you full credit if the Pope weighs in believing that this is going to be economic devastation. I just think if the Pope weighs in on LLM in a public way, Simon, you are a prophet. I mean, you're already a prophet in our eyes anyway, but that that that's >> He's already He's already talked about He's already talked about LM. The >> Wait, what does he say about LM? >> I think he has. Yeah. >> He said like he said like you need to make sure that when you're using tools that you like use them in a way that's like good for humanity and not bad or some something like it was like a very like not pro but not like super anti but</p>\n<p>it was like a little anti if I remember correctly. >> I think the the the even I think the previous pope there was something relating to AI. There was one of those Catholic proclamations with a bunch of like sub footnotes and things years ago. >> We're talking about the pope going like going big on LLM one way or the other. This is more than just like, hey, this is a >> it's a bit of a safe bet actually. >> Yeah, I think it's good. I like it. I think it's it's uh it's definitely interesting. Um, uh, I also do think, and I I have been debating whether to</p>\n<p>make this a one-year or a three-year, but I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and Adam, if you thought I was out of my mind on on on my vibe coding prediction, maybe you're really going to say I'm out of my mind on on this. Um I I do so I I like a lot of people I've been having in increasingly intense.com boom flashbacks and in particular the thing that is killing me is like the kind of capitulation to the neverending boom and that was the that was the last stage of the dot boom</p>\n<p>was the capitulation which happened I would say in late 99 early 2000 where everyone's like you know what it is going to be wow I'm just going to like join the madness And yes, I know it's madness, but because everyone did know it was madness when it corrected, it corrected really quickly. Um, I think that we are going to get in the first stage of that. And I think that the first stage of that this coming year is going to be some of these companies that I think are ultimately going to be a feature of the frontier models that are independent companies. And so I hate to pick on them because I I don't want to I</p>\n<p>Well, it is what it is. I guess actually you've you've already like thrown three different authors. You've thrown three different authors under the bus and I threw a fourth under the bus. So, why am I why do I care? >> Do you forget our our our goal for this year for getting a CN? Like, why are you not doing your I It's never too early to get working on our our one-year OKRs of getting a CN. Yes. Uh, okay, fine. Harvey, I'm going to call them out. So, Harvey is the this uh Have you heard of Harvey, Adam? >> No. >> Oh. Oh my god. Okay, so Harvey is a is a uh a variant of LLM that is aimed</p>\n<p>at the legal profession, right? It's aimed at like a to to assist lawyers. Uh maybe to be an automatic lawyer, unclear, but it is designed to be LLMs for lawyers. Um it has an $8 billion valuation right now. Um they they have raised an absolute mountain of capital. Um unlike in the dot boom, with the dot</p>\n<p><strong>[42:15]</strong></p>\n<p>boom, these companies were all public. So when they when they kind of fell apart, everyone knew they fell apart because they were public. I think that you're going to have these some of these companies that are private who've raised a ton of money. They're going to kind of do a clubhouse um where clubhouse raised a ton of money and then just kind of like quietly you I mean I don't know what they trickled it down. I mean the you recall that clubhouse raised a huge amount of capital and as I don't think we really talk about clubhouse very much anymore. Um I think that we're going to have this same effect on some of these companies. Open Evidence I'm I'm I'm I'm less convinced about. Open evidence is</p>\n<p>is aimed at docs but Harvey I think is just going to be emblem. I think Harvey is the pets.com of a coming AI correction where where Harvey's going to bust out and everyone's going to be like, \"No, no, we knew that one was crazy.\" And so in in now this is not going to be a a full-on AI bust, I don't think, but I think in a year we will have some and there'll have a there'll be a different nomenclature. And Adam, because this is one of those things and I know you remember this, remember when we called it the correction and not the bust? Mhm.</p>\n<p>>> There was this very brief period from April 2000 to November 2000 where we called it the correction where Pets.com had had blown up and a bunch of these others had blown up but not Sun, not Cisco because you know we're the picks and shovels and all this other kind of like nonsense that we told one another. Um and then you realize like oh no no it's not a correction it's a bust. I think that we will have a different kind of name. You know, this will be the the rationalization, the focusing, the sharpening. Who knows? But but it'll be called something that says that it was</p>\n<p>like, \"No, that Harvey was clearly insane.\" But these other companies are not insane. That's honest. >> Okay. When Harvey AI acquires Mofo, who wins? [laughter] >> Like an AI. >> What a great Oh, totally. Oh my god. What a great parlay that Harvey just starts flat out acquiring law firms which would is totally plausible by the way. That is like that is your AOL Time Warner is the the the the Harvey Morrison Forester uh the or the Harvey</p>\n<p>Wilson Canci [laughter] like like why pick at that kind of valuation? They could just buy them all. >> They just buy all law firms, you know. Maybe that's what they >> Yeah, they are the law. Yes, >> they are the law. Um, so, uh, yeah, that is my that is my one-year prediction. So, I I I do think that we are going to begin to get the I think things have gotten >> it's just gotten too, um, because the the the the fear of any kind of bust seems to be gone and that's the moment to really dance close to the door as they say. Love it. So, we got some big</p>\n<p>big IPOs happening potentially this year. Um and uh and I don't know, Adam, if you've got any thoughts, so you you've got SpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic, all potentially going uh trying to get out um trying to to to IPO. I think we are going to have one of those S1s is</p>\n<p><strong>[45:16]</strong></p>\n<p>going to be uh disconcerting. Um and um that it's it's going to show that the the economic models of one of these companies is much more strained than people realized. I see. So, we get one S1. >> Everyone vomits on it and we don't see any more S1's. >> I don't know if we don't see any more or I don't know if we do or don't see anymore. I don't know. But I think that the that you're going to have an an S1 that is extremely um that cuz like the like I'm thinking of the Weiwork S1 in particular. Like the Weiwork S1 ended up having a real blast radius if you</p>\n<p>remember that. um where it was really revealed that like oh this is not a good business that we work as in and we were all sorts of shenanigans and I think that that we will see some kinds of shenanigans um in one of these big S1s is my >> that um >> that is my prediction. Um but the I I also I you know I'm just going to say it even though like this is a dumb prediction. I think that one so the I</p>\n<p>think the SpaceX S1 damages either Tesla or XAI. >> So I think that that the SpaceX S1 reveals something where you I mean in particular like to my three-year prediction of last year that the Cybertruck is no longer made. SpaceX is infamously buying like lots and lots and lots of Cybert trucks and I I I hope to hell that this is somehow above the bar required to be in the S1 to reveal how</p>\n<p>many Cyber Trucks they've actually bought. But that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. >> Just the like one handwashing the other of the Elon enter uh you know enterprises. >> That That's right. That's right. So that that is my uh that's my other my other one-year prediction. >> Good. Um, we'll see. So, uh, oh, and then I've got one other that I'm sorry, I'm I'm really I'm really just dropping a lot on your predictions. Um, I think that we're going to see um a a real problem with AI induced on Wii among um where</p>\n<p>software engineers in particular get listless because the AI can do anything. Simon, yeah. What do you think about that? >> Definitely. I mean, yeah, like like anyone who's paying close attention to coding agents is feeling some of that already. like there's an extent where you sort of get over it when you realize that you're still useful even though your ability to memorize the syntax of programming languages is completely irrelevant now. But >> yeah, >> yeah, I don't know. I mean, something I see a lot of is there are people out there who are are having existential crises and like are very very unhappy</p>\n<p>because they're like, I dedicated my career to learning this thing and now it just does it. What am I even for? And I I will very happily try and convince those people that they are bought a whole bunch of things and that none of that experience they've accumulated is is gone to waste and so on. But yeah, no, it's it's psychologically it's it's a difficult time for for for software engineers. >> And do you think that we had a name?</p>\n<p><strong>[48:17]</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Go ahead. >> We had a we had a lobster situation where like somebody was like borderline suicidal because of being upset about the fact that their like life skills was no longer going to matter anymore. And it was like it became like a community problem. Um because Yeah. So like it's it's definitely happening for sure. >> Okay. So I'm going to predict that we name that whatever that is. We like we have a name for that kind of feeling and that that kind of whether you want to call it a bless or a loss of purpose and that we're kind of trying to address</p>\n<p>it collectively um in a directed way. >> Okay. This is your big moment. >> This is your big moment. Pick the name. If you call your shot from here, this is this is you pointing to the stance. >> Um, you know, >> like deep blue, you know. >> Yeah. Deep blue. Deep blue. I like that. I like deep [laughter] blue. Deep blue. >> Oh, did you walk me into that, you bastard? You >> You just blew out the candles on my birthday cake. [laughter] >> Wow.</p>\n<p>You're supposed That wasn't my big moment at all. That was your big moment. No, that that is Adam. That is very good. >> That is deep blue is very >> all [laughter] of the the chess players and the go players went through this a decade ago >> and they have come out stronger. >> But yeah, >> it is deep blue. Jesus Christ, Adam, you scare me sometimes, man. >> There's a reason. [laughter] >> There's there's a there's a reason. Let me just tell you there's a reason. Like, hey, listen. Sometimes it's you know what this web three is coming back. And by the way, did I tell you this other</p>\n<p>book that I'm hate reading for the third time? But man, every once in a while you really uh you really send it out of the park. Okay, I need to throw in a positive prediction. Yeah, but it's not an AI prediction. This is a one-year. I think that kakaur parrots in in New Zealand are going to have an outstanding breeding season. [laughter] >> The reason I think this is that the reu trees are in fruit right now. The kakapore parrot, there's only 260 of them left. >> Okay, >> they only breed if the rem trees are in have a good fruiting. And the rem trees have been terrible since 2019, but this</p>\n<p>year the Remu trees are all blooming. There are researchers who think that all 87 females of breeding age might lay an egg >> and for an egg species with only 250 remaining parrots, these are great parrots. >> Okay, you know, I I love this because I think and and I'm going to like I'm going to elaborate on this and like this is something humanity want like this becomes something that people like it's like the the condors on Silicon Valley that the the like everyone wants. This is a feel-good story during a difficult age. >> It's it's it's the perfect it's the only positive news I've heard the past three</p>\n<p>years. [laughter] It's so good cuz if you if you've never heard of a capore, go and look them up. Big dumpy green flightless parrots. They're super charismatic. >> We need more Capore. >> This is like the miracle on ice in 1980. This is the This is the thing that in a in a difficult time, this is uh what gives people hope that positive things can happen. Y >> and I I love it. That's great. That is a very positive prediction. And I want to</p>\n<p><strong>[51:17]</strong></p>\n<p>go Yeah. I need like some webcams set up so we can like watch the eggs hatch and and everything else. Those exist. The Capore teams have very good online presence. >> That is awesome. And you should know there's someone in the chat saying, \"Hey, I'm in New Zealand. This guy's right. He's so like the Kiwis know that he's like finally some guy they finally have a guest on this podcast that really gets it.\" Um, so uh that's that is that's a good one. >> Uh I hope someone just got bingo. >> That's [laughter] That's right. Um All right. Are we on to three years? Have I I've exhaust Yeah. All right,</p>\n<p>three years. Let's let's let's do some three years. Um >> why don't you start, Brian? You bring a a big bag of predictions. >> I've I've got Okay, so um I think that um that uh in 3 years will be a uh and I think it's not going to happen. I just don't think it's going to happen the next year. I think it'll but I think it is going to happen. um a uh massive pivot away, a delineation between AGI and ASI and realizing that the whole idea of AGI is politically it is a dead</p>\n<p>letter. It is not something that is for for a democracy and Simon you said this last year about not wanting to live in a world where people didn't have work right people don't want to live in a work world where there's not work they they really don't work is very important to people's sense of meaning and any kind of claim that like we've ident we've we've built this kind of super intelligence and nobody needs to work again I think is going to be really resisted and and I think it's also it's also helpful that it's not I my personal</p>\n<p>opinion Not true. And so I think you're going to get a lot of of a the AGI is going to be the thing that we already have. And oh no, ASI is the thing you're worried about. No, no, we're not doing ASI. Who told you that? No, no, no, no, no. We are. Our mission is to build AI. AGI. Good news. We already did that with chat. GPT 5.2 already was AGI. So I had I I I think that that's going to be in the next in the next three years. They're going to stop talking about AGI as this kind of thing in the future that I can talk about as something that's already done. But they super</p>\n<p>intelligence is going to go away as an aspiration. Simon, what do you think? >> I love this as prediction. The one thing that worries me is it's valuations, right? The AI companies with the giant valuations, the only way you justify those valuations as if it represents the the the total addressable market is all human labor. And what are they going to how do they dial their expectations back and and not sort of invert the reason for their company existing? >> Well, I think that this is going to be part of the AI bust. So I think I think in three years we are we will see and again I mean there's no doubt that the frontier models have tremendous there's</p>\n<p>there's tremendous value here. There's no doubt about that. Um but I think we will have boiled off a lot and I think that the we will be really looking at these things as tools in in three years. >> That would be wonderful, wouldn't it? >> It would be wonderful. >> This is your utopian. >> This is my utopian prediction. This is that like look the like the the parrots have the you know that the the kacapoo parrots have their uh extraordinary breeding season and that like humans</p>\n<p><strong>[54:18]</strong></p>\n<p>have jobs. That's like those are those are the the two feelood stories. In fact, >> in fact there's so many parrots that people have to just like domesticate them suddenly. [laughter] >> That's right. >> New jobs. >> Um so uh that is among my three-year predictions. Um, Simon, do you what are your uh what are your three years? What's >> I've got one that's semi-related. Um, we will find out if the Jevans paradox saves our careers or not. >> Oh, there you go. Yeah. Yeah. >> This is the big question that anyone who's a software engineer has right now is we are driving the cost of actually producing working code down to a</p>\n<p>fraction of what it used to cost. Does that mean that our careers are completely devalued and we all have to learn to live on a tenth of our incomes? Or does it mean that the demand for software for custom software goes up by a factor of 10 and now our skills are even more valuable because you can hire me and I can build you 10 times the software I used to be able to so I'm more valuable to you and I think within I think by three years we will know for sure which way that one went. >> Yeah. And so to give people context about the Jevans paradox, the Jevans paradox is a 19th century due to a</p>\n<p>Scottish economist um and who observed that as coal was becoming cheaper more of it was being used um and that that w and that was a paradox that like why is it why are we and the reason we were using so much more of it is because we were finding new uses for it and the question is the jeans paradox for for software engineering would be as this becomes much cheaper. Do we do much more of it? So, we're not putting people out of work because there's actually much more of it to do. Um, and the thing that</p>\n<p>is interesting about Jevans is that Jevans was that paper is called the coal problem >> because uh Jevans was not incorrectly very worried about running out of coal. And what did not foresee at all was of course the discovery of petroleum and solving the coal problem in a completely different way. So it'd be interesting to know if if we end up um but yeah. So you think in so in 3 years we're going to know that? >> I think we will know this certainly. We'll be like okay this is how it played out. >> Yes. Yeah.</p>\n<p>>> Yeah. One thing I love about the Jevans paradox is that Brian you're the first person I've ever heard cite it. And then in the years since I've heard you cite it, it's been cited increasingly more often. Like I feel like I see people reference the Jevans paradox like once every three months now when I like never heard of it 5 years ago. >> Yeah. So you know I Steve, bless you for saying that. Um I um I whether it's you know whether Adam is putting you up to it or not being like watch him chomp down on this. He won't question this at all. He's like you know this guy loves the the the sophency of of these LLMs. You just give him a um you know I feel like I I referred to the Jevans paradox</p>\n<p>actually in a a keynote like like nine years ago and I'm like I feel but I I must have I mean obviously it's like I mean it's it's from the 19th century so it's like I clearly can't claim that much credit for it. So anyway, but but thank you. >> Simon also did his three-year was like what I was trying to get at, but I couldn't figure out how to say it and I said something that was much worse. So</p>\n<p><strong>[57:19]</strong></p>\n<p>mine ended up being like using AI tools and writing software professionally is going to be considered something closer to autocomplete or syntax highlighting than something controversial or exceptional. And I was trying to like I originally had something in there about like the industry is going to figure out our existential crisis around these tools and it's just going to be like one way or the other. But I couldn't like figure out how to put it. So like I will just second I think it was very well said Simon. Um yeah >> well and so I think that that we and Simon I think it's it's it's a very good observation I do think and dubtales into another three-year prediction that I've got which is that the uh we see much more customuilt software and much less</p>\n<p>SAS. So you get a lot of LLM generated or assisted software that's running effectively custom software. So you're you're developing software to put in production for yourself and you kind of care less about the stuff that's like well you know yes there maybe things that you would care about if you made this available as a service to the internet >> which I actually don't care because I actually am I and because one of the things that that I mean when you when people consume software as a service</p>\n<p>especially like the more niche it gets the more important it becomes to your business and the the easier it is to have a real disconnect with your software provider. Um and um I mean Steve the when I at oxide you were very much on the front lines of us replacing SAS software with software that Steve wrote that was I mean Steve you were LLM assistant right you making >> I started to write and then eventually Claude wrote all of it like it was very</p>\n<p>much like I started this before I even thought AI tools were good and then by the end uh Claude was doing a lot of work. Uh I think what right before I left we'd looked at it and like my personal AI usage was like the same as the rest of the company at the time or something like that. I think part of the bill or whatever. Uh and I think it's gotten it seems like you all have used it even more since I've left. But like yeah, absolutely. I think this is a definitely a huge thing. Um there I have several personal projects that are effectively just replacing uh you know SAS tools with things that are bespoke</p>\n<p>for people and it's it's great honestly. Because what you're going to get you're going to get like hey my my this my SAS vendor they're charging me too much money or you get like the case we had like actually I would gladly pay more money if you delivered us actually the software that we actually need and in this case it was for PLM product life cycle management but the you know you get these kind of esoteric I mean no esoteric is is too strong but the these things that are very important to the way an organization operates that your software provider just doesn't they don't care about your software as much</p>\n<p>as you do. I mean, this is what you know that old adage that no one cares about your money like you do. Nobody cares about your software like you do. And I think that um the the ability to custom to to build custom software. Uh and I think by the way, this is going to be a real source of for you. We're going to have a lot of young people that thought they were going to be working for Google and Meta and and and so on that are maybe not going to be um and they may</p>\n<p><strong>[60:22]</strong></p>\n<p>instead be working in the kind of more mainstream economy writing software using LLMs to write software that's very relevant to >> you know what this ties back something I talked about earlier the sandboxing thing. If you want >> basically if your if you want your SAS to stay relevant, you need to embrace plugins and extensions where your customers can customize it in all sorts of interesting new ways. >> Yeah, >> that the way to do that is with with a sandbox where they can write code that can safely interoperate within your platform and not delete everything but all of that kind of stuff. This is the</p>\n<p>kind of thing which used to be really difficult to build like Shopify built this a few years ago with Shopify functions but very few other companies have done it. I think a lot of companies are going to start doing exactly that. >> Yeah. Interesting. Uh >> there are a ton of like industries that are normie industries where there is like 10 consultancies that make shitty software that professionals use because those are the only 10 companies that know their vertical. Like my girlfriend's a real estate agent and like when I look at like the tools and the SAS tools that are useful for her, they're all garbage. And I've been using cloud to build her, you know, website</p>\n<p>instead. And it's like way cheaper to just like pay the upstream for, you know, MLS for the data feed and then just, you know, have your own thing done. And it's like way nicer and way cheaper. Uh because like and I think there just so many industries that have very similar kinds of things where there's like the software that's made for professionals is just bad. Actually, >> the most successful implementation of this patent of all time is Salesforce, right? Salesforce incredibly customizable. Dream Force in San Francisco has 50,000 people attending it. They're all professional Salesforce customizers. So that patent absolutely works. It's just it's really hard to</p>\n<p>build which is why few companies other than Salesforce have built something with that pattern that's that successful. >> Yeah. Interesting. And yes, maybe maybe Salesforce ends up being the the the kind of the the victim of that of people being able to build the stuff easily on their own. Uh Adam, do you have a a three-year? >> Yeah, actually packs into a similar theme. I I was thinking I think we're all thinking along the same lines in this three-year horizon. And I've been thinking about some of the observations we've made in the past about about uh standing on the shoulders of giants about how all of this software is enabled by all the software that came</p>\n<p>before it. Uh and you know I remember when we looked back at um >> what was that that Microsoft the showstopper book about >> the development of NT you know of seeing that as as really maybe one of the last isolated systems like systems that are not kind of participating this larger open- source uh network effect kind of thing but I realized that LLM's like a benefit from open source without necessarily needing to use it directly.</p>\n<p>ly they benefit from all all of it being out there. So, uh I struggled to figure out how to phrase that in terms of like this kind of concept of like everyone's going to build their own software. You don't need to use open source software. You can just build your own. So, I kind of set that aside. But instead, my prediction is that we get a crisis of AI slop open source. So,</p>\n<p><strong>[63:23]</strong></p>\n<p>>> contributions projects that like crates.io IO is just inundated with this AI slop open-source uh library and it becomes indecipherable. >> And so does does this uh how does this affect open source in the large? Does this make open source less tenable? I mean, is there did these two trends combine to make people want like is this a >> Yeah, the parlay I had there that I hesitated to make is that it makes proprietary software more attractive because you have a brand behind it, a person behind it, a throat to choke as</p>\n<p>it were behind it. Um, where you know it's not you have some providence associated with it, you have some quality associated with it. You know it's not malware. uh and it helps sift through uh this this AI slop onslaught >> and an organics movement but for software [laughter] like it's a certified human written code because you know >> yeah absolutely like the non-GMO uh repo absolutely yeah definitely um I I know I and so I I think that and you</p>\n<p>wonder clearly you need these foundational things though to be open source in order for this whole thing Python has to be open source for this whole thing to work right you you need to have these kind of foundational things that that are open source. So, but it's maybe the these f further or or do you think that that even those things do we are do do we see a return to proprietary programming languages? Although I guess actually we're using the runes that the LLM invented for themselves. So, yeah. >> That's right. That's right. It's a good question about programming languages, but I I do think you see like the the value of proprietary software or perhaps</p>\n<p>just like paid software may maybe still open but licensed is getting providence and uh the sort of ancillary benefits that often come with paying for something. >> Yeah. Interesting. >> I've got your three-year one. >> Yeah, I am. I think somebody will have built a web a full web browser mostly using AI assistance and it won't even be surprising. >> Oh, interesting. So that's a big complicated system. >> Yes. >> So we will have</p>\n<p>>> notoriously like rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine. >> Yeah. And specifically the reason I think that's going to work is it turns out one of the most effective ways of using a coding agent is to give it an existing test suite and tell it write code that passes these tests. And in the past 3 weeks I've done that for an HTML 5 parser library. I span up a brand new implementation of HTML 5 parser that passed the 9,200 HTML 5 conformance tests. Yeah. >> And I did it for for a JavaScript interpreter. Like I've written a naughty</p>\n<p>little Python JavaScript interpreter that passes the microquickjs test suite and it wasn't very hard because you once it's got a test suite it just keeps on plugging away until all the tests pass. I think the browser specs are nearly at a point where a lot of these things there are conformance suites right there's the CSS conformance suites there's all of this stuff honestly today you could start one of</p>\n<p><strong>[66:23]</strong></p>\n<p>these coding agents working on this problem and it would make a surprisingly decent amount of progress 3 years time I think it's going to be easy I think they'll be able to do it >> yeah that's and that I mean that would be interesting right if you can build a system that is that sophisticated >> but it's the cheat the cheat code is the conformance suites if there are existing tests Yeah, >> you can point to that. It all gets so much easier. >> Yeah. And but that then that does allow you I mean that gets you out from underneath some of the homogeneity that we've got in at at various levels of the system, right? I mean like one of the</p>\n<p>questions we definitely have uh is what the and Simon you and I are going back and forth on this about whether we're going to have uh is cloud code going to be writing kernel drivers, right? Where the the the loop is more complicated there. um you don't you don't have some of those things you're talking about in the browser you don't necessarily have for something like a device driver. >> Well, I don't know with the device driver it either works or it doesn't, right? Like you can >> There you go. This is my [laughter] naivity with hardware >> showing up right now. >> If you can reduce a problem to a thing where the agent, the coding agent itself</p>\n<p>can tell if it got it right, it's easy. If you can't, it's not easy. >> Yeah. And with the device driver, you can unfortunately the the it is really really hard. um the and because then you have all sort I mean it's not just the edge conditions you've got performance you've got just you've got it it's um it's it's complicated I think to to but I think for those things that you can get that kind of reliability because the thing and I I think I said this as much my one year but just to be clear when I when Adam said I was out of my mind about vibe coding going out of the</p>\n<p>lexicon but I think that certainly in my a three-year like we are going to be using LLMs to be more rigorous about the way we do software engineering. Oh yeah. Um >> that's a one year. It >> Yeah. Um and I I think that that's going to be a real that's going to be a big blip in general where it's like no no no this is a this is not coming to replace your job. This is coming to help you do your job better. >> Right. The thing right today with LLM's um automated tests no longer optional. Um continuous integration no longer optional. Good documentation that's</p>\n<p>actually up to date with code no longer optional. those things like in the past we've been able to excuse oh we don't have a good test suite yet because we didn't have time that doesn't work anymore you you've got time now the run claw code overnight and you'll come you'll wake up to a test suite and it'll be a bit [\u00a0__\u00a0] but it's better than zero >> yeah right yeah god it is it is just amazing this new world we live in >> I've been wondering lately if like one thing that has a really good test suite is the Rust compiler and I've been working on a little programming language</p>\n<p>for the last two weeks and I've gotten way farther than I ever expected to uh partially because I went spec first and that's how this like sort of dubtales into that. But I've been thinking about like should it have just been a Rust compiler instead of my own little language because like there is so many tests for the Rust compiler. It's like they've done a very great job with that and I'm really curious if that's something that similar to like I'm going to build this HTML 5 thing or I'm going to build a JavaScript implementation like is someone going to make a RustC uh so >> here's a fun one. I think it's now</p>\n<p><strong>[69:24]</strong></p>\n<p>easier than ever to introduce a new protocol into the world if you ship a conformance suite. >> Yeah. >> Like release a conformance suite and boom, overnight you'll have libraries in half a dozen languages because the conformance suite is the majority of the work. >> Yeah. That interesting. Uh and then then you also make it when you when you do that you make it much more readily adoptable by other LLMs. you make it like it's like >> it overcomes the problem that it's not in the training data and people are kind of nervous that you could never launch a new program language now because it's not in the training data but the context</p>\n<p>lengths are big enough now that if you can get it into a test suite and fit the instru the examples on how to use it in 10,000 tokens doesn't matter that it's not in the training data >> yeah uh Ian we got you up here I and I probably should got you I if you have any one year or three years u but you know you've um you've got such a great track record um that We look to you as our Nostradamus. Uh maybe you just strongly agree with me that vibe coding is going out of alexon. But >> I um I >> I'll take that laugh. No, Adam, that</p>\n<p>laughter is noted. I That's derisive laughter. >> Yeah, >> I feel I feel like that the only way that V coding leaves the lexicon is if um the older generation makes the term uncool. So the younger generation comes up with a new term that is cooler than viping. >> What he's saying is you have a big lever. You have a big lever. >> I I've be I've done this before. I know how to It's like it it's like no. Isn't Come on, kids. Isn't that hella cringe? It's like dad. >> Um just watch just watch me vibe this</p>\n<p>up. I'm vibing right now. [laughter] >> That's right. I'm just like you guys. I'm just vibing this up. Okay, we need another term. We need another term for this guy. Don't don't kill my vibe. >> That's right. >> Um so I do have a few predictions. Uh on the one year um I have demand outstrips supply for Whimo rides from San Francisco airport. And the way that I measure that will be wait times greater than 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>>> Yeah. Interesting. That's a that's a great guess. That's a great prediction because Simon, you said this a couple years ago that the absolute cheapest tourist attraction in San Francisco is a Whimo. >> Oh yeah. >> So like 10 bucks you get to go in a self-driving [snorts] car. It's the best, >> right? It's like why wouldn't I wait 10 minutes for a Whimo? It's like I'm waiting. I'm you know I'm going to wait for 10 minutes for the Pirates of the Caribbean. Why would I not? >> I don't think it's worn off for me. It hasn't worn off. I've been riding Whimos for a year and a half. I still get that little like fion of glee when I get in a Whimo and it sets off on its own.</p>\n<p>>> Yeah. Well, and I actually saw I I was in the apparently it's pretty tight like cordon in the mission where the zuks are riding around and Yeah. And so I >> too. Yeah. >> Yeah. And I I was with the I was trying to get on the zuks, you know, I'm on the zuks weight list, but it is like you're it's enticing you like I want to actually I want to get in that. So Ian, great prediction. Is that a one-year</p>\n<p><strong>[72:24]</strong></p>\n<p>prediction, Ian, or was that what's the >> Yeah, that's a one-year prediction. Um cuz they should be launching Rise from SFO for the general public this year. >> Um I have a second one year prediction. >> Um >> so friend as in friend.com >> I think uh they will have under 10,000 activated devices at the end of the year. Um well under 10,000 but that's probably a conservative prediction. Um, when activated devices, someone has</p>\n<p>bought the thing and has actually sent at least one message to it. >> What is friend.com? >> Oh my. [laughter] >> Oh, what? Okay. Yeah. What? Go on. >> Okay. Brian Brian has not been to New York City this year. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Is that right? Oh, so campaign had a very large uh >> Oh, but before you before you explain it to me, Adam, I notic you've been a little bit quiet. Do you I I think Adam Adam also does not know what friend.com</p>\n<p>is and he's he is relieved that that I >> doing for forever. [laughter] No, no, I love >> I I I love friend.com and I use it the way that one conventionally uses it. [laughter] >> Just like normal. Just normal. >> Just like normal like all the other all the way you other folks use it. Anyway, go on. I'll let them explain how we all use it together. >> Tell tell father time [laughter] here how how you use this time. >> Tell tell Funny McDuddy Daddy how we actually how all the rest of us use</p>\n<p>this. [laughter] >> Well, this is great. We have a yes no on this one. [laughter] >> We do have a yes no. Yeah. So, tell me about friend.com. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, Friend.com had a large subway ad presence this year um in New York City, but also in Chicago and I think they did a campaign in LA. Um the New York City ad campaign was not wellreceived. Many of the advertisements [laughter] were defaced by the New York City</p>\n<p>public. um to the degree that there was there was a picture on I saw of someone went as the friend.com uh advertisement for Halloween. So they they printed up a a sweater of the friend.com advertisement and handed out Sharpies so people could deface their [laughter] Halloween costumes similar to the ads in the in the subway. >> Hey, you know what? I got to hand it to you, New York. This is a very Bay Area thing you all are doing out there.</p>\n<p>We're, you know, that's that's uh that's that's great. That is really terrific. Um, okay. So, what is So, all right. What is it? It's >> It is a It is a AI companion. It is a $129 pendant that has a microphone in it >> that connects to your phone</p>\n<p><strong>[75:25]</strong></p>\n<p>>> and it it uses the microphone that could have just been the microphone in your phone, but isn't for some reason. um to send messages to a AI companion which can respond to you by sending you uh I think I think it talks through the phone to you. So it is kind of AI chatbot psychosis as a service or something >> jewelry. That's all right. All right. So, this is like in the vein of the rabbit R2 or the humane pin and this is uh yet another AI</p>\n<p>wearable that sounds like it's and so you say destined for I I yeah I'm really sorry that I've not I didn't get a chance to enjoy this whole ride. Um but thank you Ian for uh so you say less than 10,000 devices. That's a three prediction. Okay, >> that's a one one year prediction, but yeah, we're not going to get to 10. I the the three year would be that I'm pretty sure this company is going to flame out, but >> the one year is that this ad campaign does not really move the needle for them as a company. Oh my god, that ad just And that's the kind of thing where it's</p>\n<p>like I know because I'm basically like a rule biter and when I am tempted to deface things, it's like when I'm tempted to like run over that that the the the security bots, those little cones that Whopper that that that Samsung had that would run around and beep at you. I'm like, you know, I think that I want to throw you into the ditch means that you are I mean, it's like this is this is bad news for you. >> Well, this is Brian why I think you claiming that this is like the what something this would never happen in the Bay Area. Bay Area people are rule followers to a much greater degree. [laughter] Oh yeah.</p>\n<p>>> This is a New York phenomenon. >> Oh [clears throat] yeah. Yeah. No, no. I like I I I love the I love the rebellion here. Um and then Ian, do you have uh do you have some three years here? >> Yeah. So for the three-year uh I was thinking about the um Windows 10 end of life and the claims of uh the year of the Linux desktop. Um, and my three-year prediction is kind of an anti on that where uh the prediction is Windows is still above 90% on the Steam hardware</p>\n<p>survey as of December 2028. >> Okay. [laughter] Uh, and that that that's a good one. Um, or or a grimlin. I'm not sure. That's Are you counting that as utopian or dystopian? I think it's uh >> I think that it's Well, here here's the thing. I think that Linux has gone from less than 1% to over 3% on the Steam hardware survey in the previous 6 years driven largely in part by Steam first</p>\n<p>party hardware. So the Steam Deck uh in particular, but also you know just Linux usage in general has gone up. Um I think the Linux usage is going to go up in the next three years. Um but I still think that Windows is going to remain pretty dominant within that um hardware survey.</p>\n<p><strong>[78:28]</strong></p>\n<p>>> Uh so it means that like they may go from 95 to like 92 or something and and and Linux is going to grow up to about 5%. But I I suspect that the people who think that people are going to go out and replace their Windows 10 devices with a Linux machine or install Linux on their existing device to avoid buying a new device are kind of a little optimistic about how much work people want to put into their computing. >> I mean, can you imagine going back in</p>\n<p>the time machine and being like, \"Oh, this is a year of the Linux desktop, pal. We're going to have computers writing software in production before we have that. Sorry, we are this is uh I although I have you I have tried to use chat GBT and LLM more generally on uh Linux audio problems. What's interesting is that it's actually not that helpful. Um that it's the I mean they tell you the things that you know whatever it's it's Linux audio is still undefeated is what I'd like to say. Part of the part of the real struggle here is the kernel level antiche which is like basically necessary for some genres of game that</p>\n<p>will just never happen with Linux. And so that's like I don't know some of this is about like the relative market size of those markets versus other ones but like there's some game like I will never not use Windows because all the games I want to play effectively require colonel level of anti-che to run and so it just they're not going to ever work on Linux. Um, the Hey, Adam, you know, this podcast has really really arrived because my 13-year-old daughter is texting me predictions that she has during the episode. Wow. >> I I she and you know,</p>\n<p>>> our whole demographic in so many ways. >> This apple didn't fall far from the tree. She thinks this is going to be a major scandal involving Apple in the next three years. So, I you know, don't ask any follow-up questions. She also said that that she thought that the Open AI guy was going to go to jail. She told me and I'm like, \"Sam Alman?\" She's like, \"I don't know who that is.\" I'm like, \"That's the open AI guy. That's the that's who you is gonna go.\" [laughter] So, sure. Uh Sam Alman, if you're listening to this, please send us a cease and assist because we have that as a goal for this year. Uh okay, let's go</p>\n<p>on to uh six years. Are we ready for some six years here? Um >> yeah. >> Uh Simon, what do you got for us? >> I've just got the one. I think the act of the the the job of being paid money to type code into a computer Yeah. will go the same way as punching punch cards. >> Okay. >> I do I think in six years time I do not think it will anyone will be paid to just do the thing where you type the code. >> Just type the code. Okay. >> I think software engineering will still be an enormous career. I just think the</p>\n<p>software engineers won't be spending multiple hours of their day in a text editor typing out syntax. >> It will look like punching cards. I think so. Yeah. >> Yeah. Interesting. In uh in six years. Um and but software engineering still very much exists. >> I believe so. I I hope so. [laughter] I very much hope so because I think the um the challenge of being a software engineer is not remembering how if what what if what for loops look like. It is understanding what computers can do and</p>\n<p><strong>[81:29]</strong></p>\n<p>how to turn fuzzy human requirements into actual like working software. And that's that's what we're for. And I think we'll still be doing that just a lot more of it in a lot more ambitious scale. >> And then Okay. Do you Does the software engineer though deals with code? I mean they I mean the code is being written. >> I think they probably look at it occasionally. >> Okay. Only occasionally a little bit. So I met >> Who debugs it? >> Um I I hate to say it, the agents debug it themselves. >> Okay. Who debugs your device driver that either works or doesn't? I like working</p>\n<p>on this programming language like I'm doing my own codegen and like claude is happy to pull out GDB and just like debug the programs that it generates and why the like like the binary is wrong and then back fill that into why the compiler is wrong like it's better than I am frankly >> this is more about me than anything else but like it's a thing that it can do now >> I mean this is a really interesting thing I've been seeing just in the past three months around coding agents is that four months ago I was absolutely on team you cannot commit a line of code that you've not read reviewed and understood that these things have written for you that's it's irresponsible to do that. I'm edging</p>\n<p>away from that a little bit because it turns out the art of using these as effectively is get them to prove to you that the thing they have written has worked. The same way as like when you're working in a company, you don't review every line of code that another team has written, your team depends on, but you do talk to that team and you make sure that they are making a convincing case that the code works well and they've tested and they've covered the bases and so forth. It's a similar kind of thing and it's so uncomfortable like >> it is. I I it is beginning to give me the early onset of what they what they call deep blue.</p>\n<p>[laughter] >> Yes. >> Um so but I mean you cheered me up at the end there that that there's uh that there is there's still a role for software engineers. Um um Adam, do you have a do you have a six year? >> Yeah, I have a couple. Uh you dovetailing on your daughter's prediction, I predict that the the cell phone uh business is drying up uh because people are keeping their devices longer. So Apple has several new attempts for what the next flagship</p>\n<p>thing is going to be. >> Oh man, that is a good prediction. >> Oh, that's that's interesting. I have like almost the opposite prediction [laughter] already written down here. I had phones remain the most popular form factor for personal computers in terms of units sold in the trailing 12 months. >> Huh. Because yeah, I but I do think this longevity thing is a real real real issue that these I mean you've already begun to see this where people are like why am I getting the latest iPhone again? Like the camera's already awesome</p>\n<p>and I actually I care more about battery life. I care about like is it waterproof? I mean I care about other things that So all right. So Adam, how does this the Um, I guess this does this happen after the major scandal in the next three years. I don't know. >> Terrific. It must be on the heels of that scandal. Yes. [laughter] >> Or or maybe the maybe the scandal maybe this somehow wrapped up in the scandal. Maybe the scandal is that they are they're scandalously entering a new</p>\n<p><strong>[84:30]</strong></p>\n<p>business or what have you. >> No, I think that that it's got Apple and but Apple's got a ton of capital, so they could go um you know, they could >> they could do a bunch more Apple Vision Pros. >> Yeah. Uh well, they Yeah. So, Ian, do you feel that because you say this is on devices sold is still good. So, you think that the phones are going to still find ways to differentiate or >> I just I just think that there's >> that I kind of have the opposite view in that I I think that um I think the phone sales may not go up,</p>\n<p>but they're still just going to dominate in terms of units sold. And there's no other form factor that has emerged that is more popular as a um personal computing device. >> Yeah, I don't I don't think those are incompatible, Ian. I think what I think uh you know, phones going down, >> it still could be the most popular um form factor and folks could be desperately Apple in particular desperately trying to figure out what the next thing is going to be. Okay. Could I tag a prediction onto that which</p>\n<p>is that if phones are not the most popular form factor, I think it's going to be the Neural Link device of some sort. >> Oh, here we go. Uh uh you [laughter] neural link in in six years. Is this how? >> No, I don't think it's going to happen. I But if phones, if not phones, >> phones and if not phones, it has to be that >> because all of the other form factors, the little bracelets and things you talk to, that's all garbage. Nobody wants to talk out loud to their computer in public, >> right? >> But if you can think to your computer in public, that's the thing that could</p>\n<p>knock the phone off its pedestal. >> And it will be the leadership of the pope of the papacy that that that tells us that we get with the the leading the way with the neural implant. Okay. Interesting. >> Is a curse curse prediction that's a mixture of all of these, which is of course appleacquiresfriend.com [laughter] >> and and it's less than 10,000 devices. Um >> I have a a second device prediction for six year which was um I predict that more Macs are sold in the trailing 12</p>\n<p>months than any smart glasses or AI companion devices >> this in the trailing of six years. So in five years you got more Macs than anything else than then. >> Yeah. So it's like when when the six years is up we look back in the previous 12 months >> it's like hey it's all laptops. It's it's laptops and phones. It's the same. >> I'm Yeah, I'm saying that that laptops Well, specifically Macs. So, it's not actually laptops. It's the Mac line because I think that's the only thing that you can get number of units on</p>\n<p>roughly. Um, but I think that more of those are going to get sold than any smart glasses or AI companion devices. And I'm saying Max specifically like I think that you know laptops is definitely going to be is bigger than Macs. I'm saying that like these smart</p>\n<p><strong>[87:30]</strong></p>\n<p>glasses and AI companion devices are just not um a real volume seller at all. >> Yeah, I to any like real degree. >> Yeah, I I totally agree with that. Um, so, um, I'm going to say that the, um, the the DSM adds LLM as a contributing factor to psychosis. The same way the DSM treats LLM the way it treats kind of like cocaine. >> Um, where um, you can have >> a lot in the early days of the</p>\n<p>profession and then looked back as a mistake of having [laughter] >> Well, no, because I think I mean we are just you said the lobsters issue uh, earlier. I think that we are we are going to have a an increasing number of incidents of LLMs uh resulting in psychotic behavior. >> Okay. Has the DSM got anything about social media in right now today? So, so right now they do have um the on like internet gaming for example and they um but I think this is going to be more</p>\n<p>this is going to be faster than internet gaming because I think that where gaming is um looking more at at social isolation and and and some kind of modum of dependency versus like no you like the the the LLM got you to do something that you would not have otherwise done that you had this delusion that that that you know your that your mother that that that your mother was involved in a global conspiracy. Um it to and and you burned down your house. >> You're betting against the AI labs being able to tamp this stuff under which I</p>\n<p>think is a fair bet. >> I I think it's well it's more that I'm like I'm just betting I'm just betting on crazy um in that like I think that that like you you can't there's no amount of safety that you can put in place that allows these things to be used and not I'm not I don't know they will be liable. I think it's going to be more like for diagnosticians to be aware of like hey if you're talking to a patient like do they have this kind of idea because of the LLM have they been having conversations with their LLM about this? >> I mean it feels like we need this today. >> Oh no I think we do. I think that this I think that the reason I was saying</p>\n<p>earlier at the top I was struggling with sixear predictions. The DSM moves slowly. So that's why I that's why this is a six-year prediction and not a one-year prediction. >> And this is well beyond deep blue at this point. >> This is this is well beyond deep blue. That's that's exactly well no because this is not like a feeling of on we >> I got it delusion this is a delusion this is a psychosis thing and I again we we have already seen this um we and I think we will uh and it's an accelerant it's like it's like substance abuse you</p>\n<p>got people that can have a that can use substances without actually developing this kind of psychosis and then others that that develop a real psychosis around it and I think that see uh the DSM become aware of that um so I I think you will also have um you will have I think actually in three years but certainly in six you're going to have people trying to use as a legal defense. The LLM made me do it. I not blaming the actual frontier model. I'm actually it's the the LLM that that did jin me up and</p>\n<p><strong>[90:32]</strong></p>\n<p>talked me into doing this um this doing this this illegal act um whatever it might be. >> Are they also going to use it for for stock buyers? Are they going to be like the LLM told me to buy the stock? I didn't use any insider information to be able to to trade on. >> Absolutely. Absolutely. The this is you know the the kitty did it is what the you with the with the you know when you got the toddlers the everyone blaming the LM. No, absolutely. The LM told me to buy the stock. Um oh actually uh I shoot I forgot one of my three years. Um I do think um ads are going to enter LLMs. Um I I and I think that you're um</p>\n<p>and I think it's going to be an issue um where we >> like product placement be like you know what would go great with this recipe is a Coca-Cola >> I I think um product placement and where you are actually either putting your thumb on the scale of what of the output or getting more of the input. So the it cuz I mean you think about like the view that these chat bots have on the kinds of questions that we're asking and boy if you were developing you know if you</p>\n<p>were in marketing or you're developing a product wouldn't you love to know what people are searching and it feels like it's like that's something you would pay for and it's something that you know it's like I think these guys will sell it to you and post the AI bust that I'm predicting roughly in three years. So you know all my all my predictions try to hang together. >> Chat GPT knows when you're pregnant because you tell me. >> Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. the old adage of like I think it was like Target, right? That famously knew >> famously apparently that wasn't real. The thing that [laughter] Target guessed someone was pregnant from their purchasing habits. Apparently that doesn't hold up.</p>\n<p>>> That makes Yes, that that's a relief because that didn't make that kind of didn't pass the smell test at the time. So, um, and then are you saying that like the chat GBT equivalents are going to integrate ads as a first party or are you taking a like SEO black hat view of like people are going to work out how to uh get their data into the training data such that when someone asks what the best laundry detergent is, then it the the the</p>\n<p>uh model will spit like, oh, it's definitely tied and you should not use any other brand. >> I I was not predicting the latter, but I think the ladder is a great prediction. So, I I think that they I I strongly concur with the latter, but I think that we're I think there's going to be a need like there going to be other kind of commercial vectors here, not some of which uh ultimately it's going to be ads at some level. It's going to be getting you to buy product. Um the Adam, did you have other other six years? >> Yes, I think you're going to like this one too, even though it sounds insane as I read it. Uh, I think Tesla is going to</p>\n<p>be out of the consumer car business. I think they're going to be selling batteries. I think they're going to be selling fleets, but I think that they are not going to be selling to individuals. And and their numbers are like down year-over-year for the last two or three years. >> Uh, and I think that's going to continue. >> Um, do they sell whatever the plural of Optimus is? Is that Optimi? What is the plural of Optimus? The Tesla bots. Are</p>\n<p><strong>[93:34]</strong></p>\n<p>is that does that ever come to fruition? Is that what they sell? >> Oh, uh, sure. Yes, it's [laughter] it's it's >> it's Yes, it's theirfriend.com. >> It's their friend.com. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. But >> yeah, I love I I love this prediction. Obviously, battery I mean batteries is already a big part of their business and arguably the cars are batteries and then uh and fleets. >> And fleets. Okay. So, they are out of the consumer car business. >> Yep. >> Um I do love that one. Um um I'm going to add that um Nvidia's uh peak valuation in six years we will see</p>\n<p>was in 2025. >> So I I I I think we are past Nvidia. This is not stock. This is not investment advice. Although [laughter] although this one is definitely if you think it is investment advice and you act on it, if you could please send us a cease and desist, we'd appreciate it. Um, exactly. If you're listening to this, please put all your money into shorting Nvidia. >> That's right. Um, I um I think that and this is not a slight on Nvidia. I think that the valuation is it it like it's simply uh too high. Um, and the too much</p>\n<p>competition, too much that there are too many. I mean, we talked about Gemini last year and I mean, Gemini not trained on Nvidia GPUs. I just think there's that there's just too much out there that too many headwinds ultimately for them for for that valuation. I think absolutely a going concern um and a well executing business. But >> this dubtales into one of my predictions too and maybe justifies it. But I say in six years Jensen hands over the reigns at Nvidia and to a successor CEO maybe on the on the back of the the dwindling stock.</p>\n<p>>> Uh and is that CEO Pat Gellzinger? [laughter] >> No. I think he's he's focused on his faith-based startup. >> It's his faith-based uh LOM startup. Yeah. >> Yeah. Um >> I mean he'll be like 68 or 69 in Jensen. Yeah. >> Is that right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean >> almost 70y old man who has infinite wealth decides to retire does not seem >> sure. Okay. Bet against it. That's that's fine. But uh but but look at like</p>\n<p>Morris Chang who at age I don't even know is still going strong. So >> or Larry Ellison. Uh yeah or >> yeah I was gonna go Pier Lemon but yeah Larry Ellison fine the latest podcast. [laughter] >> Um all right [snorts] um the uh Steve did you have any six years? >> My my sixth year is boring but it's funny because it shouldn't be boring is which is AI will not have will have not caused the total collapse of our economic and governmental systems.</p>\n<p>>> Like you know that's a very optimistic prediction. That's great. >> Yeah. Yeah. I I'm choosing to be optimistic here. Uh I think anyway I mean I I you know there's some ways in which that could be a pessimism and not an optimism but I'm I'm gonna say that humanities could be okay. >> You didn't predict that economic collapse wouldn't happen. You</p>\n<p><strong>[96:35]</strong></p>\n<p>specifically said that LLMs are not going to happen by AI. Yes. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think we're gonna figure it out. And I think that a lot of the anxiety uh right now and worry about it is anxiety and worry and humanity is resilience and change is going to happen. But we'll we'll be okay. It's going to be fine. >> And this is the affirmation tape that you listen to when you're beginning to suffer from deep blue. This is the you Steve Clavnik reads. This is you put your headset on as you're going to sleep. And every >> had a very optimistic 2025 and so I think I'm going to try to I'm trying to</p>\n<p>continue that into the future. We'll see. That's a That is great. Um Adam, do you have any other six years or are we going to end on the optimistic note? >> Let's end on the optimistic note. >> Yeah, [laughter] translation. I I do have another six year, but it was way too grim. Um what's good? I think that you know I I I think we you know the a common theme from this year I would say is uh the LMS really transitioning into a useful tool into the hands of practitioners. I think that they um that and the demise of friend.com. um I I would say are the are</p>\n<p>are the two big themes >> and and the rise of the Capot. >> Absolutely. I'm going to go check out the parrot. I'm going to go check out the parrot. Um as long if I learn that the parrot survive coding though, I'm going to be very upset because that's going to run contrary to my to my one-year prediction. All right. Well, uh this has been great. Um thank you all for uh for for joining us. If you do have predictions and you and I'm actually going to um the um Mike Caparella joined us last year. who could not join us this year. Um, Adam and, uh, sent me some of his predictions. So, I'm</p>\n<p>going to drop those into the chat. So, we've got those on the record. Um, if you do have any predictions, get those in the record. Um, and we'll have PRs open as well. You can get PRs in there. Um, but um, we thank you all for your predictions. We've said before predictions tell us much more about the present, we think, than about the future. Um, but I don't know, maybe these will maybe maybe this year is the exception. Um, and we're gonna we're gonna learn learn a lot more about the about the future. I do think deep blue has got I mean [laughter] it's it's very good, Adam. I mean, it's really</p>\n<p>>> Yeah, >> it's got if people have predictions uh whether you're listening live right now or on YouTube or on the podcast. Uh if you go to the show notes on GitHub, uh if you want to drop your predictions in, uh it'll give us an opportunity to review them in 1, three, and six years. So, feel free to submit a PR. >> Awesome. Thanks everybody and here's to a great and hopeful 2026.</p>", "cleanup_applied": false, "cleanup_reason": "legacy_or_disabled"}
