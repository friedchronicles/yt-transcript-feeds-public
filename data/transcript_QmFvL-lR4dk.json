Violation of the IOC&#x27;s rules on political statements. Um I was really bummed. I always am bummed when stuff like this happens, especially when it&#x27;s so black and white as to who the good guys and the bad guys are. and it doesn&#x27;t seem like a political statement to honor people who have been killed. Um, but do you think it&#x27;s a bad move for the Olympics to</p>\n<p>legislate on something like this? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t get how the Olympics can say that this is a bad political statement or whatnot when they banned Russia from competing. Is that not the same thing? Like the Olympics did that, right? Like they banned Russia. They said that you can&#x27;t compete under a Russian flag.
