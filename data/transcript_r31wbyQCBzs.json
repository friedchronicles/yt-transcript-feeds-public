I&#x27;m going to answer the question. &gt;&gt; And I told you about that, Attorney General before you started. &gt;&gt; You don&#x27;t tell me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I did tell you because we saw what you did in the Senate. &gt;&gt; Lawyer, not even a lawyer. &gt;&gt; This is not a game, Secretary. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m attorney general. My apologies. I couldn&#x27;t tell. So, I was on an airplane while this hearing was going on and consuming these clips from the sky. And I feel like if anyone was watching my face, like they would never figure out that I was</p>\n<p>watching a hearing cuz I thought it was like some insane movie where I was like, &quot;Oh, no, she didn&#x27;t.&quot; And then like, &quot;Oh, is that really happening?&quot; And then almost crying when she wouldn&#x27;t even turn to look at the survivors, which seems like the lowest level of basic decency. What were your big takeaways? Number one, she didn&#x27;t answer a single question about the Epstein files or really anything that Democrats threw her way. I think number two, and people may be mad at me for this, but I thought that the Democratic plan going into it was horrible. Yes, you have a very combative witness, but also like do better in terms of cross-examining her.</p>\n<p>The real losers in the hearing are the survivors. Those are the ones who lost.</p>", "chapters_count": 0}
