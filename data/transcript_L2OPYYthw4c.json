I remember him distinctly\nsaying this in the '90s, he said, \"There's only\none category in software. It's called information management. You got to schematize people, places and things, and that's it.\" The problem is people are messy. Do people have loyalty to a model or do they have loyalty to an AI brand? You want an ensemble of models. You have agents\nintermediating that ensemble so that it meets your needs. Will everyone's preference not just be for more intelligence? Like, I'll go into the picker and manually select o3 for like, \"Where should I\ngo get ice cream,\" query? It's like a rite of passage\nfor certain software companies</p>\n<p>to try to take on Excel. Why is it so durable? We sort of don't give it enough credit. It's like, \"I can make it do anything.\"\nI think the world's most approachable programming environment. 100%. And Pieter here is who? Pieter is Pieter Levels. He's like an indie\u2014\nOh, yes, I know him. Yeah, you know Pieter Levels. I know him, yeah.\nCourse yes. You're so online. See, Satya knows who Pieter Levels is. This is why Microsoft is\nlike an $14 trillion company. Was there anything good\nto see at the data center? Or is like\u2014\nThere's always\u2014 \"That's a lot of racks.\"</p>\n<p>It's the most fun place to go, man. Yeah. Satya Nadella took over\nas Microsoft CEO in 2014, but he's been with the company for more than 30 years and has seen a lot. Microsoft has grown by 10X in the time that Satya\nhas been running it. And he's credited with Microsoft's success first in cloud and now in the AI boom. Cheers, John. This is great. So what should people be\nexcited about at Ignite? The Ignite Conference for\nus, more than anything else, is about making sure that\nAI is getting diffused inside of the enterprise, right?</p>\n<p>I mean, if there is one thing, it's more about, hey, what does it mean not to just admire somebody\nelse's AI factory or AI agent, but how to build your own AI factory. So organizing the data layer turns out to be probably\nthe most complicated thing, which spans the enterprise such that it can meet the intelligence. And so that's the stuff that I think we'll probably do a lot of. We still don't really have Deep Research in a corporate context. We do, that's what Copilot is about. But most people day-to-day\ndo not have this.</p>\n<p>So are they just\nunderusing AI that exists? Yes, and in fact, it's\ninteresting you brought that up because to me that is the\nkiller feature, right? So the biggest thing we\ndid was we took this graph that is underneath what is what I think is the most important database\nin any company, right, which is underneath your email, your documents, your Teams\ncalls, what have you. It's the relationships that... By the way, people are not\nworking in an ad hoc fashion in an unstructured way, but you know,</p>\n<p>they're all doing it in\nrelation of some business event. Yes. That semantic connection is in people's heads and it's lost. And for the first time, there's much better recall of that. Why do you think this is underpenetrated than the enterprise? Because I feel like people\nare using lots of, you know, LLM tools. They are uploading\nindividual documents maybe,</p>\n<p><strong>[03:02]</strong></p>\n<p>but I don't think most companies have the all singing, all dancing, all of the company's context is plugged into their everyday AI. Yeah, in fact, I would say\nthere are two sets of things. One, it's starting, right? I mean, you know, what I always say, at least compared to anything we have done in terms of all the office\nsuites over our history, this is the fastest in that sense, because it's change management, right? At the end of the day,\nyou've got to get it in, people have to use it. Oh, by the way, in the enterprise setting, it has got to mean all\nthe discovery has to work. All of the data governance has to work.</p>\n<p>We have had to plumb\nthis purview into Copilot such that anytime I'm\ntrying to retrieve something that's confidential, it's\nlabeled confidential, it's IRM'd and so on. So there's been\nsignificant amount of work, and that I think is where we're\nstarting to see the uplift. The other thing I'd say is, you know, it's one thing to have it work across the Microsoft 365 graph, right? But then the next thing is,\noh, what about your ERP system? The connectors kind of work, but they don't really because they're two thin straws, right?</p>\n<p>You just need a much\nbetter data architecture where you have to essentially\nsemantically embed all of these into one layer. Okay. There's been a vision for decades of your company's data at your fingertips. My favorite example of this is I read like the book\n\"Softwar\" on, you know, the history of Oracle, and it talks about Larry\nEllison doing EBCs, I think they're talking about\none in Japan, in the 1990s. So it's the late 1990s. And he is pitching executives</p>\n<p>on all your company's data in one place. Part of the reason this\nis an evergreen pitch is because companies don't actually have all their data at their fingertips. Companies do not eat their\ndata infrastructure vegetables. And, you know, the pitch\nto executives is always, \"You can go answer your questions yourself at the touch of a button,\" as opposed to sending\na request to an analyst who goes and does an\ninvestigation for you. Will we finally this time\neat our data plumbing? You can push back on the\npremise, but that's my question. No, I think that, in fact, I\nthink, if I'm not mistaken, Bill coined this term,\ninformation at your fingertips,</p>\n<p>at a COMDEX speech, I think in the '90s. I think that's right, yeah. And that is kind of where it, you know, and for the longest time,\nBill was always obsessed about, like, he felt, in fact, I remember him distinctly\nsaying this in the '90s, which I picked up in one\nof the reviews I was in as a junior guy sitting around, and he said, \"There's only\none category in software. It's called information management. You got to schematize\npeople, places and things, and that's it. You don't have to do anything anymore because all software...\" And that was the dream Bill always had, which is he wanted, like for\nexample, he hated file systems</p>\n<p>because they were unstructured. He would've loved it if\neverything was a SQL database and he could just do SQL queries and program against all information. Like, that to him was\nlike a elegant solution to information at your fingertips. The problem is people are messy, and even if data is structured, it sort of is not truly\navailable in one index, right, or one SQL query that I can\nrun against all of that.</p>\n<p><strong>[06:04]</strong></p>\n<p>So that has been the fundamental challenge of the old world, I would say. I would've not thought, none of us thought that somehow this AI thing and a deep neural network at some scaling will suddenly become the thing that figures out the patterns, right? Not some schematized data model, right? In fact, for the longest time we used to always obsess\nabout, oh, how complex do the relationships have to be, or the data model needs to be to capture the essence\nof an enterprise, right? And it turns out it's lots of parameters</p>\n<p>in a neural network with\na lot of compute power. Dwarkesh talks about this\nreally smart remote employee who started five minutes\nago, getting at the point that the models can be arbitrarily smart and they can do RAG and\nthey can have access to everything in your enterprise, but it's not quite the same as the model actually\nknowing something as a model. And so the models, unless\nyou train custom models inside your company,\ncannot actually get smarter at what it is that you do and, you know, the thousandth query is not\nany smarter than the first. Where do you think that goes?</p>\n<p>I think there're two things there, I mean, I think if I understand his thing, it's all about in context learning or continual learning, right? I mean, that's sort of the ultimate thing. And it sort of speaks to\nthe thing I was saying, which is if you kind of have\nthe models cognitive core separated from its knowledge, then you have essentially the\ncontinual learning, you know, formula, so to speak, or the algorithm, and then you just unleash it. At least there are three things to me that are outside of the model at runtime that I think you kind\nof have to crack, right?</p>\n<p>One is memory, and all\nforms of memory, right? Short, long, right? Even like these big\nchallenges of, you know, humans are great at long-term\ncredit assignment, right? Which is how does intuitively,\nlike somebody said to me, \"Hey, the day, you know, AI models can both reward and remember that you, you know, how to punish for some mistake because\nthey have the ability to do long-term credit assignment, that's when you'll know\nthat you have real memory.\" But in any case, memory is one.</p>\n<p>The second one is entitlements, right? So, which is they have to really respect all of the permissioning\nsystem at runtime, right? Because this is where we put their roles, what access do I have, and so the model needs to meet that. And then the action space all has to work. So if you bring those three things, because after all, that's the environment. So if I have actions,\nentitlements, and memory with these models, and they by definition have to be outside of the model, but be built into the model.</p>\n<p>And so for example, in Copilot today, you use OpenAI models, you use even Claude, right? I need the system to work\nacross both of those. And that I think is where\nthe frontier has to move to. Yes, yes. I have many more AI questions, but I want to ask you some questions about your way of working. So, what does your day-to-day look like? And in particular, how are you\nmanaging by walking around?</p>\n<p><strong>[09:05]</strong></p>\n<p>What virtual corridors are you wandering, to just get a sense for\nwhat's going on in Microsoft? What do your customer\nengagements actually look like? Just for a normal day, not earnings or not a board meeting or something. Interestingly enough, my normal day, it's the two ends of it, right? Which is the customer stuff, so there's not a day that I\nwould say I'm not having... Many of them are remote. I mean, there's Teams calls\nfor me most of the day, at least two or three of\nthem with some customer. It's sort of the most helpful way for me to stay most grounded, I would say.</p>\n<p>So I have at least one\nor two of those each day. And then I would say there is a lot of meeting time. You know, as a CEO, one of\nthe things I've recognized is there are two types of meetings, right? One meeting is where I'm\njust supposed to convene and, you know, keep my mouth shut because convening was\nthe real thing, right? It is like, don't over\nperform and just sit, because all the work\nwould've either happened or will happen after.</p>\n<p>So that's kind of one. And then the other meeting,\nwhich are the important meetings where I do need to learn or\nI need to make a decision or communicate something. So meetings is another spot. Then I must say, it's kind\nof like all over for me, Teams channels, right? I am lingering around Teams channels and they're most helpful. In fact, if anything,\nI learn the most there, I meet most people that... So wandering the halls, I wish I could tell you that, you know, that is the form.</p>\n<p>No, but I think Teams is the new wandering the\nhalls, right, you know, lurking around those channels. 100%, and then I meet... So the most beautiful thing is for me to be able to... That's where I make the\nmost connections, right? I get to know, wow, here's the person working on Excel agent, or that's the eval that they're looking... I mean, I learn so much out of it than anything else I've done. So are Teams at Microsoft just working away on their product and then Satya pops up and, you know, has a question on their product? Some of it, like, I wish\u2014 They give a little yelp.\nI wish\u2014 Yeah, well, I wish, you know, sometimes I feel like we are\nway too permissioned too.</p>\n<p>You know, I wish I had\nmore access sometimes. In fact, my biggest complaint is that I can't drop in\neverywhere I want to. But, yes, it's fun to be\nable to just go in there and it sort of normalizes it. And then people are also,\nlike today's workforce is not shy of sharing\ntheir opinion with you. I've noticed, yeah. You are famous, at least in\nsmall corners of the valley, speaking of being methodical,\nfor staying very connected to what's going on in tech here.</p>\n<p>And I remember you came and\nvisited the Stripe office. Remember that one in the Mission, yeah, when we were a pip-squeak company. I mean, it was probably right after you took over\nas CEO, I'm guessing. But Stripe was very small\nand Microsoft was very big. Actually before, I think the first time\nI came to your offices was when I was running Azure first. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so it was even before that. So that would've been very\nearly in Stripe's journey.</p>\n<p><strong>[12:07]</strong></p>\n<p>Why do you think you do this\nmuch more than most other CEOs? Because other CEOs should want\nto meet all the startups too. I've always grown up, in\nsome sense, I grew up, even in a Microsoft, which had... I have that developer relations evangelism sort of gene in me, I kind of approach, I think a lot of it as, hey, if you don't follow developers... There are two sort of things\nthat are ingrained in me. One is if you don't follow\nwhere developers are going, it's hard to sort of be relevant\nin terms of tech platforms. And then you really need to\nunderstand the new workload</p>\n<p>in order to build a tech platform. Those are the two things\nthat at least I've kept. And so therefore, the only way, if you're not following\nstartups, it's very hard to know what is either the\nplatform or the workload. So that's sort of a thing\nthat I've indexed towards. The other thing is it's just, you know, I derive so much energy out of it, right? I mean, I've always thought founders are just magical people who create something from nothing. I mean, it's just sort of\nfeels like a magic trick. So I always like, \"How the\nheck does one do that?\" Yeah, no, it is funny you say that about following what\nthe startups are doing.</p>\n<p>We always conceived of\nwhat Stripe was building as it was important to build for startups both because today's small startups are tomorrow's public companies. And we've seen that again\nand again on Stripe. But we just felt at an intuitive level and we felt this before we could prove it, that what the startups were interested in were often better product experiences. And so if the startups want stablecoins or usage based billing or what have you, we should build for those needs.</p>\n<p>Not just 'cause we'll have\na good startup business, but the enterprises will come around. And it took us, I would say, many years to kind of prove out that model. But now we're really seeing\u2014 Yeah, in fact, I think you guys are a bit of a gold standard on that. In fact, one of the things\nthat I learned from you guys was rediscovering at some level what Microsoft was very good at, which is following the developer, being where the startups are. And so that's what sort\nof led me even to GitHub and NAT and all of the rest, which is to some degree\nthe GitHub asset, right? Obviously it is a great asset.</p>\n<p>We needed to, one, be good stewards of an open source ecosystem. But it also the place where every startup, like the one thing that\neverybody does have is their repos in GitHub. And I felt like, hey, being in that loop was important for us. Not just \"oh it's strategically great to have some position\nthere,\" to learn simply and to build better product,\nI think, is sort of well said. Because you lose sometimes the aesthetic of what is required, what's that friction-free way to deliver</p>\n<p>because the least amount\nof patience is there and the time to value, for\nexample, has to be maximized. Is Microsoft thinking about generated UIs that are personalized to... Like, when you think about it, software is stuck in the\nold paradigm of, you know, we write a bunch of software\nand it goes to Gold Master and as you know, goes out on discs and now that same kind of software, it's delivered in the cloud,</p>\n<p><strong>[15:07]</strong></p>\n<p>but the UI you want is probably, you know, we can render that exact UI in real time. Is that a direction you guys are going? I think that, for sure, like at some level what's happening is on one\nside our ability to generate. I mean, if you sort of say\nyou can generate all code, so therefore you can\ngenerate some UX scaffolding around anything that's a\nlot more custom, right? So especially, in fact\nfor the longest time, one of the things at Microsoft was what's the difference\nbetween a document, a website and an application, really? And so, to some degree, yeah, exactly.</p>\n<p>So you can generate any one of those at any time depending on what\nformat you want to present it. But, interestingly enough for all the talk of, hey, all these apps go. Take even our good old IDEs, in some sense IDEs are back, right? Whether it's Excel or VS Code. Because the reality is\nAI generates output, I need to make sense of that output. In fact, I need a fantastic editor</p>\n<p>that lets me do diffs and\niterations on it with AI. So I think the IDE, I think in fact one of the most exciting things is new classes of highly refined IDEs that have even a sort of a telemetry loop with the intelligence layer, but also they kind of act more like\nheads up displays, right? I have thousands of agents going off. How am I going to make sense of the micro steering\nof thousands of agents. And that is what IDEs/inboxes</p>\n<p>and messaging tools will be, right? Which is, I'm not messaging one, you know, or dealing with triage the\nway I deal with it today, but it's going to be different. Okay, interesting. So you think right now programmers spend all\ntheir time in an IDE, but they're one of the few\nprofessions that does that. And your vision is the accountant IDE, the lawyer IDE, and\u2014 What is the metaphor of how I will work with agents, right? So it's kind of like massive\nmacro delegation, right? So there's lots of agents I go give a bunch of\ninstructions to and they go off and work sometimes for hours,\ndays, let's say, you know,</p>\n<p>as the models get better,\nbut they are checking in and so it's macro\ndelegation, micro steering. So if you take that, how does one do micro\nsteering with context, right? It can't come back like my... It can't be in the next\nnotification hell, right? Which is, it sort of notifies me. It has like five words. I don't know exactly\nwhat the real context is or what have you. That I think is where, and that has to be multi app like, right? So that's where I feel\nlike all software finally, when it grows up, it looks like an inbox</p>\n<p>and a messaging tool and a canvas with a blinking screen. Except this time around a\nlot of work got, you know, went and happened. Is that one app, is\nthat 10 different apps? Like, it's kind of interesting if you think about the\nproductivity suite that emerged, there was, you know, three big apps in Word,\nExcel, and PowerPoint.</p>\n<p><strong>[18:09]</strong></p>\n<p>But it's interesting that that number was not 1 and was not 40, it was 3. And so how do you think about this in the\u2014 I think that that's right. I mean, to me, it will be a few, I think. And in fact, the reductionist, you know, in me, it says, \"Man,\nthey'll be the same things.\" Except the job they do\nis going to be different because I think, you know, a table, at least at\nthe human level, right? Because we can all talk about, like what tools will agents use to communicate with each other, right? That's a different thing, right? Right now for the RL loop,</p>\n<p>they are simulating our\nproduction environment, but they will ultimately be more efficient in creating their own\nproduction environments to kind of RL themselves, so... But let's just leave that aside. But in order to communicate with us, I feel like we have discovered some good things that we like. We like spreadsheets and tables and we like documents\nin sort of linear form. We like inboxes or messaging tools. So these are like reasonable UIs, except the question I think you asked</p>\n<p>is how does this thing\nhave, when it shows up in an IDE with like a set of changes, you have to help me more\nthan just say, \"Okay, now here is a file, go to that file.\" Like, that directed plan,\nnot just to execute, but for me to do my workflow. And like, one of the things that we are experimenting with is mission control and\nGitHub Copilot is that. The idea is you go have\nfive, six different branches in which you fire off all\nthese autonomous agents. They all do their work, they come back</p>\n<p>and then your ability to do PR triage is where I think the next IDE is born. I'm struck by in technology how frequently you see the\npattern of excitement for, and a vision around a\ntechnology being so much earlier than the technology actually being ready. Like the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" which is in the '60s, like that was a voice activated AI with tool use, you know, capabilities. It's true.\nAnd, you know, it just took 50 years</p>\n<p>and then, you know, people\nwere excited about the idea that you could speak to\nyour computer and, you know, text to speech, speech to text. People were excited\nabout that in the '80s. And like only now, I don't\nknow if you use superwhisper or anything like that, but\nit's finally really good. But like it wasn't good\nthree years ago, you know, 40 years after the vision. Yeah, it's crazy that you bring that up. In fact, I used to have an apartment right next to the Microsoft\ncampus, that old campus, and I was working on\nInteractive Television. This was in '94. The information superhighway.</p>\n<p>That's right. You know, and there were multiple\nthings that were stunning. My management chain was\nRick Rashid and, you know, who reported to Craig Mundie, who reported to Nathan Myhrvold and there was Bill Gates and I was saying, \"Man,\nthat's a lot of IQ . And of course we all missed the internet. That was the only thing that happened. But I had interactive television, switched ATM, I think, to\nmy home in my apartment.</p>\n<p><strong>[21:11]</strong></p>\n<p>So I remember doing this demo, one of the high stakes things I did as a young guy at Microsoft was a demo of our first\nredundant file system, which was a video server where John Malone was the one who came and Bill was sort of saying, \"Hey, here's the future of\ninteractive television.\" And guess what? It's even great because\nthe disc can go, you know, haywire and still stream. And so my job was to remove the disc drive and have the stream continue. But we built essentially\na distributed file system and a streaming server</p>\n<p>and had an ATM switch\nnetwork to the house. And I had like five movies I could watch. And I watched them all multiple times. Okay, so I want to ask you about this, 'cause I've thought a lot about this and you're the perfect person to ask, which is, Microsoft\nsaw the internet future that was coming in the '90s, and in particular the famous Bill Gates Internet Tidal Wave memo said, \"The internet is the one big thing Microsoft needs to focus on.\" It wasn't like, \"We're not\nthinking about the internet.\" It wasn't that it was\npriority number 7 of 15.</p>\n<p>It was like, \"Hey, guys, listen up. The only thing Microsoft\nshould be thinking about is the internet.\" But the vision for the\ninternet at the time was this information superhighway, which was subtly different\nfrom the internet because the thinking was, and\nit was very sensible thinking, no one has internet to the\ncomputer in their home. Like, a lot of people don't\nhave a computer in their home. So what people do have is a TV and what they have is cable, which is a high bandwidth connection. And so we're going to do\nthese set top boxes on the TV and that is how people\nwill use the internet. Like, paying a huge amount of\nattention to this coming wave.</p>\n<p>Pretty sensible, well\nthought out solution, and yet not the right approach. And so obviously bring that up in the context of the giant AI. Like, what should one take away from that? It's great one. See, if I look at even my interpretation, it'll be actually interesting. I've not spent as much time\ntalking to Bill about that era. But I felt there were at least... As someone, as a sort of\nan entry level employee at that time even, my reading of history was that we kind of got the internet, but we didn't.</p>\n<p>Because we wanted to deliver,\nremember the quality... Like, I don't think we believed\nthat TCP/IP would work. I mean, at some level\nthe information highway, when I look at what we were trying to do was, man, this quality\nof service is a thing. This TCP/IP just is not going to work. And so therefore we were\ncompeting against AOL, on dial up and even that sort of... You remember like MSN was an X.25 network. Yes, yes.\nThe first version of it. Yes.\nAnd so then...</p>\n<p>But that's when Bill like pivoted, right? So the thing that Bill\ndid was in '95, I guess... In fact, it's funny that, right, Windows 95 was launching, and then he says, \"You know what?\" It's all going to change.\" So I feel between '92, which is when I think all of us, maybe who'd got our first demo, right, '93, November is when Mosaic...</p>\n<p><strong>[24:12]</strong></p>\n<p>Right?\nYeah, that's right. I think something like that. And so we all, you know, were kind of dancing around it. So from '93 to '95, there was that two year\nperiod where it was unclear whether this was going to be the protocol and the stack emerged. And by '95 it was clear,\nand then we pivoted. Interesting. Okay, so just at that time\nit wasn't actually clear that the open internet would win. Yes. And in fact, there's\none more lesson that... You know, the interesting\nthing that I've always watched, and because I think we\ncan parlay this into AI,</p>\n<p>one is to get the paradigm right. Then, it's not clear, even if\nyou get the paradigm right, that you may not get\nwhat is the killer app or even the business model, like, that's always been the case, right? Which is, you know, with the internet, who would've thought that, you know, for the open web, an organizing layer would be one proprietor or one network effect\nsearch engine, right? Because the organizing layer of the web, you know, I always say\nlike, \"There's no such thing as the open web, there's the Google web.\"</p>\n<p>And just because they just dominated it. Should one reflect on the fact that maybe there was\nsome motivated thinking around our proprietary solution, you know, the Liberty Media, Microsoft\njoint venture will win? Whereas the open web is what won and you should maybe caution organizations where if they're following\ntwo possibilities, you know, our information superhighway\nproprietary system</p>\n<p>or the open web, companies will somehow have happy thinking towards\nthe proprietary solution. It's an interesting one,\nI think the way, you know, when I look back again,\nit's interesting, right? So AOL and MSN kind of, you know, lost out, let's call it, to the open web, except they were replaced\nby new forms of AOL and MSN. They're called search engines. They're called app stores. Like, the mobile web\nin fact is fascinating.</p>\n<p>Yeah, the open web was\na moment in history. A moment in history, and then... And so the thing that,\nmaybe the meta thing for me is organizing layers will always emerge even in an open ecosystem and a lot of the category power moves to that organizing layer. And it's always unclear,\nlike the last paradigm or this last time it was search engines, today it's chat bots. How long lasting is that? No one knows, but it's definitely, today, I mean, ChatGPT's\nsuccess cannot be denied in terms of what it means\nas an aggregation point.</p>\n<p>Marketplaces/app stores have been a thing. What comes next, you know? What happens to e-commerce in an agentic marketplace\nor an agent e-commerce? I think these are the interesting things that need to be litigated. Well, I want to talk about that and I want to talk about\ncommerce, but actually first, while we're on the topic of,\nwhile we're still in the '90s, everyone is making comparisons to the dot-com bubble right\nnow, it's almost a cliche.</p>\n<p><strong>[27:14]</strong></p>\n<p>And I think it's actually\na reasonable comparison. You know, it's a cliche for a reason, which is, it is a very\nCapEx intensive build out for a new paradigm that\nis in fact a big deal and yet there's an awful lot of CapEx. You were there at Microsoft\nduring the 2000 dot-com bubble and it really was, you know, Microsoft's share price peaked in the late '90s, early 2000s, and then didn't surpass it\nuntil 2016, I want to say. What did it feel like in 1999?</p>\n<p>In particular, did you\nknow you were in a bubble? Or was it like, \"Oh, this\ntime it's different.\" It's interesting. Yeah. Yeah, in fact, I remember,\nI think, you know, we probably became the largest\nmarket cap company in 2000, we crossed GE, I remember that. Yeah, we were capital-light,\nlet's say, right? That time around, it was like... I guess I was more like Sam at that time, which is somebody else's\ncapital was being spent. It is, quite honestly,\nwhen I look back at it, at that time too, the\nfinancial cycle aside,</p>\n<p>it was clear, the secular trend was clear that this is going to. Because even by then, the business models were also emerging. Even for Microsoft, the\nbiggest lesson at that time was, oh, my God, like\neven our first order play, or, oh, we got to build a browser, we got to build a web server. We've got to, you know, have\ninternet protocols everywhere. You know, we had a website builder</p>\n<p>inside of office with front page. We did all the obvious things, but we realized that just\ndoing the obvious things didn't make sense. We needed to reinvent what we were doing, plus what are the new\nbusiness models, was clear. So in an interesting way, that cycle kind of came out of nowhere. I mean, it came out of, you\nknow, what was just, you know, whatever rational\nexuberance or what have you, but the correction in some sense washed away a bunch of stuff. But I would say the ideas persisted.</p>\n<p>Totally.\nRight? And so, to me, I think\nabout what's happening here. I mean, there are two things, right? The infrastructure itself\nthat's getting laid out, I think it's got a lot more immediate. Like, it's not like even the,\nyou know, the gestation period of okay, I built up, you know, dark fiber, and you know, some internet\ncompany will first scale to a billion users and use. This time\u2014\nThere are lines out the door to buy this stuff. Exactly, and so this time around, quite frankly, we are behind, right? Like when I look at our\ninfrastructure build, right,</p>\n<p>and demand today. That's the thing that when people say it's all a, you know, there's a bubble. Like, when I look at my\nearnings, I can have... Like, I mean, that was the last time I was so supply\nconstrained on PowerShells. I haven't heard that comparison before, which is, let's not forget\nthat the dot-com bubble, which again was a telecoms bubble, it was a fiber bubble in a big way.</p>\n<p><strong>[30:15]</strong></p>\n<p>Like, it was dark fiber,\nthe clue's in the name, it was dark, it was not lit up yet. And this is anything but dark fiber. Yeah, it's not like any\none of us is sitting there and saying, \"Hey, I have\nall the GPUs wired up and nobody's using them.\" I don't have a utilization problem. I may have a PUE, like, I mean, I want higher utilization because it's mostly because\nit's memory bottleneck or what have you, but\nthat is a different... But like there is not a thing that I have that's not sold out. In fact, my problem is I\ngot to bring more supply. And in that, will we perfectly get it? No one does, right?</p>\n<p>There's no supply chain operation that perfectly matches demand and supply. But this time around\nthe build out, you know, given the long lead, like for example, one of the things we study a lot is, even when we talk about our capital, we try to describe it even to the Street. Hey, you got to remember these assets. Some of these assets are 20 years. Some of these things are\nfour years or five years. And in fact you kind of\nhave to make the decisions on those things differently, right? Having a cold shell that's\nunused is nothing, right?</p>\n<p>Yeah. it's kind of like having\na campus with five buildings. It's not sort of going to be a problem on Microsoft's balance sheet. What is a real problem would be, hey, not having warm shells that we can kind of light up. Where is the bottleneck these days? Like, is it electricians, is it shells? Is it turbines.\nYeah, I mean, so... Yeah, the product that is the bottleneck is just a bunch of powered up shells. So if I don't have enough\nshells that are powered,</p>\n<p>that I can then roll in my racks and then make them operational. And that's the long lead part, right? Which is you kind of have\nto have the land permits, the power permits, get\nall that done in time. And by the way, location, right? So I think one of the\nthings that's glossed over, of course stateside, United\nStates, we are building a lot, but we have to build all over the world. And there are data regulations,\nin fact, more every day. People care about sovereignty\nin a major, major way.</p>\n<p>And so therefore for\nus, we have to make sure that the fleet is a global fleet, a fleet that kind of can deal\nwith all types of workloads, training to DataGen, to inference. And so it's sort of a\ncomplex, multi-variable thing. Who should care about data sovereignty? Where, you know, Ireland\nhas a bunch of data centers but is not particularly wound\nup on the idea that, you know, data should only be in Ireland. And I don't think it\nshould be super wound up about that fact, but, well, I guess,</p>\n<p>do you guys just go with\nwhatever the country wants or do you try to advise on whether you should want\ndata sovereignty or not, and who should? Yeah, so I think it's obviously\na topic that's top of mind for pretty much every country, every policy maker, and they care. And there's obviously\nreal legitimate reasons. The thing that I would say, in the AI age,</p>\n<p><strong>[33:17]</strong></p>\n<p>I'm now thinking a little bit differently even about sovereignty. What I mean by that is the\nultimate sovereignty question is more of what's the future\nof a corporation, right? Like, I mean, if you sort\nof start by, you know, if you go to the core\nof the Coase theorem, you say, \"Wow, what the heck? You know, if the model is the\nthing that knows everything, why do I even... Like, I'm supposed to\nhave some tacit knowledge that makes the transactional\ncosts inside my organization lower than just being in the marketplace.\" So that's a mind bender.</p>\n<p>So in fact, one of the ways I think is the sovereignty that matters is your company's sovereignty in a age where there\nare continual learning, increasing returns to a model. So I'm increasingly thinking\nthat hey, company's ability to have that intelligence\nlayer that's a scaffold or even weights embedded in the model. Like, so it's not somebody\nelse's foundation model. It's about do you have sovereignty\nin your foundation model? So my new concept is\nthe future of a company is that company has its\nown foundation model</p>\n<p>that captures essentially\nthat passive knowledge that makes the transactional costs of how knowledge gets accrued and diffused inside the organization faster. So that's sort of a long\nspeech on sovereignty. Well, there's two versions of... That's very interesting, the idea that AI maybe just changes the\nnature of companies. And you are saying that if companies, some companies are already\ncollections of IP, right?</p>\n<p>You know, Disney, we just had Dave Ricks from Eli Lilly here, that is\nan IP company in a big way. And some companies are\nalready collections of IP. But right now that IP is in\nall the emails and documents and people's heads most importantly. Whereas maybe the IP could be\nin a single model over time. Where I thought you were\ngoing to go with that is just maybe the, you\nknow, people point out a lot that current companies are\nmodeled after, you know,</p>\n<p>manufacturing companies and\nAlfred Sloan type stuff, despite the fact that, you know, we're doing knowledge work today and not running a little\nmanufacturing line. And do you get more just\nweird looking companies, do you get the, you know, the famous, really tiny billion dollar company? Do you get more highly\ndistributed internet companies? Do you get some DAOs? I thought that's where\nyou're going to go with that. I think that those are also possibilities. So the structure itself could change and it's going to be more\npossible for, you know, whatever the few, you know, the one person billion dollar\ncompany, what have you, right?</p>\n<p>Make that happen or DAOs could happen. But the interesting\nquestion, at least for me is, where does tacit knowledge reside, right? Clearly it resides in people's heads and it's the classic knowhow\nthat accrues in compounds. I think it will also reside and compound as weights in some LoRA layer</p>\n<p><strong>[36:22]</strong></p>\n<p>that is unique to your company. So that's kind of my... So in fact, I feel like, hey, you know, the new intellectual property\nat Eli Lilly or at Microsoft or at Stripe at some point can be also be besides all the humans, besides all the other artifacts we have, I think we'll also say, \"Oh,\nthey are in some embedding.\" Yes. Well, okay. It's funny you say this because Stripe, Stripe is interesting\n'cause it does not really have strong network effects as a company. You know, when we started\nbuilding up Stripe,</p>\n<p>it was very much a single\nplayer API experience and we make it easy to start using Stripe, but ultimately you'd never know that anyone else was using Stripe. What's happened as we've scaled up is we now just have a trust network where we can prevent fraud\nby virtue of the fact that we've seen most internet users. And so we have a knowledge for\nwhat good and bad looks like. And even the fact that we\nhaven't seen you before is inherently a little bit suspicious because we've seen most people and so it becomes a reputation network,</p>\n<p>kind like reCAPTCHA for Google simply became kind of\na reputation network. Anyway, what we're now doing is training a payments foundation model where we're using all\nthe data that we have in the Stripe network and you have a much\nlarger, more capable model taking into account... So anyway, we are trying to\ndo exactly what you're saying. And so one of the questions for all of us, then how do you protect that from sort of essentially leaking over to the base foundation model? Is it just like one capability hop away because it learned how to\neven do fraud detection?</p>\n<p>Is it just some other\nmultidimensional or not? And that I think is the\nkey question, right? To me, I think, there\nare two arguments, right? One argument is it's that, you know, argument that, hey, the models\nare going to eat the world. You can kind of easily see, oh yeah, after all, everything is just a pattern and I'll learn it all\nand what have you, so. But then the thing though is, you could, to your point about Stripe can take multiple models, build this unbelievable\nsort of, I'll call it fraud detection layer that\nis, you know, model forward.</p>\n<p>And then there is this\nmemory and tools use and action space that's\nall unique to Stripe. That to me is the future of a corporation. Whether it's a pharma\ncompany, a payments company, or a software company. That I think is the work\nthat we all are doing and will do, and I think\nthat that's, to me, that is sovereignty, right? Alright. Oh, man.</p>\n<p>Alright. Woo. Wow. Okay, this could be a new high score. And 4, 74. So, new high score.\nThere you go. I'm still thinking about this discussion we're having about the IDE for people who\naren't software engineers. And again, I feel like\nthere could be a product</p>\n<p><strong>[39:23]</strong></p>\n<p>in the next 10 years for finance people where, in hindsight, it is\nobviously the correct UI, but just like the spreadsheet kind of came out of nowhere as a UI, it may feel like it came\nout of nowhere at that time. I'm really struck by that. Speaking of the spreadsheet, it's like a rite of passage\nfor certain software companies to try to take on Excel and it's seems to be doing pretty well 40 years in or what have you. Why is it so durable? Yeah, it's unbelievable, right? I mean, at some level, you know,</p>\n<p>the idea that a tabular for... I mean, I think it's the\npower of lists and tables. It's just a perfect, and the malleability of software, right? That was I think the combination. So I think that's where the,\nwhat's the durability of a, that's why a blinking canvas, right? It's sort of like it's\nalways going to be there. We may add lots of bells\nand whistles to it. And the same thing with spreadsheets.</p>\n<p>The other thing about the spreadsheet is, it's Turing complete, right? I mean, that's the other, you know, Yeah, We sort of don't\ngive it enough credit. It's like I can make it do everything.\nI think it's the world's most approachable programming environment. 100%, I mean, it's kind of like, you know, and you get into it without\neven thinking your programming. And that is the other beauty, right? Which is like, you know, like\nAI still, we're mystified it. You and I talked about, oh, my God, we need change management. When spreadsheets came, nobody talked about change management. They were just using it. And that to me is the\nother thing which is...</p>\n<p>You know, like somebody\nwas describing to me, I was meeting the CEO of Generality, he joined Generality\nduring the fax machine era and he was managing all\ntheir insurance agents and he said to me like, \"Look, I still remember the day\nwhen emails showed up, Excel showed up and the entire workflow of how things happen\ncompletely were upended and evolved and changed ground up.\" And so to me, I think that\nthat's, to your point, what are those things of\nthis era that will discover,</p>\n<p>that'll allow the ground up\nrelitigation of the work, the work artifact and the workflow. It's such an interesting\ntime to be in software. I mean, compared to, you must feel this, like, it's just a much\nmore interesting time now than 5 or 10 years ago. You know, it is interesting, right? Which is what happened was\nwe were like, you know, Cloud, Cloud, Cloud. And, you know, if you had to ask me what is the hottest\nthing in, you know, 2019, we had built this fantastic multi region or regionless database that\nwas multi-format, right</p>\n<p>Cosmos DB, which was like,\nah, we had, you know, basically a JSON database. We had a SQL in there, it was the everything\ndatabase and we were thinking, oh, and it's regionless\nand blah, blah, blah. And then the pandemic happened and then Cloud went into\nanother hyper drive.</p>\n<p><strong>[42:23]</strong></p>\n<p>I mean, Teams, thank God,\njust became like the thing. So that was the exciting thing, and lo and behold, you come out of it and you sort of say, \"Oh, I\nthought, oh, after the pandemic we're going to get to some stable state.\" In fact, I remember a forecast\nof the Cloud, you know, we were saying, \"What do we do? We overbuilt during the pandemic,\" and there was a good eight months where we were, \"Oh, what...\" And then this thing now has come to. There's a lot of charts\nof the shape at Stripe.</p>\n<p>I don't know if it was\nthis way at Microsoft, where obviously March 2020 you saw this discontinuity, right? Much more eCommerce activity happening and we saw the rate of\nonline business creation. 'Cause, you know, you had\nbusinesses that were offline only saying, \"Oh, you know, we got\nto switch to selling online.\" And it just stayed at that\nelevated level forever obviously since, it's gone up from there. But there was no matching decline as people went back to, you know, into physical offices\nand things like that. It was just a step change and then it stayed at the\nelevated level forever. I'm sure you saw some of the things</p>\n<p>in Azure and things like that.\nYeah, 100%. It never came down. We're talking about\ncommerce, so we might as well talk about what we're working on together. So we are very excited about it. I mean, I think the idea that\nhas always been there is, which is what's the best way for a merchant friendly set of rails and what is a customer\nfriendly set of rails, right? Is there a perfect matching? Conversational sort of commerce is a thing that people have talked about. And now I think with the\nwork that you all have done</p>\n<p>and others have done, we kind of can really bring\nthe merchant and the end user and have this agentic sort of experience. So it's early days, it\nhas to be tastefully done, it has to be done in a way\nthat you earn the user's trust. And so I'm very excited about it. Yeah, we see two differences here because there have been\nprevious attempts as, you know, buying on Twitter, buying on Instagram and, you know, these kinds of things. But what's different\nhere is one, you have AI, so all the integrations for\nthe merchant are much easier.</p>\n<p>It's much less of a\nlift than previous times when things like that\njust have been tried. But then secondly, I\njust think the experience is so compelling as an end user. We're already seeing\nthis in the early data from the super early\ncustomers that we have. You know, we launched a few\nweeks back in ChatGPT as well that just, it has to work. And again, the data's\nalready bearing that out, because it's so much\neasier as an end customer. Yeah, I've been talking\nabout it like, you know,</p>\n<p>I'm a bit of a cricket nut so I kind of, I'm always searching for\nsomething and, you know, the problem is, you know, whether it's Amazon or\nWalmart or what have you, the search experience\nsometimes is hard on the site. So interestingly enough, these chat experiences\nfirst are fantastic, right? And the fact that they\npoint back to the catalog, I mean, the catalog is still king. But now if I can marry the\ncheckout and the catalog</p>\n<p><strong>[45:25]</strong></p>\n<p>and that to me is where\nI think the seamlessness. Well, and do you have any experiences, I've found versions of this, I'm curious if you've had experiences where for product research, using an AI app is so much better than, you know, keyword based search. It's amazing that up to last year we thought keyword based\nsearch was an acceptable way to hunt for anything.\nYeah, in fact, that's... Yeah, and the seller, like the bottom line is it's kind of like it is creating a custom catalog for you, right? I mean, the response is\nnot like a SERP, right? No, we were buying furniture in our house</p>\n<p>and we were just saying, \"Oh, yeah, we have this much space\navailable in this spot. What do you think is a\ngood, you know, piece that would look good in that spot that meets these dimensions,\"\nand things like that. But it's crazy that we weren't doing that previously, you know what I mean? And so all this kind of customization, being able to give vibes,\ngeneral aesthetics, \"I'm looking for like\nsomething slightly higher end but not super fancy.\" You know, it's crazy that\nyou weren't able to... By the way, that's just the\nother crazy, crazy thing. I know my wife's who's an architect</p>\n<p>and so she sort of has\nthis notebook, you know, Copilot notebook in\nwhich she has all these architectural pictures and so on. And you can ask it quite high\nlevel reasoning questions on what I should put in there. It's able to take an architectural sketch, a drawing, and then take a\npublic catalog of furniture and put those things\ntogether and reason about it. And that type of stuff is pretty magical. Like, our view on this,\nwe are, as you know, really AI pilled when it\ncomes to commerce at Stripe. And we think a huge amount will move here.</p>\n<p>And all the merchant\nconversations we're having are bearing that out. And the way I think about it is that if you are doing\nopen-ended discovery, \"Oh, I'm interested in an\noutfit to buy for this occasion, don't know exactly what I want,\" AI will be so much better\nat helping you with that than the current\nexperiences where, you know, you're clicking through\na list of search results or something like that. And then if you're doing targeted search where I'm looking for a specific object that meets these needs, \"I want this component for my bike.\" Then also being able to specify with AI</p>\n<p>the exact parameters\nof the search you have, will be much better. You're like, \"Wait, if you're taking all of the undirected discovery and if you're also taking all\nof the highly directed search, isn't that just like all the commerce that happens on the internet?\" I think the only thing that's left that's out of that is\nlike recurring staples. \"I need to order more pet food.\" That feels to me like the least affected. Though, of course you\nhave to discover the brand of pet food at some point originally. But yeah, that's kind of\nhow we're thinking about it. And again, Etsy has been\nan awesome first partner</p>\n<p>because all the products\nare custom, right? There's no... Yeah, that makes a ton of sense to me. I mean, the discovery part, which obviously people like Instagram and others have done a great job. So the question is what's\nthe discovery layer. We have, like, that's\none of the, you know, obviously personalized\ndiscovery layer inspiration</p>\n<p><strong>[48:27]</strong></p>\n<p>for a product, you know, what Pinterest has done is interesting. So some layer like that married with this\nconversational interface. Well, and of course it'll be a rising tide that lifts all boats where part of what we're doing with this is making merchant's product\ncatalogs remotely discoverable and inventory and everything like that. And then remotely purchasable where you don't necessarily have to go through the\nwhole flow on their side and everything like that. You can just do it inside the\nmagic wand Copilot experience. And so that is at like the\nraw nuts and bolts level what we are doing and\nwhat we're wiring up.</p>\n<p>I think then what's\nexciting is that, again, Pinterest played with commerce\nquite a few years back, maybe 10 years back. It hasn't taken off as a huge thing. But now if you have all the merchants who are offering their product catalogs as part of this protocol, then\nsocial sites like, you know, Pinterest and Instagram and Twitter get another run at this\nkind of commerce experience because you've way more merchant\nsupport and adoption for it than you had the first time around. Yeah, and we have a\nproject called the NLWeb and the idea is that,</p>\n<p>and which is to really take\nevery catalog of every merchant and give it like essentially a website, an NLWeb interface, that then an agent can talk\nto, to be able to interrogate and get the deep search, so to speak. Yes, yes, yes.\nBecause today in some sense, one of the biggest challenges\nis the quality of the catalog and the ability to use\nreasoning to do a deep search. And if you can solve\nthat, then to your point, every product will find its query. Yes, so we're building out this platform</p>\n<p>in agentic commerce\nwhere we have, you know, some open source protocols like our agentic commerce protocol. We obviously have the regular\nStripe products, you know, people are using us for, you know, and it's particularly kind of tricky from a payments point of view because you're looking to have an AI app do payments on behalf of other people across all these\ndifferent sites on the web without probably sharing\nall your payment details like all across the web. It's interesting payment\nthings that we're doing. Anyway, we're looking to\nbuild a platform business in agentic commerce.</p>\n<p>You guys seem to know a thing or two. What advice would you have for us as we build in this very nascent space, but when there clearly\nis product market fit? I mean, I think... I mean, you have done that, right? Which is one of the things that I would think is what does it mean to participate in this\nagentic workflow, right? For every merchant, right? Like, so every merchant now will have to sort of come\nto someone like Stripe and say, \"Hey, I have a\ncatalog, I have a checkout, please get me to meet agents,\" in the most friction-free way.</p>\n<p>And that's done tastefully is why I would think I would hire Stripe for. And I think the merchant onboarding, because I'm assuming the\nlong tail of merchants being able to click and say, \"Hey, enable me for agentic commerce,\" is going to be the thing\nthat's going to drive. Because the good news here is\nthere is going to be multiple, I mean, obviously ChatGPT is the big one,</p>\n<p><strong>[51:29]</strong></p>\n<p>but there's going to be, I mean, you know, Google's going to be there,\nwe're going to be there, Meta will be there, Perplexity, there's going to be a lot of competition. There's going to be a lot of front doors as aggregators.\nYes. But the more interesting\nthing is they themselves, will on their website\nor on their mobile app, will want to support\nnatural language queries. And so all of that being enabled for, or my own agents will go\ninterrogate those things. So I think that that's the key thing to be challenged, you know,\nor rather really solve well. Because going to a small merchant</p>\n<p>and saying, \"Hey, you go\nstand up an MCP server, do this protocol, that protocol,\"\nwhat's the easy button? I think the other thing\nthat's we're going to see is, and you're probably seeing this already, a merging of a bunch of\nthe agentic experiences. So we're talking about\nagentic commerce here. And we had Des Traynor from Intercom, they're now doing customer\nservice AI mediated and just like replacing humans, doing customer service with AI. But what they're seeing obviously is a huge amount of induced demand where people initially come\nfor the help desk type queries and it's like, \"Wow, this is\nhonestly a much better way</p>\n<p>to navigate the website.\" And it's almost like a command line for... Anyway, it can't quite\ntake as much actions now as it will be able to. But I also wonder how much\nall these experiences merge where like, we're doing\nthe buying stuff over here that is growing and\nexpanding and, you know, maybe there's some discovery\nand things like that. They're doing the customer\nservice stuff over there. It's universal. Yeah, that's a good point. When does it become a\ncommand-line application? Like, again, my example of this is I find the fashion space interesting where, how incredibly poor the tech is with a lot of websites out\nthere where people are trying</p>\n<p>to do this very aesthetic vibe space. \"I'm looking for something like that, but like a little more\nfancy,\" you know, whatever. And it's all keyword based search and manual tagging and things like that. And things like that feel\nto me perfectly set up for having an interactive AI\nbased experience where, again, like your Midjourney prompts, you're like, \"No, the\nimage wasn't quite right. Change it in this way.\" Just doing that with commerce, I think, will be really interesting.\nMakes sense. And I also think intuitively\nlike, I mean, all of us our inside sales is also,\nor rather customer service is also inside sales.</p>\n<p>Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And so intuitively that\nmakes sense, you know, and definitely in the agentic world, you can stitch these things together so that the seams are not\nlike to what they are today. Maybe what we're describing is a bunch of swim lanes\nhave been established by random accidents of\nsoftware and org charts and everything like that. You do customer service,\nwhen people come with a query is of a non-commercial\nnature, you are an SDR. That's right.\nYou know, you do whatever.</p>\n<p>And all those distinctions are probably going to get thrown away. We're talking lot about kind\nof the AI apps that people use and Copilot and ChatGPT and Gemini and all these kind of things. There's a debate about how\nmuch model quality matters and is it the case that people\npick a brand and, you know, they've been drinking, you\nknow, Coke for the longest time</p>\n<p><strong>[54:30]</strong></p>\n<p>and even if Coke's, I\nmean, Coke's a bad example, because there was a revolt\nabout the change in the formula. But, you know, even if they\nchange the formula, you know, people, they still have a preferred brand. You know, I use o3, my wife uses GPT-5. I'm always horrified\n'cause I'm like, you know, \"You deserve more intelligence than that.\" And, you know, you can take\no3 from my cold, dead hands. Where do you stand on the debate of do people have loyalty to it? And there was also the revolt when they tried to take away 4.0, was it?\nYeah, that's right. And people were really\nattached to that model. Do people have loyalty to a model or do they have loyalty to an AI brand? And how does this affect\nyour business strategy? I think that in the consumer products,</p>\n<p>this was the first time\nwe saw that, right? When you changed models, they're\nnot sort of uniform changes and they impact people differently, right? And personality is one such thing or style or what have you. And so it just sort of is a new dimension. So in other words, it's also an argument that, \"Oh, wow, this is a new dimension of perhaps differentiation,\" right? People will, you know,</p>\n<p>it's sort of, there's the IQ side of it, there's the EQ side of it, and then there is all these style points. And maybe that's kind of one of the things that people will steer things towards. But long term, for me, I think you have to kind of make sure that the models are most capable for the hardest high value tasks. And then you continuously optimize, after you have access to that, for what the task had had is, right? So as a product builder for us,</p>\n<p>and my thing is have the model drop which is the most capable, but then what's in production\nis multiple models. And my favorite, like, new\nthing in GitHub for example, is auto, which is I\nwant to keep, you know, people still obviously\nlove sonnet whatever, they want to use it. But at the end of the day, I\nreally want the model picker and it just can't be a\ndumb model router, right? It has to basically have the intelligence to know that this task\ndeserves this kind of cogs</p>\n<p>or this type of intelligence and this is my complexity\nof my repo or my PR task. That ultimately is where, you know, the future of agents would be, right? And so therefore you want the model, in fact, you want an ensemble of models that then, you know, you have agents intermediating that ensemble\nso that it meets your needs. And then you'll have preferences. Will everyone's preference not just be for more intelligence?</p>\n<p>Like, I'll go into the\npicker and manually select o3 for like, \"where should I\ngo get ice cream\" query? Like I always want the most\u2014 That's habit, don't you think? But that is, you know\u2014\nMaybe. But it's also an important\nconsidered decision. But it is true. I mean, like, it's very hard for any of us to take our, that's why defaults matter and we love our defaults. We don't love the cheese to be moved. You know, even the model\nselection stuff, you know,</p>\n<p><strong>[57:31]</strong></p>\n<p>it's kind of like, wow, if you now took away the\nmodel selection, you know, it's a problem and so therefore\nyou got to be careful. But I do think in the\nlong run, if I can trust, that's another one, right? Which is if I can trust something to always do something for me\nwhile it's making a selection that somehow is delightful, then that's when I'll hand off. Okay, and so you think that's\nwhat you need to get to, is me trusting that you'll\npick an appropriate model? Exactly.\nYeah. Yeah. And then, I mean, my\nmental model of Microsoft is that you just play at\nevery part of the stack</p>\n<p>in that there's the, you know, you have Copilot, you\nhave your stake in OpenAI, you have, well, we can get to\nvertical applications in AI. You have the Azure layer,\nyou have chips, everything. I leaving out a whole bunch of stuff. Are some more important\nto you than others? What is the must win? Will you do verticals? Yeah, I mean, at some level\u2014\nWhat's the nuance to that? Yeah, well, at the core, the way I kind of conceptualize it is our infrastructure business. We have to be fantastic at building what I'll call the token factory, right? This is the tokens per dollar per watt.</p>\n<p>Really being super efficient in that. Then I'll say we have another layer of it, which is the agent factory. And the difference\nbetween the token factory and the agent factory is use\nthe tokens most efficiently to drive a business outcome, or a consumer preference\noutcome, which is about\u2014 That's the value per token or something? Yeah, the value per token. And as evaled by sort\nof the specific domain that people care about. And that is, to your point,\nit has tooling around it. It has a whole host.</p>\n<p>It's kind of the new app tier or the app server, right? Every new platform has always had, there was the web and\nthere was a web server. This is the AI server in\nsome sense, or the AI cloud. Then we will definitely\nwant to build our own, I'll call it systems of\nintelligence or AI systems, that is the family of Copilot, right? Whether it's for information work, that's kind of what we have done. For coding or software development, that's the GitHub Copilot. Security's another domain where we are absolutely\ngoing to be a primary. Those would be the three horizontal.</p>\n<p>We will also have business applications. The other one that is, we're doing a lot in health and science. So in health the, you\nknow, we had bought nuance and now we have something\ncalled DAX Copilot and this is the notetaking diarization for physicians, right. So the ability to be able to have a doctor spend more time with their patients and then the AI do everything else in terms of everything from\ncoding to taking the notes. So that's one place we are, you know, have a great close partnership with Epic.</p>\n<p>It's embedded part of Epic. So that's kind of what\nwe are doing in health. And then we are also\ndoing stuff in Copilot for consumer health that\nsort of docks to it. But the other one is science. And the science, it turns\nout it's a big domain for what I'll call the outer\nloop orchestration, right? Which is the scientific\nmethod in some sense requires you to create the hypothesis,</p>\n<p><strong>[60:33]</strong></p>\n<p>then run these multiple\nexperiments in silico, come back, refine and so on. So that to me is another tool chain. It's kind of like we're trying\nto discover some combination of the GitHub Copilot meets Microsoft 365 Knowledge work, if you will, for the scientist where they have the authoritative\nsources of knowledge. They have even the interfaces tools used could even be, hey, the MCP server for the wet labs, so to speak.</p>\n<p>Can I interface with it? And then how do you\norchestrate all of this such that the scientific\nloop can go faster. As a platform company,\nyou always have decisions around when should you try\nand bundle products together, when should you try and staple them and mandate they be used\ntogether and when should you not. And, you know, I think the classic example for some reason that everyone talks about, despite it being quite minor, is the fact that Apple originally only let you use an iPod with a Mac</p>\n<p>and try to use it to drive Mac sales and then gave up and, you know, shipped iTunes for Windows. And my understanding reading\nthe \"Apple in China\" book is it was like a totally random decision that someone just made\nit, you know, one day. But it's often held up\nas one of these examples. Obviously Microsoft, the entire history is full of these interesting examples. I don't think people realize\nhow open Microsoft was in the early days where in 1985 most of Microsoft's revenue was\nfrom Macintosh applications. And then for the Microsoft\noperating systems,</p>\n<p>most of the applications\nwere third party, you know, like Lotus 1-2-3 and things like this. And so it was like a fully open strategy. And then you had the Windows\nera of the tight coupling between Office and Windows and those kind of mutually\nreinforcing each other. Then early on, I get the sense Azure and Cloud was, you know, oh, it's a place you\ncan run your SQL server. And then fully embracing Linux later on and things like that. I'm curious just to, 'cause again, we think about this as a platform company and we've been of late\nembracing much more modularity</p>\n<p>where Stripe Radar, you can use it even if you're not using\nStripe for payments and things like that. How do you in general\nthink about your framework for when products should be coupled versus when you sell them independently? That's a great point.\nAnd then, I have AI specific versions of that question. So the way I reason about it is, I think we overstate many times how many of these battles are\nquote, unquote, \"zero sum.\" So at some level, one of\nthe pieces of analysis that I think that you\nwant us to be sharp at is, what are by definition\ngoing to be multiplayer.</p>\n<p>Like Cloud is a classic example, right? Which is, I remember even back in the day when I got started, and obviously Azure got started much later than AWS, people would tell me, \"Oh,\nGod, isn't AWS so far ahead?\" Whereas is there a room\nfor a second Cloud? And having competed against Oracle and IBM on all the middle tier servers and so on, I felt like, no, this enterprise customer</p>\n<p><strong>[63:34]</strong></p>\n<p>and commercial customers by and large are going to demand sort of a multiple. And so that was the\nstructural understanding that drove us to even just be at it. And the rest is history. So a little bit of, to me,\nif you over package things, you might in fact sort of reduce your TAM, and not compete. Like for example, if we built Azure, in fact Azure's, you know, we just called Windows Azure, right? Oh, well, that's a problem. Because Azure makes no\nsense just for Windows. It's sort of got to support\nLinux as first class.</p>\n<p>It's got to support MySQL\nand Postgres as first class. And so that's what sort\nof allowed us to make sure that you have to actually have to do a great job with SQL Server. But you got to do as bang\nof a job as like, you know, Amazon would do with Postgres or MySQL. And so it was driven primarily\nby, hey, that's the TAM. That's what customers expect us. And we are going to\nhave tough competition. But, so to me that's kind of how I define my modularity, right? What's the thing</p>\n<p>that maximizes my stack's\nmarket opportunity, then yes, we are a firm, and the reason we we're\nnot a conglomerate. And so therefore there should be a theory of some integration benefits and platform effects. And so therefore, what is that and how do we do a great job of it? But each layer of the stack, right, even in, let's say\nin Azure, the token factory, somebody should be able to come and say, \"I just want to use Azure for its bare metal services. I just need Kubernetes, you\nknow, clustered all over, but I just need to you\nto do the management part</p>\n<p>and I'll bring all my software.\" No problem, we got to win that workload. Maybe then after that we'll\nat least have a shot someday when it becomes a real pain to manage sort of your\nmulti-region database on your own that you'll say, \"Oh,\nlet me just use Cosmos.\" But it's a separate decision. But isn't there always a debate between if we have Linux and\nAzure, we'll sell more Azure. But then the Windows people say, \"Yeah, but you're a hamstringing,\nyou know, Windows server.\" And there are some places\nlike you're describing where Microsoft's open, there\nare other places, you know,</p>\n<p>Microsoft Flight\nSimulator is not available on the PlayStation, it's\navailable on the Xbox. And that makes sense, you\nknow, it feels kind of natural to be integrated that way. I know this might be a bit\nof a stretch, but, you know, Teams Chat and Teams Video\nare not sold separately. They're just part of one\nthing, and that makes sense. It makes the bundle more compelling. And so don't you always\nend up in these debates as to does the bundling cost\noutweigh the bundling benefits? Yeah, and I think some of\nthose, like for example, Teams thing is, it's a classic one, which is Teams was born as a product that brought those four\nthings, like Outlook, right?</p>\n<p>Outlook was brought, you\nknow, there was a PIM before, there was an email client and calendaring was separate. And Outlook was the first scaffolding that said, \"Hey, we\nbring these three things to get a job done,\" right? So that was, and same\nthing with Teams, right? We brought chat and channels and video and what have you into one. So the bundling was the\nproduct to some degree, right?</p>\n<p><strong>[66:37]</strong></p>\n<p>That was the product scaffolding. And so then of course\nyou can then say, \"Hey, that needs to have an open marketplace and it needs to integrate\nwith other things,\" or what have you. So the modularity has\nto be thought through in ways that make sense\nat the atomic level. Then you don't want to\noverthink about the synergies or sort of integration effects and you're not competitive, right? A classic thing would be if you built an unbelievable public cloud, except it only ran Windows\nworkloads or SQL workloads, that'll be essentially a very\nsmall sliver of the market.</p>\n<p>So it was in our sort of interest and definitely in the interest of meeting the customer needs. And so being able to sort of\nreally click in the AI stack, that's kind of how I look at it, right? We have an infra business, we\nhave an app server business, and we have an apps business. It's just simplifying. I want those three things to stand for them on their own merits. We ourselves of course want\nto have the feedback loop across these three layers, but customers and partners will choose</p>\n<p>which door they enter through. This impression I have is that when you took over Microsoft, you shifted the culture\nfrom a highly bundled, you'll buy your Windows machines and they're running Microsoft Access and you know, they're a SQL server and everything is like\nneatly packaged together in this Microsoft life to moving towards more of an open and\ninteroperable strategy. I think that the way I would say is my thing was to go back even to the Microsoft of the\n'80s perhaps, right?</p>\n<p>Because most of what happened\nwas really in the '90s there was Microsoft. and there was pretty much nothing else. And so there was sort of a lot more of our things coming together, whether it was on the\nclient or on the server. The '80s were like to your point, right? You know, we built Office on the Mac. Windows came later. In fact, the concept that Bill had when he started Microsoft\nwas it's a software factory. I'm not in love with any one category. I'm just like going to build\nthe best software factory</p>\n<p>and it's going to churn out whatever, flight sim\u2014\nInterpreters. Flight sim, you want, you know, a basic interpreter. No problem, we have one. You want an operating\nsystem, we have one too. So in some sense that was the idea. And at what point we got into a lock between four or five parts of\nthat, that became the Windows and Windows NT and client\nserver and what have you. And so I sort of realized that\nwhen, you know, I became CEO and even when I was\nrunning our Cloud business, that, hey, this is a time where, you know, the market's going to be a lot\nbigger and a lot different.</p>\n<p>And we didn't, like, we didn't\nhave the mobile platform at that time and so therefore\nwe really needed to make sure we would stay relevant\nin the largest markets that we could address by bringing our products\ntogether in configurations that made sense. So it is actually a lot more less dog... There was not that much dog... In fact, I would say, you know, if it was not in the\ncore DNA of the company, I don't think just because\nI showed up as a CEO</p>\n<p><strong>[69:38]</strong></p>\n<p>and I said, \"I want to do this,\"\nwe would've executed well. It was in the core DNA of the company that we can in fact take our\nsoftware to every platform. Yes, speaking of the\ncore DNA of the company, there's the famous cartoon of, you know, Microsoft with all the guns\npointing at each other. How much cultural tweaking\ndid you have to do? And how do you actually do that when you get down to brass tacks? 'Cause you can see all the nice things, the all hands and things like that, but ultimately culture comes down to what you will and won't tolerate</p>\n<p>and how decisions are\nmade and things like that. Yeah, I mean, I'd say there are two things that I learned from that entire episode because I always say, look, I'm a consummate insider, right? Anything good and bad about Microsoft of the last 35 years, I lived through them all\nand I'm part of it, right? So I can't deny any of it. The thing that I felt\nwas, a little bit of that was just we lost our own belief because we lost the narrative. That cartoon is a great\nexample of someone else defining what became\nthe cultural narrative more so than reality, right?</p>\n<p>The people started to\nidentify with the cartoon. That's right, I mean,\nthat's kind of one of the... I think that one of the fundamental issues of today's social media and the zeitgeist is you can absolutely lose narrative. It's reflexive\nYeah, it's completely reflexive. Like, so one of the interesting things is, of course all of these\nthings have signal, right? So this doesn't mean, oh, wow,\nwe were all perfect divisions and we were all sort of, you\nknow, in greater harmony. That is not the case. But you know, in some sense, some of these divisional\ntensions are real issues that need to have tension, right?</p>\n<p>You can't have... Like, social cohesion is not a goal, Winning in the marketplace is a goal, but at some level you have to orchestrate these large organizations. In fact, you may even\nhave two competing teams by design. And just because somebody\nsort of said, \"Hey, I'm going to read the New Yorker and there's going to be a cartoon,\" like, that's the type of stuff that I think leaders, and how to communicate in today's world where your employees\nread about you outside</p>\n<p>and form opinions about you is one of the toughest\nleadership challenges, I think. Which is how do you earn the trust? How do you really make sure that they can in fact feel the\nreality, shape the reality? Like the other thing is\neverybody thinks it's the system. It's that guy at the\ntop or, you know, my VP and they have all the\npower and I have none. The reality is the power\nis a lot more diffused and distributed and so therefore</p>\n<p>how do you really help people especially get hold of that and reshape. Like, you know, one of\nthe other famous things people say is, \"Hey, I\nnever leave companies, I leave managers.\" And, you know, I believe that, right? And so it's kind of micro\ncultures and they can be shaped.</p>\n<p><strong>[72:38]</strong></p>\n<p>In fact, when I look back\nat my Microsoft career, I was lucky to fall into these people who created these\nunbelievable environments in the company, right? And that's kind of why I stayed and that's how I thrived. And so to some degree, you know, I feel that the more culture... You need at the top, a narrative that you have to live\nand be consistent, right? So that's where this growth mindset or learn-it-all versus know-it-all has been super helpful\nfor us as just a frame because nobody thinks of\nit as my dogma, right? Thank God it's not, you know,</p>\n<p>it's a well understood\nchild psychology thing that appeals to people outside of work. And so cracking something\nlike that and then living it, but also somehow I would say the challenge for all of us in today's world is, let the social media memes not define us. What's that inner strength that\nis there in an organization that can in fact resist the social meme? That I think is the key. How many people is Microsoft?</p>\n<p>I think around 200,000. Okay, so rough number is, you know, Microsoft is 200,000 people,\nStripe is 10,000 people. Maybe there's someone\nwho's listening to this who runs a company that's 500\npeople or something like that. A lot of the things that we do are probably fairly scale independent where you're trying to make sure that you're talking to customers, you're holding a leadership offsite. We're looking at the numbers for '26. We want the revenues to be a bit higher and the cost to be a bit lower. You know, there's a lot\nof activities in companies that are kind of the same\nregardless of the size. That said, there's also probably things</p>\n<p>that only show up at the,\nyou know, 200,000 person, you know, city state size that, you know, I wouldn't be aware of at the 10,000 person size. What effects only show\nup when you're that big? There are two things I would say. Quite honestly, having\nonly worked at Microsoft, it's not that I'm like an expert. But the one thing I would say,\ntaking over for a founder, you know, Steve and\nBill built the company, I mean, Paul and Bill started</p>\n<p>and Steve and Bill scaled it and I was the sort of\nthe first, quote unquote, \"non-founder person.\" The thing I realized quickly,\nor in fact I got into the job and I realized that I need a team. And just to have the\nability to manage the scope. But then, you know, that A.G. Lafley thing that we put out there, which\nI think is a great one. Like what is this, being clear about what does the CEO clearly need\nto do though in that, right? Which businesses are you in?</p>\n<p>Which businesses are you out\nsynthesizing the outside, having the standards, setting\nthe standards for culture, and then the ability to your point about having that performance culture that you can't say, \"Hey,\nI'm only about the long term, or I'm only about the short term.\" You've got to deliver both. Getting a real grip of\nthe four or five things</p>\n<p><strong>[75:41]</strong></p>\n<p>that only you can do. And then building the\nteam, building the team. You'd say, \"Even at a 500\nperson, that's what you do.\" But quite frankly, you can keep in your\nworking memory, right, growing up as a developer, right? There was a set of things\neverybody would talk about. How many lines of code do\nyou know, right, personally? At some point you sort of\nsay, \"Oh, that's the person who knows that module or that library.\" That becomes more, like, and everybody starts where\nthey know every line of code. At some level then you\nhave to get to the person who knows, \"Oh, I know the\nperson who wrote that.\"</p>\n<p>And I think that that modularity and team building and the cohesiveness is, I\nthink they most important. So am I understanding you correctly that maybe at the Stripe scale or at a smaller scale, you can still reason about\nthe product as a product and know everything that you're shipping and\neverything like that\u2014 But I also think founders\nare unique in that sense. because the founders are, you know, that's kind of what is\nsingular about them, right? Because they've grown\nup with it from day one. See, it's kind of hard</p>\n<p>to take the working memory of a founder and say, \"Oh, let me\ntake it and imprint it.\" Sort of a professional CEO. It just doesn't work because the... You know, even for me, I joined the company in '92, I was not there in the\nearly '80s, right, you know? And so to some degree it\nwas a continuous scale that only the, quote\nunquote, \"the founder, CEO\" or the founders see it. And so that's why I think having respect</p>\n<p>for what founders can do uniquely and founders having respect\nfor whoever comes next, that they can't be like\nwe're doing exactly the same thing that they did, right? So that's why I think\nthis founder mode thing is interesting, which is that\nclearly there is, you know, the culture personality of a\nfounder is unbelievable, right? And you use it, maximize it. Then mere mortal CEOs like us have to sort of also be, you know, you can sort of be in the refounder mode but don't think you are a founder. And that nuance I think\nis an important one.</p>\n<p>Last question, because we're\nrunning up against time, as we talk about cultures\nand building them, what's going on in the water\nin Hyderabad where, you know, the school that you went, also Shantanu went there,\nAjay Banga went there. A bunch of good chess players\nare similarly from there and southern India more\nbroadly and things like that. But do you have any theory\non the local outperformance? Yeah, the high school we\nwent to in fact, yeah.</p>\n<p>Until I would say NVIDIA and Jensen, because Jensen has it now\ncovered for all of us. Yeah, between me and Ajay and Shantanu. In fact the CEO of Procter & Gamble today is also from my high school. See, it's cabal. It's kind of a cabal. I would say one of the fascinating things</p>\n<p><strong>[78:41]</strong></p>\n<p>growing up in Hyderabad\nand going to that school in the middle of nowhere at\nthat time in the late '70s and the early '80s, I would say, I think it gave us a lot more space. If you look at even each of us, right? Academics was a thing, but quite frankly, we, mostly all of us had things which we excelled at a lot of other things\nbeyond academics in fact. That was a pretty rare thing\nat that time in that country. And so I attribute it\na lot to my high school because I feel that it is a place where it gave us a lot more space and room</p>\n<p>to follow what really became your passion. But you were able to take\nyour time to discover it versus sort of feeling that, \"Hey, I had to join some kind of a race.\" It wasn't as tracked.\nThat's right. Yeah.\nThat's right. What was your passion in high school? Cricket. In fact, this, by the\nway, the Samuel Beckett. Yeah, so I want to know the story. Sure, you know who... So if you asked the question, who is the one sports person who played actually professionally? I guess he played one or two matches</p>\n<p>for I guess the Dublin University and he played first class cricket. And so he's the only person\nwho played professional cricket and won a Nobel Prize. Really? That's really funny. So you can have it all is the\u2014 There you go. The chess, boxing of its\nday or something, you know, merging the\u2014\nA Nobel Prize winner and he's a professional cricketer. That's awesome. Well, you know, you, you came close but in another life, you know,\nthat could have been you. Alright.\nThank you so much. Thanks, Satya.\nIt's such a pleasure.</p>"}
