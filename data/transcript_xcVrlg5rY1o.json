Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov discuss, on Raging Moderates.\n#trump #epsteinfiles #podcast", "transcript_html": "<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>\n<p>You know\nhow I am about women that do things\nlike this. Let's talk about\nghislaine maxwell. Where do you think her case goes\nfrom here? I don't think\nanywhere that she wants\nit to. Representative\nPaulina Luna said, \u201caccording\nto the files we saw, ghislaine maxwell \nwas engaged in traffic\nand rape. I don't think\nshe deserves special treatment. She's a monster.\u201d I hope that there is\nsome world in which Maxwell\nis moved back to the bad\nprison, and has to rot\nin there for the rest of her\nlife. I don't think you can trust a single word that comes out of her mouth. I think her testimony\nis meaningless. She committed\npsychological</p>\n<p>and physical torture on these girls. I don't know if I\nreally mean this, but to some degree, the person who is recruiting\nand feeding these girls\nto Jeffrey Epstein almost feels worse. You know how I am\nabout women that do things like this, where I just think that there is something built into us\nas the people who bring other people\ninto the world, that you should not\nbe this depraved and sick. And I think that\nif Trump is reading any tea leaves\nor Susie Wiles is,</p>\n<p>she knows that there can be no kind treatment for\nghislaine maxwell, and that no one\ntrusts anything\nthat she says.</p>"}
