Let&#x27;s talk about ghislaine maxwell. Where do you think her case goes from here? I don&#x27;t think anywhere that she wants it to. Representative Paulina Luna said, \u201caccording to the files we saw, ghislaine maxwell was engaged in traffic and rape. I don&#x27;t think she deserves special treatment. She&#x27;s a monster.\u201d I hope that there is some world in which Maxwell is moved back to the bad prison, and has to rot in there for the rest of her life. I don&#x27;t think you can trust a single word that comes out of her mouth. I think her testimony is meaningless. She committed psychological</p>\n<p>and physical torture on these girls. I don&#x27;t know if I really mean this, but to some degree, the person who is recruiting and feeding these girls to Jeffrey Epstein almost feels worse. You know how I am about women that do things like this, where I just think that there is something built into us as the people who bring other people into the world, that you should not be this depraved and sick. And I think that if Trump is reading any tea leaves or Susie Wiles is, she knows that</p>\n<p>there can be no kind treatment for ghislaine maxwell, and that no one trusts anything that she says.</p>", "chapters_count": 0}
