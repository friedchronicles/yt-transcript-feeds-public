In addition to his academic research, he writes about the intersection of digital technology and culture. Cal's particularly interested in our struggle to deploy these tools in ways that support instead of subvert the things we care about in both our personal and professional lives.\n\nCal is a New York Times bestselling author of seven books, including, most recently, A World Without Email, Digital Minimalism, and Deep Work. He's also the creator of The Time-Block Planner.\n\nThe videos are considered to be used under the \"Fair Use Doctrine\" of United States Copyright Law, Title 17 U.S. Code Sections 107-118.
