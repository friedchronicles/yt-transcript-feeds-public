As partners at a16z investing across infrastructure and growth, they\u2019ve watched venture and growth blur, model labs turn dollars into capability at unprecedented speed, and startups raise nine-figure rounds before monetization.\n\nMartin and Sarah join us to unpack the new financing playbook for AI: why today\u2019s rounds are really compute contracts in disguise, how the \u201craise \u2192 train \u2192 ship \u2192 raise bigger\u201d flywheel works, and whether foundation model companies can outspend the entire app ecosystem built on top of them. They also share what\u2019s underhyped (boring enterprise software), what\u2019s overheated (talent wars and compensation spirals), and the two radically different futures they see for AI\u2019s market structure.\n\nWe discuss:\n\u2022 Martin\u2019s \u201ctwo futures\u201d fork: infinite fragmentation and new software categories vs. a small oligopoly of general models that consume everything above them\n\u2022 The capital flywheel: how model labs translate funding directly into capability gains, then into revenue growth measured in weeks, not years\n\u2022 Why venture and growth have merged: $100M-$1B hybrid rounds, strategic investors, compute negotiations, and complex deal structures\n\u2022 The AGI vs. product tension: allocating scarce GPUs between long-term research and near-term revenue flywheels\n\u2022 Whether frontier labs can out-raise and outspend the entire app ecosystem built on top of their APIs\n\u2022 Why today\u2019s talent wars ($10M+ comp packages, $B acqui-hires) are breaking early-stage founder math\n\u2022 Cursor as a case study: building up from the app layer while training down into your own models\n\u2022 Why \u201cboring\u201d enterprise software may be the most underinvested opportunity in the AI mania\n\u2022 Hardware and robotics: why the ChatGPT moment hasn\u2019t yet arrived for robots and what would need to change\n\u2022 World Labs and generative 3D: bringing the marginal cost of 3D scene creation down by orders of magnitude\n\u2022 Why public AI discourse is often wildly disconnected from boardroom reality and how founders should navigate the noise\n\nSubstack Article w/Show Notes: https://www.latent.space/p/a16z\n\n\u2014\n\nMartin Casado\n\u2022 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincasado/\n\u2022 X: https://x.com/martin_casado\n\nSarah Wang\n\u2022 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-wang-59b96a7\n\u2022 X: https://x.com/sarahdingwang\n\na16z\n\u2022 https://a16z.com/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 \u2013 Intro: Live from a16z\n00:01:20 \u2013 The New AI Funding Model: Venture + Growth Collide\n00:03:19 \u2013 Circular Funding, Demand & \u201cNo Dark GPUs\u201d\n00:05:24 \u2013 Infrastructure vs Apps: The Lines Blur\n00:06:24 \u2013 The Capital Flywheel: Raise \u2192 Train \u2192 Ship \u2192 Raise Bigger\n00:09:39 \u2013 Can Frontier Labs Outspend the Entire App Ecosystem?\n00:11:24 \u2013 Character AI & The AGI vs Product Dilemma\n00:14:39 \u2013 Talent Wars, $10M Engineers & Founder Anxiety\n00:17:33 \u2013 What\u2019s Underinvested?
