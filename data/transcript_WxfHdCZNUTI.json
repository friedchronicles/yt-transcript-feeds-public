So, this is where we like to get super practical. Here&#x27;s what I want to do today is I&#x27;m going to take a very piece of practical internet advice and we&#x27;re going to dissect it. Let me load this on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening. It&#x27;s from the YouTuber Dan Co. It&#x27;s an article he posted as an essay on Twitter called How to Fix Your Entire Life in One Day. And let me zoom in on that. 173 million reads so far. That&#x27;s pretty crazy, Jesse. That&#x27;s like almost as many copies as I&#x27;ve sold of How to Become a High School Superstar. I was just gonna</p>\n<p>say &gt;&gt; not quite not quite how to become a high school superstar level. But man, that guy is getting close. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s getting close to that level. Um I didn&#x27;t even know you could post essays on Twitter. I guess that&#x27;s a thing. Uh I&#x27;ll tell you who&#x27;s going to be doing it now. Everybody. Because this one article got 173 million views. Anyways, how to fix your entire life in one day. Viral internet advice. Why are we going to look at that in the practices segment? Well, it&#x27;s practical advice and we&#x27;re going to break it apart and we&#x27;re going to go through the the seven suggestions he has. But I&#x27;m thinking about this exercise in the light of last week&#x27;s</p>\n<p>episode where we had Brad Stolberg on and he was talking about his new book, The Way of Excellence. And we were talking about in general what is the impact of in the internet on our natural instinct for ambition and we said look it could be one of two things. Sometimes it actually can help guide us and help us fulfill our ambitions. And sometimes it can hijack our ambitions, but sort of like nonsense content that in the moment feels really good, but is actually distracting us from things that really matter. This seems like a great case study to apply this type of thinking. Is Dan Co super viral article</p>\n<p>is something that&#x27;s hijacking our ambition or supporting it? So, we&#x27;re going to go through it real quick and uh I&#x27;ll get Jesse&#x27;s opinion. I&#x27;ll tell you my opinion. I actually talked to Brad about this last night, so I&#x27;ll tell you what he said. So, we&#x27;re going to kind of have a little court of inquiry at the end. All right. So, we&#x27;re going to go through this really quickly. Um I&#x27;m going to start by reading from his intro his words just to set up how he describes this and then we&#x27;ll go through a seven piece of advice. So, here&#x27;s what Dan says. If you&#x27;re anything like me, you think New Year&#x27;s resolutions are stupid. Because most people go about changing</p>\n<p>their lives in a completely wrong way. They create these resolutions because everyone else does. We create a superficial meaning out of status games. But they don&#x27;t meet the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than convincing yourself you&#x27;re going to be a more dis more disciplined or more productive this year. I&#x27;m eliding a little bit. However, as much as I think New Year&#x27;s resolutions are stupid, it&#x27;s always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself towards something that that&#x27;s much better as we will discuss. So whether you want to start the business or transform your body or take the risk toward a more</p>\n<p>meaningful life without quitting after 2 weeks, I want to share seven ideas you probably haven&#x27;t heard before on behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in 2026. All right, so that&#x27;s a pretty lofty goal, Jesse. Um, he has seven pieces of advice. Let&#x27;s go through these one by one. I&#x27;ll give you a quick summary. All right. So, here&#x27;s piece of advice one. I&#x27;ll show it briefly on the screen. Uh, you you aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you aren&#x27;t a person who would be there. Does that kind of make sense? That&#x27;s a little bit We&#x27;re going to have to untangle a little bit of things here.</p>\n<p>Um, I read that more carefully. Here&#x27;s how I summarized it in my own notes here. Lifestyle trumps discipline. Instead of setting a surface level goal and hyping yourself to remain disciplined for a few weeks, consider creating a lifestyle that makes the outcome you desire uh much easier if or even unavoidable, right? So, I think that&#x27;s what when I when I read this closely, I think that&#x27;s what he says is lifestyle is better than discipline. All right? He doesn&#x27;t tell you to do that yet. That&#x27;s what the rest of the advice is about. All right. Here&#x27;s idea two. Pull this up here. The way he his title here is you aren&#x27;t where you want to be</p>\n<p>because you don&#x27;t want to be there. You can&#x27;t do this with the English language, Jesse. There&#x27;s a lot of negatives and negative negatives and okay, it&#x27;s a little circular, but I read this carefully. Here&#x27;s my summary of idea two. Your behaviors follow your desires. Our behavior isn&#x27;t goal oriented. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m using his words here. It&#x27;s teological, meaning we do things because we want certain outcomes. For example, we procrastinate not because we lack discipline, but because we want to quote protect ourselves from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing our</p>\n<p>work and quote, you stay in the dead-end job because you want the security and predictability, etc., etc. So what he&#x27;s saying there Jesse is that um we are doing things because for certain outcomes we tell ourselves we do things to accomplish certain goals but actually our behaviors are often not just us being undisiplined or not having a goal. there&#x27;s a the behaviors we don&#x27;t like often do have a goal that&#x27;s desirable to us. That for like a lot of people, it&#x27;s desirable not to work on these bigger projects because uh we don&#x27;t want to be</p>\n<p>in a a position to actually be assessed and be rejected or we actually like the security of this bad job. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not interested. So, he&#x27;s saying um behaviors follow desires. You have to think about what you actually desire in your life is more important than like what goals do you have. You should have let me help write this. I feel like I&#x27;m a clue. &gt;&gt; The whole time I was thinking, is this the stuff you were teaching those Dartmouth kids when you did that summer program? &gt;&gt; I taught those kids how to write. All right. Number three. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s words. You aren&#x27;t where you want to be because you&#x27;re afraid to be there. You aren&#x27;t</p>\n<p>where you want to be because you&#x27;re afraid to be there. Okay. Uh here&#x27;s how I summarized that in my own notes. We protect the status quo for the sake of psychological consistency. Uh, so here&#x27;s this is literally in my notes, Jesse. I don&#x27;t fully understand this one. I tried to understand this one. It got a little bit complicated, but my best read is you build an identity as you grow up and then you will go through a lot to protect it for the sake of psychological consistency, even if that identity is harmful. So, you sort of build up an understanding of yourself, which not necessarily a</p>\n<p>positive one. Um, but we want to whatever our self-standing is, we want to protect it. And we might protect it by sabotaging goals that on paper might be like, hey, that&#x27;s really good and ambitious and something you should do, but it might challenge this identity we have about ourselves. Like, I&#x27;m no good at that. I&#x27;m not smart. I people don&#x27;t respect me. And you don&#x27;t want to lose that identity. So, you you don&#x27;t pursue goals. So, there&#x27;s like a psychology there that&#x27;s important. All right. Idea four, uh, co summarizes it this way. The life you want lies within a specific level of</p>\n<p>mind. All right. So again, here&#x27;s my notes here, Jesse. I wrote, I got fully lost in this one. Um, I&#x27;m going to read to you verbatim from a a a paragraph just so you get a sense of what I was dealing with here trying to summarize this one. This is me quoting, &quot;I&#x27;ve talked about these many times and synthesized them into my own human 3.0 no model and various AI prompts to uncover your level of development and a path forward. PN open a tab to read after if you like in PNS, but here&#x27;s the 8020 of the nine stages of ego development as a refresher because</p>\n<p>repetition helps reveal things you didn&#x27;t notice before and there are new people reading these letters. He then presents this table which will make it all clear to you, Jesse. I This is a real thing. My god. Um, if you&#x27;re listening instead of just watching, I have never seen a more complicated. Is this a chart? It&#x27;s colors. It&#x27;s words. It&#x27;s quadrants. It looks like a little bit like you threw up Froot Loops, I guess, onto um like the printer test page. I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t</p>\n<p>pull this apart. Uh, I&#x27;ll just read various words on here. states of consciousness, lines of development, types, interactive vision logic, integrative vision logic, uh personalistic relativistic, individualistic pluralistic, four out of five, radical relativism rules, single system view. I don&#x27;t know. I I don&#x27;t know if this is something that uh that Dan put together or something that someone else did that he&#x27;s referencing. I didn&#x27;t really understand this one. So, let&#x27;s move on. All right. Idea five. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s summary. Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of</p>\n<p>life. All right, that&#x27;s very clear. I appreciate that. Um, he goes on to talk about cybernetics. Cybernetics is, you know, this is Norbert Weiner in the 1940s and 1950s talking about the merging of electronic mechanical machines and humans. So, you kind of like have feedback loops between like humans and machines and allows you to do something that a human by itself couldn&#x27;t do or a machine by itself couldn&#x27;t do. He was inspired by working on uh during the war like things for helping to aim anti-aircraft guns at fighter jets or not fighter jets, bombers and stuff like that. Uh so he references cybernetics to illustrate a model of goal pursuit where you keep</p>\n<p>making adjustments to your path along the way to keep coming back towards the right way forward. This is the photo. This is a useful photo. This is like a classic cybernetic thing. You constantly make adjustments. So you you kind of leave the right course but then you adjust and then that you go off the other way, you adjust again. If you keep making adjustments, you make progress where towards you&#x27;re trying to get. Um, here&#x27;s his summary of the steps for a cybernetic approach to trying to get somewhere you want to get. Have a goal, act towards that goal, sense where you are, compare it to that goal, and act again based on that feedback. So, he&#x27;s</p>\n<p>saying, and I think this is very pragmatic, you need to constantly like assess where you are and adjust. That&#x27;s how you make progress towards something. You&#x27;re not just going to have the perfect plan and just follow it and then two years later you&#x27;re there. You have to constantly be like, where am I? I&#x27;ve made some progress, but I veered off the goal. So, what adjustments do I make for going forward? Keep doing that and you&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll be moving in the general the general right direction. All right, idea piece of six. Here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s summary. How to launch into a completely new life in one day. So now he&#x27;s going to pull together a lot of these ideas. Um I went through this and I summarized there&#x27;s three parts. Now he&#x27;s trying to</p>\n<p>summarize how do you put all these things into action your life and there&#x27;s three parts. One for what you do in the morning, one for what you do throughout the day and what one for what you do at the end of the day for trying to put all these ideas into practice. So, what he recommends briefly is during the morning you do a vision and anti-vision exercise where you spend 15 to 20 minutes reflecting on both what you like and don&#x27;t like about the path that you&#x27;re on. Like what do I want out of my life? What do I want my life to be? What would my life be like if I don&#x27;t do those things? This is like classic psychological uh possible future comparison. It&#x27;s very powerful actually.</p>\n<p>All right. So, you you you spend 15 20 minutes. He gives you some questions to answer. Then part two during the day he says you should interrupt autopilot to regularly ask yourself questions like what am I avoiding right now by doing what I&#x27;m doing and he says actually he has a list of these questions put them into calendar events so that they can pop up with notifications and just remind you like stop whatever you&#x27;re doing and ask this question so he wants to break the idea of autopilot and keep you much more conscious about how you&#x27;re spending your time. Part three at the end of the day in the evening he wants you to synthesize any insight. So,</p>\n<p>integrate any insights you had during the day into your understanding of your identity. There&#x27;s some time here for self-reflection. For example, he says, &quot;Write a single sentence that captures what you&#x27;re building towards knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.&quot; Um, then he goes on and says, &quot;You should have multi-scale goals, which of course I&#x27;m a fan of. You have daily goal, monthly goal, and one-year scale goals that you can be keeping track of.&quot; Finally, idea seven, pull it up here. This is Look how long how much I have to scroll. So, it&#x27;s a long article. All right. Idea seven, turn your life into a video game. So here he&#x27;s saying you can</p>\n<p>gify some of this advice. Um I&#x27;m going to quote from him directly here. Your because I didn&#x27;t quite understand this, but maybe this will make sense to you, Jesse. Your vision is how you win, at least until the game evolves. Your anti- vision is what&#x27;s at stake. What happens if you lose or give up? Your one-year goal is the mission. This is your sole priority in life. Your one-mon project is the boss fight, how you gain XP and acquire loot. Your daily levers are the quest, the daily process that unlocks new opportunities. Your constraints are the rules, the limitations that encourage creativity. Okay, I get this.</p>\n<p>Like you have um constraints in your life about things you do or don&#x27;t do. Each day you have certain things you do to like make that day better. On the factor of the month, you&#x27;re moving towards these one-mon goals which move you closer to your one-year mission. And you have a vision and anti- vision to help you know this is what I want and this is what I want to avoid. And he&#x27;s talking about you can kind of think of it like a video game. All right. So, there you go. I want to start by asking the question, why did this get so popular? Why did this rack up 173 million views and counting? Here&#x27;s my assessment. And Jess, you can tell me if this makes sense to you. In</p>\n<p>self-help literature, there&#x27;s two different camps, two different types of self-help literature. The practical and the psychological, right? Um, so the the practical it&#x27;s it&#x27;s usually about like here is like really specific advice for achieving specific goals. Like in the world of books you might think about like James Clear&#x27;s atomic habits. It&#x27;s like really specific advice for how you make progress on habits or maybe online you would think of like classic Ali Abdal. You know he&#x27;ll really talk about specific setups or configurations of your technology to make progress on certain goals. The other genre is</p>\n<p>psychological which is much more about the psychology behind your motivations and your actions. So, it&#x27;s about change your brain and you&#x27;re not going to get in the way of things that you want to do. So, in the book world, you might think about like Mark Manson&#x27;s book, uh, The Subtle Art, or Mel Robbins&#x27;s new book, The Let Them theory. These are psychological self-help books. Bnee Brown, I think, would fall in here as well. Less about step by step and more about changing your mind so the psychology doesn&#x27;t get in the way of action. So, these are both two genres that both have major bestsellers. I mean, right now, if you look at the</p>\n<p>bestseller list, James Clear and Mel Robbins are right there. All right. I think what this essay did is it combined practical and psychological self-help. He has like practical ideas. You want to do this, put these events on your calendar, gify it this way, have goals at these levels. But he also talked a lot about the psychology, the psychology that&#x27;s getting in your way, that&#x27;s preventing you from making progress. Why? What&#x27;s going on in your brain? He talked about both and he put them together and then he layered on top of that</p>\n<p>references and terminology that&#x27;s relevant to Ginz. I think that was a pretty powerful mix. Now, as you could tell by me going through it, I mean, look, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in my, you know, 40s. I&#x27;ve been a professional writer my whole life. I write for the New Yorker. I&#x27;m a writing snob. The writing is a little hard to follow sometimes, okay? Like, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s there&#x27;s ideas in there that haven&#x27;t fully been fleshed out. Some of them I really are and some of them I you can&#x27;t do that to the English language. This is referencing this this and this. But you put that aside and this is Dan Co&#x27;s project. Let&#x27;s talk</p>\n<p>about psychology and practical. Put them together and in lingo that makes sense to a generation on Tik Tok and Instagram and YouTube idioms of speech and that type of movement, right? That kind of like you keep moving and say lots of things. Not not like our generation of carefully crafted writing. When I look at it that way, I say this does not hijack ambition. I think especially for a younger person, this would be useful. You start thinking about your mindset. You start thinking about practical advice. I mean, I think the system in here is pretty complicated. I think that rainbow the Froot Loops vomit chart is going to not</p>\n<p>help be that helpful. I don&#x27;t know what the hell&#x27;s going on there. But in general, like, oh, I need to think about uh my psychology. That&#x27;s important. The practical advice seems pretty reasonable to me. vision and anti-vision planning. It&#x27;s is actually incredibly effective. Make really clear what&#x27;ll happen if you don&#x27;t change and make really clear where you could get if you do. That&#x27;s very powerful in motivating change. This idea that you need to change your understanding of yourself before you can make progress on certain goals. I think that&#x27;s interesting. The idea that people who do really important things often they&#x27;ve set up</p>\n<p>their lives in such a way that like making progress is something that of course they do. It&#x27;s not a fight. It&#x27;s not a willpower discipline fight. is you got to change your life, not just change your goals. I think that&#x27;s important. Tracking things, having goals at multiple levels, I think that&#x27;s useful as well. So, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m going to if we have to choose hijack support, I think this leans for the support side. It&#x27;s not my cup of tea, but it wasn&#x27;t written for me. And uh hopefully I don&#x27;t know. I I think that could be pretty useful advice. What What&#x27;s your take, Jesse? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still flabbergasted about the 175 million views. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s a lot of people. I mean I</p>\n<p>maybe they get they get seen a lot of times. I don&#x27;t really know how that works. &gt;&gt; And I kept I keep on thinking about this with your episode earlier a couple weeks ago about Substack too. &gt;&gt; Um yeah and the fact that he &gt;&gt; and then you mentioned the essay thing &gt;&gt; and he did this on Twitter which is interesting as opposed to like on Substack or something like that. &gt;&gt; I wonder if he has a Substack. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know man. This generation is not big on Substacks. There&#x27;s 8,000 replies. I I was reading through some of them and they were just like people like Yeah. It&#x27;s interesting. You know, sometimes you just catch the virality um genieing the bottle. Partially what&#x27;s happening</p>\n<p>with this essay is what we&#x27;re doing here at large. Everybody is doing segments on the essay itself. So, it&#x27;s getting like huge like after aftermarket. &gt;&gt; Yeah. To put in perspective, like the Super Bowl in a couple weeks will probably get 110 million. &gt;&gt; But that&#x27;s people watching for four hours. Yeah. As opposed to a Twitter view. So, I don&#x27;t know how to translate that to real people. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Maybe it is though because international, right? Like this is all around the world. People could look at it. Anyways, I think it&#x27;s amazing how many people seen it. And I&#x27;m not upset that this thing is viral. Again, not my</p>\n<p>completely my cup of tea, but there&#x27;s good ideas in there. And the reason why it&#x27;s successful is not because of some weirdness or griiness. I think that&#x27;s an interesting merging of psychological practical and jinz into a a certain um potent stew. It&#x27;s a good time to announce my new book aimed at Jinzy where I will also call it how to make What did my What did my son say today? I completely misunderstood it. He said like, &quot;Oh, my my Magic the Gathering deck is now busted.&quot; And I I was like, &quot;Um, oh, sorry. So,</p>\n<p>you&#x27;re going to have to like get better cards or whatever.&quot; He&#x27;s like, &quot;No, that means good.&quot; So, I don&#x27;t know. So, I&#x27;m going to call it how to make your life busted. Escape mid and get to B from basic to busted and fix your entire life in 17 minutes. See what I&#x27;m doing there? More extreme. And I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know any other references. So, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s going to be. Lessons from Mr. Beast. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know. All right. So, there we go.</p>\n<p>Uh, that&#x27;s our practices segment. Hey, if you like this video, I think you&#x27;ll really like this one as well.</p>", "chapters_count": 1}
