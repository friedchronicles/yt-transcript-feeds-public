In this episode, Cal argues that this is both an issue and an opportunity. The fact we can\u2019t watch full movies indicates the impact of digital tools on our brains is worse than we assumed. But in this problem we also find a solution: maybe teaching ourselves to become better movie watchers can be the first step to reclaiming our own minds. Cal then dissects a viral AI essay that seems to have everyone worried (spoiler: Cal\u2019s not impressed), reads a reader note about social media and the Olympics and gives an update on his next book project.\n\nDownload my FREE Deep Life Guide HERE: https://bit.ly/3QBIcug\n\nListen to Episode Here:  https://www.thedeeplife.com/listen/\n\nGet your questions answered by Cal!
