James Talarico from the air, Stephen Colbert had some words for Trump\u2019s FCC Chair Brendan Carr. Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov discuss corporate media \u201cbending the knee\u201d to the Trump administration, on Raging Moderates.", "transcript_html": "<p><strong>[00:00]</strong></p>\n<p>James Talarico, the\ncharismatic Texas state\nrepresentative, was scheduled to be interviewed by Stephen Colbert\non his show this past\nMonday night. But at the last\nminute, CBS told the hosts that the interview\nwould not air and that\nhe shouldn't talk about it on the show. Colbert doesn't appear\nto be complying. He called out\nFCC Chair Brendan Carr\nby name. On January\n21st of this year, a letter\nwas released by FCC chairman and smug bowling\npin Brendan Carr. Well, sir, you're\nchairman of the FCC, so FCC you. It appears to be\nanother example</p>\n<p>where corporate\nmedia is responding\nto the Trump administration\u2019s\npolicies, or... desires,\nif you will. They're just ghoulish\nat this point, and they're more\ninterested in the tiny fights, I feel like,\nthan the big ones. Or maybe\nthey feel like if they do the tiny\nfights, then we won't notice\nthe big ones. But I feel like this is just\ngoing to be another L for them. It's a really bad look for these\nnetworks to constantly\nbe bending the knee, and you don't get\nanything in return. That is the lesson we have seen\nthus far. You are not better\noff by doing this.</p>\n<p>You're\njust losing money or brand value, which translates\ninto money. I think\nit's important we're clear on what actually happened\nhere. Paramount is trying to get regulatory approval\nfor a merger, and the FCC chair\nsends a letter, not even a rule,\nbut a letter about equal time, which is a ruse\nfor censorship. And CBS lawyers\nimmediately spike a guest\nbooking on a show. That has three months\nleft on the air anyway.</p>\n<p>That's not regulatory\nor legal caution. That's a protection\npayment. And here, in terms of that payment,\nthe currency is editorial\nindependence, and they spent it\non the cheap. Meanwhile, Colbert\ndoes exactly the right thing, defies\nthe order. Talks about the defiance\non air, posts the interview\non YouTube, and the interview that CBS\ntried to kill will get more views\nin any interview they actually aired\nthis month. They're not\nsilencing speech, which is their\nobjective. They've accidentally\nturbocharged it. The folks working on\nthe Talarico</p>\n<p>campaign\nfor Senate are like, \u201cwho do we\nsend the flowers to?\u201d</p>"}
