Becker discusses METR\u2019s publicized work such as the time horizon chart (task difficulty measured in human-time at 50% reliability), how tasks are selected and constrained (economic relevance, auto-grading, non-messy scope), and why time horizon is often misinterpreted as how long agents run. They cover Opus 4.5\u2019s perceived jump, challenges redoing developer productivity RCTs as workflows and adoption change, and why current models aren\u2019t yet catastrophically dangerous while discontinuous capability gains remain possible if R&amp;D loops fully automate. Becker also summarizes research linking compute growth slowdowns to slower capability progress, describes his Manifold trading story driven by a charity market he could influence, notes mixed social value of prediction markets, and previews METR\u2019s 2026 plans, safeguards work, and hiring.\n\n00:00 What METR Does\n00:39 Podcast Intro\n02:53 Threat Models Shift\n03:33 Time Horizon Origin\n04:56 Choosing Eval Tasks\n06:25 Messy Real Work\n08:10 HCAST And RE Bench\n09:13 Human Time Misread\n11:37 Opus 4.5 Surprise\n14:27 Redoing Uplift RCTs\n18:52 Measuring Productivity\n20:55 Why Not Dangerous Yet\n22:22 Capability Explosion\n26:23 Benchmarks Miss Tail\n28:08 Beyond One Number\n29:50 Compute Slows Progress\n30:47 Algorithms Need Compute\n32:45 Lab Spend and Visibility\n34:57 Cluster Timelines and Shipping\n36:44 Prediction Markets and Models\n38:10 Manifold Trading Story\n39:52 Ethics and Insider Info\n43:04 Beyond Benchmarks Evals\n48:29 Harnesses and Scaffolding\n51:39 METER Roadmap and Hiring\n54:24 Karaoke and Human Voice\n55:53 Closing Thoughts", "transcript_html": "<p><em>No transcript available for this video.</em></p>", "cleanup_applied": false, "cleanup_reason": "no_transcript"}
