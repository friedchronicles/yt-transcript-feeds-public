Did &gt;&gt; what do you think about that? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s fascinating, &gt;&gt; right? That woman is loyal. &gt;&gt; I like a lot of the people running in that race. &gt;&gt; Well, cuz literally everybody in New York City is running in that race. &gt;&gt; Are you running? [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, I&#x27;m not. But I&#x27;m interested &gt;&gt; in running. &gt;&gt; No, I would be a terrible candidate. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m curious to see how much her endorsement actually matters. But she&#x27;s a prolific fundraiser, but I also don&#x27;t know that he needs it. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;ll be very interesting to see how seriously he takes this. I wonder if Pelosi had a conversation with him that was like, &quot;Is this real or is this a</p>\n<p>thing that you&#x27;re going to do for a little bit and then you&#x27;re going to go back to Vanity Fair and Tik Tocking from the laundry room in your building?&quot; My friend lives in the building and says he sees him in the laundry room and he&#x27;ll be like, &quot;You want to be in the video?&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;No, just want to do the laundry.</p>", "chapters_count": 0}
