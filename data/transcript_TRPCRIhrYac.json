Oh, this is Kevin from \"The Office.\" Yeah, yeah. Eric Glyman is the\nco-founder and CEO of Ramp, the corporate card and\nfinance automation platform. Founded in 2019, Ramp has\ntaken the industry by storm. Oh, cheers. Cheers. Can you describe maybe a good framing, just the Ramp business today? What's the biggest part of the business in terms of where you make money? What are the new growth lines? Any metrics you can share on the scale? Alex and I have a million questions, but maybe you can start by\njust framing it up for us.</p>\n<p>Yeah, of course. So first, just the pace\nthat this has come together has been pretty remarkable. Seven years, yeah. You know? I think by the time we\nwere, six years and change, the company had passed over\na billion a year in revenue. The largest portion of that is card. And so, that might be a classic kind of interchange-based model. But behind it\u2014 So this is people, in their business they have spend cards, everyone walking around the\ncompany has a Ramp card. And you run interchange on those.</p>\n<p>That's right. Next, you can think about\nbill payments and software. Software, it's a two-something-year-old business line, just about two years and some months. That's over 100 million a year business line in and of itself. And that can be advanced\nfunctionality to maybe manage lots of entities, to automate\naspects of accounting, maybe aspects of\nprocurement, bill payments. So this can be sending checks, wires, ACH and that's predominantly a float</p>\n<p>as well in some cases foreign\nexchange transaction business. Treasury. That's a product that is about a year old, several billion dollars of deposits. Some of that is checking-like products. Some of that is more of an investment and money ladder type product. And then the last, the\nother ones are procurement and then travel, which\nis a bit of an in-kind. And what's been so interesting\nis that if you break down and look towards maybe let's\nsay contribution profit, gross profit of the business, a few years ago it would've been</p>\n<p>90 plus percent card. I think by the end of\nthis year, the second, third, fourth, fifth lines of business will comprise and aggregate the majority of Ramp's business. And so, it's evolved into\nthis platform by which if you're trying to operate your company, it's just a lot more efficient. You spend less. I think\npeople know Ramp for, we help the average\ncompany cut their expenses by about 5% per year. The thing that's been really fascinating</p>\n<p>is people are starting to use\nthese products in aggregate. Not only are they not paying for five, six sets of point solutions, but they're also not wasting time. They're growing faster. The average customer last year on Ramp grew their revenue by, I think it was 16%, which compared to, in the United States, the average business\u2014 Much higher than that.</p>\n<p><strong>[03:01]</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I think it's 5% in the US. And so, in some sense\nwhat we're trying to do is be not just a better platform, but a better, almost kind of\ndigital brain for organizations to allocate resources and\nmake sure spend is not wasted. Yeah. So, you start by selling, say, spend cards into a business. The CFO likes it, the employees like it, and then that gives you\npermission to go sell some of this other functionality. And so it's kind of a classic\nmulti-product cross sell. Is it always starting with spend cards</p>\n<p>or do you now have multiple front doors into the business? It's been the big story of the past year. I think there were, over the last quarter, thousands of businesses that\ncame in just for bill payments. There's accounting firms\nthat are becoming into, they say, \"We're a Ramp shop here if you want to work with us. We'll bring in bill payments, treasury...\" We use Ramp to go power that and they can manage 10, 100, 200 clients all through one platform.</p>\n<p>And we're excited. I mean, probably the fastest growing line of business is procurement. Or, they're single\nclients that are looking to kind of bring in and do full-scale purchase orders across, whether it's single or a dozen plus entities,\nall the way through. And so, that's been the really fun story of the past year. Do you have a view on\nwhat the right policy is for employee spend within a business? I love that you ask this, yeah. 37signals or someone will say, \"Companies are so lame.</p>\n<p>you just give everyone a credit card and trust people and it's fine.\" And then meanwhile,\nlarge companies are like, \"Well, this hotel is in a Tier 2 city and therefore there's this dollar limit and it must be booked 14 days in advance.\" And so, you see companies\noperate at really two ends of the spectrum in terms of how much flexibility they give people. What is correct for a company,\nor does it just vary by size? I love this question. And the interesting part,\nif you really kind of dig into Ramp's businesses we have ways of back testing and actually understanding</p>\n<p>based on how strict your policy is, how things are running. Does that have an impact on how much time your employees are,\nlet's say doing expenses, how quickly you're growing. And you can start to actually compare based off of the operating\nhygiene of the company\u2026 What are end margins? What is a pace of growth\nthat occurs at the company? And I bring this back to what\u2014 So you can do a correlational study between expense policies and company growth.</p>\n<p>Yeah. And look, it's pretty interesting. I mean, the first, there's an aspect of, in most companies, particularly\nhigh growth companies, it tends to resemble something closer to the \"no rules rules\" Netflix approach of we're going to trust but\nverify and shine a light on it. Spend tends to be reasonably permissive. But then part of the\nbreakthrough of the past year</p>\n<p><strong>[06:02]</strong></p>\n<p>is you could basically\ntake an expense policy, let's say it's written in plain English. \"If the flight is more than five hours, you can take business. If it's under...\" Things that\nwould've been horrible to go and have your managers\ngo and verify this stuff, now you can run that through an LLM. I think that we're processing\nover 100,000 expenses a day that are being reviewed agentically. This is a very fast-growing\nsubset of the business. So you give the Ramp agent this company's expense\npolicy and then it applies it</p>\n<p>to the transactions\nthat are coming through. Exactly. And so you can start to do things like, I think about the episode\nyou'd had with Susan Li. It was incredibly instructive where, she sort of says, it would feel so silly and it's not a great use\nof my time in some sense to be a very expensive machine\nlearning algorithm to do, to review expenses. But yet somehow a lot\nof people in companies are reduced to that\nthanks to Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules around it. Now you can have an agent\nfunctionally that does that, that takes that aspect of the job.</p>\n<p>And so, it has access\nto the full set of data that you would, all the\ntransaction-related metadata, the receipt data, the timing\ndata, the policy data. It then can go in real-time review. Was this in or out? Can have the full audit trail\nexplaining its reasoning. And today it's over 99% accurate, which turns out it's much\nmore accurate than people are. So people don't know the expense policy and expenses are pretty automated. And I find this thing\nsuper interesting, in part because I don't think it\nshould be anyone's job</p>\n<p>to go and review people's expenses, but somehow, while it's in no one's JD, the law kind of requires\neveryone to waste an hour of their time every month,\nif you're a manager. And does the law allow for\nit to be reviewed agentically and then just signed off on by the human? It does, yeah. The goal of this is separation of duties. That you yourself are not reviewing your own expenses. There needs to be a set of procedures that govern and actually are effective\nthrough the action of, okay, the rule says this.</p>\n<p>Did you take some steps to do this? It can be a system\u2014 Yeah, you can't self-certify. The funny thing is that, I\nmean, one way of doing this\u2026 Actually, we used to do this is why not just post your expense reports in the public eye, right? So, and the reason to do this\nis actually it could go wrong. You could say, \"I'm going to spend... You stay at the Four Seasons, I'm going stay at the Five Seasons.\" You could go that direction. But what you actually\nwant is a moral code. It's like, if you were the owner of the business it is your own money.\nYes. So if you were staying\nat the Five Seasons, I've just made that hotel chain up, it's like, you're\u2014</p>\n<p>Sounds pretty nice. You're stealing from yourself,\nwhy would you do that? The problem is that once you get to tens of thousands of people, how do you impose that moral code? And actually like the two tent poles that you just\nmentioned, they're both bad. Because if you have to\nstay at a crappy hotel and you're about to sign a\ntwo million dollar contract and you didn't get any\nsleep. It's the Motel 6 and you take a two-hour taxi, it's like, all right, you\nsaved the company money.</p>\n<p><strong>[09:03]</strong></p>\n<p>That does not make sense. Stay at the Four Seasons. But you can't really embody that in, \"if this, then that.\" Because what you want is this moral code. Like that's what you want. And like how do you actually instill that? And there's almost a\nbehavioral psychology way, which is like, we'll just show what people are spending. If you're at the top of the leaderboard, we might trust but verify\nand verify a lot more. But that's the hard thing to do and actually preserve\nas the company goes from the founder, to the founder\nplus the founder's brother to many, many more people. How do you keep that same esprit de corps or this informal code.</p>\n<p>I think it comes back to\u2026 What was the name of the movie? \"12 Angry Men,\" I think it was where, as you're watching the film, you get some level of detail and someone seems very guilty. It's a dead shut case. And as more evidence emerges, you realize actually,\nthis may be different. And you need more context in order to arrive at\nmaybe a moral conclusion. Did it relate to closing a project? How does it relate to an outcome</p>\n<p>that maybe you'll see\nemerge one month, two months after you stayed at the Five Seasons and closed the deal that\nchanged the company, whatever the example is. I would argue in favor of tools that have more context,\nthat do more jobs of work. Because not only can you\ndo the narrow job better, but you can start to get at the answer of what actually is\nright for shareholders. Where should we be allocating capital? It's so interesting to hear because every company\napproaches this differently. Like I'm on the board of Wise</p>\n<p>and you know, Kristo\nflies coach everywhere, everybody flies, that's just the policy but it might be penny-wise, pound-foolish. Again, not for me to say, but I also really admire\nthe corporate code. It's just like you,\nactually, that is cultural. It's kind of weird to say expenses are\ncultural, but they are. For sure. Yeah, it's shared\u2014 Shared belief system. It's a shared belief system. It's like, what is the\nculture of the company? You talked about your\nexpansion into Bill Pay. It seems like bill payment</p>\n<p>has proven, over the past 40 years, uniquely resistant to\nautomation and modernization. If you look at how a typical business pays their rent or if you\norder a keg of Guinness, you'll get a PDF emailed to you by some person who has\na relationship with you and there will be bank account details which hopefully are correct. And you send a payment to those. And even bill payment products, you guys have a bunch of technology here,</p>\n<p>but it's like, we scan the\nPDF in an automated way or we ensure that the bank account details weren't mistyped or something. But it's kind of \"putting\na little bit of lipstick on the pig\" of the whole system being super antiquated. Why is the system so antiquated when it comes to bill\npayment in particular? I think this is some of\nwhat Alex was bringing up.</p>\n<p><strong>[12:05]</strong></p>\n<p>It's the constraints of programming things in an \"if this, then that\"\nkind of world are very heavy. There's a lot of complexity. And when you think about the nuance and algorithms that govern why do companies spend money\nunder some circumstances, how hard it can be to record. I wouldn't overlook... Let's say that you're a manufacturer and you're buying some asset\nwhich you're going to use for five years and it's\ngoing to depreciate. It's a very different accounting treatment versus I'm buying a\npay-as-you-go SaaS app.</p>\n<p>All the complexities around that might govern whether or\nnot you decide to spend. And then finally, once\nyou get all this detail, how do you review this and decide where to allocate\nyour next marginal dollar is very complicated. But many systems are in place upgraded despite the fact that\nthat's pretty complex. So credit cards started with no real-time authorization system, which is crazy. And you just hoped that\nthey were good for\u2014 Carbon copy. Exactly. The machine\nwith the pleasing sound.</p>\n<p>They'd do great in the\ncurrent ASMR environment. That's true. But then they added, you could call up and get an authorization and then they obviously added to the current systems we know where\u2014 The modem, you forgot the modem. Exactly. And then the modem. And so, in place credit\ncards were upgraded with much better capabilities. And similarly, if you look at checks and how they work, even though we think of\nchecks as antiquated, it used to be the case\nthat physical checks had to be flown all around the country to be physically settled. And then there was the Check 21 Act in, what was it, the year 2000?</p>\n<p>Where they said a scan\nof a check is good enough and so they could be\ndigitized by the banks and then shredded. And then there was the, you can take a photo of\na check with your phone. And so we've managed to take this super old-timey check system and despite the fact it's super old-timey, in some ways it has actually\nbeen meaningfully upgraded. And if you looked at the bill\npay system from the outside, you would say we should\nhave DNS for companies. So rather than a company like sending you their\nbank account details, you should look them up in\nsome central clearinghouse. And that way you confirm that\nyou're not being phished. A lot of spear-phishing\nattacks work that way.</p>\n<p>Although you referenced this. So there's actually an indifference point that you can graph. If interest rates go up high enough, if I send you a check, which is like a paper mail check and that takes five days and hopefully the USPS goes on strike for two more weeks so\nI've got the postmark. I actually benefit\u2026 It's\nactually cheaper for me. You legally paid, right? It's crazy. No, it's crazy. This is the problem. Like credit cards, everybody... I am in the store, I want the TV. You want to sell me the TV. We both want this done right away. And in the knuckle-crunching, ASMR,</p>\n<p>carbon-copy days, they might not have been\nwilling to sell that to me because they didn't know if\nI was good for the money. They'd never seen me before. And the interesting thing is that AR and AP are almost\nan adversarial process. You mentioned this. What do you want to do as a controller? Well, you want to pay as late as possible and you want to collect\nas early as possible. And then you have this\nweird thing where checks, it's not just an accident</p>\n<p><strong>[15:06]</strong></p>\n<p>that they stick around for a long time. It's like there's a financial\nincentive for one party. So that's true on payment\ntiming, I agree with that but there are some things that\nare just a dead weight loss, like the ability to fat-finger a bank account. No one benefits from that. Everyone has a horrible time if that happens.\nNo, that Nigerian guy. There's some people that benefit. Nigerian princes. Let's think of everyone. I will posit that many networks have been upgraded in place. But somehow the loose\nnetwork of businesses paying each other via PDF invoices has proven very resistant\nto in-place upgrades.</p>\n<p>Also, I love your notion of DNS for payments or for expenses. So, I don't know if you saw this, Google wanted to issue a 100-year bond. Yes. So, why is that interesting? Imagine that I am owed money by Google. I am one of the small\nbusinesses that you reference. Their job is to pay me\nas late as possible. Yes. They can borrow money for a hundred years at like 3% or whatever it is, cheaper than the US government probably. T plus a hundred, yeah. I mean it's a little more expensive than the US government,\nbut they are borrowing...</p>\n<p>That's crazy. I can borrow money at 20%, but why do I need to borrow money? Because Google's paying me late. Those jerks. So, I should be able to borrow money kind of at the rate at which\nGoogle is borrowing money because my AR... My AR is their AP. But the problem is, unless\nyou put all this together, you would just look at me and you're like, \"Well, you're just a little schmuck. I'm going to charge you 18%.\" It's like, yeah, but it's Google. They could borrow money at T plus</p>\n<p>whatever, you know, SOFR plus a hundred. 100%. That's not fair. But the only way to really solve that is with more data and\nactually entangling... Not entangling, but just kind of connecting these things together. For sure. What's your vision for once AI is doing a lot\nof software engineering, what does that look like in\nthree or four years time? Is the competitive equilibrium similar, but the expectations for the amount of software and\nfunctionality businesses are shipping is much higher? Are software teams similar\nlooking, different looking?</p>\n<p>Again, you're doing a\nlot of AI engineering. What does the future hold? It's all blurring. It's totally crazy. There's a designer shipping code. Marketing at Ramp reports into our CTO Karim, my co-founder who's doing some of\nlike the best marketing I've ever experienced and seen. We have customer support agents like shipping code to production too. I just think that the\nhalf-life of you see a problem to how long it takes for you to go fix it</p>\n<p>and do something about it\nis shrinking immensely. Or if you want to change\na color of a button, you can just say, \"Hey at Ramp Inspect, can you change the color of this button?\" And it goes and spins it up and it does it within minutes. It verifies and validates it. And so, I actually think in some sense,</p>\n<p><strong>[18:07]</strong></p>\n<p>these classic barriers that software businesses had are clearly going to erode. Yes but, there's the old joke of \"It's much more fun to\nwrite code than read code,\" which explains a lot of\nsoftware engineer's behavior. And it becomes easier\nto change the button. Is that another instance\nof it being more fun to write code than read code? Where lines of code are a\nliability and not an asset because they're something you have to reckon with. And so, are companies\nat some level incurring some tech debt now where\nthey're adding a bunch of code, which will maybe be harder\nto reason with later?</p>\n<p>Or do you just get bailed out by the models getting better? It's really interesting. And by the way, one of\nthe other interesting sub-conversations I'm hearing a lot, too, is when you think about where\ntech debt comes from, there's a set of conditions and trade-offs you make, you write things in a discreet and deterministic way. Under these circumstances,\nfollow this code path. Under this circumstance,\nfollow this other one. In a world where there's LLMs and the models\nthemselves are improving, I think it's entirely\npossible that the way</p>\n<p>that code is written is you say, \"Here's what I'm solving for. Under these kinds of conditions,\nhere's what I want to occur. Go write the code that\ndrives this outcome.\" And maybe with the models\nsuch as they are today can get it done in sort of a spaghetti code written fashion. But it kind of works even\nthough it's some kind of Rube Goldberg machine underneath the hood. But as these models get much smarter, you might write your code base\nin such a way where you say, \"Every year, rewrite the underlying code, but here's the outcome I can drive.\"</p>\n<p>And today you accomplish\nmy outcome 90% of the time, 95, 98, 99, 100. And do you just have kind of self-healing and writing code all the way through? And this notion of like\nunderlying code does goes away because we're writing things\nin this different manner. Obviously, there's real\nconditions in which that's not going to\u2026 That won't occur. Like, if you're writing\ncode that needs to have, four nines of accuracy and uptime, like that's probably not\nthe methods you're using. But if you're like a\ngrowth engineering team, that's probably what you're doing today</p>\n<p>if you're kind of on the\nleading edge of this stuff. And so, I find this\nstuff very fascinating. And when I think about the deeper implications of this stuff, I think that if you are\ncompleting this small amount of cognitive work... Let's say you are an expense app. The spend has occurred, it needs to go get the... Write it down somewhere\nand get someone's approval. And that's all the knowledge\nwork that you're doing. That's very few tokens in\norder to accomplish that,</p>\n<p>both to create the infrastructure\nin order to facilitate it, like that probably evaporates. Anyone can probably custom\nwrite that kind of app. Whereas if you're doing\nmuch deeper kind of work, such to underwrite a company, provide financing, automate\nareas of accounting. I think the fitness function for companies</p>\n<p><strong>[21:09]</strong></p>\n<p>becomes can you actually\ndo things in such a way where even if you could\nspend tokens on it, it would take more tokens\nto create the thing or do that work than the\nsystem maybe that you've built to kind of drive that outcome. I just think the rules of what it means to be a software company are changing. I think network effects\nand what you're building is more important than ever. Like, if you think about\nthe classic set of moats that are there, I think\nthat this question of where are their moats in a world where... I like Dario's way of putting this.</p>\n<p>If you have a country of geniuses\u2014 Data center, yeah. Living somewhere and they're writing code and they're incentivized\nto compete with you, too. If you're not really following what are the classic four moats and building towards that, like, I think life gets a lot harder. Yes. Do you guys have a house view on the new competitive equilibrium with a lot of AI\nengineering really working? Well, I think there are a couple things. I think Marc talked about\nthis a little while ago,</p>\n<p>but what is an EPD team? Engineering product design team. Product development team. You normally have one product manager, maybe you have five to eight\nengineers and one designer. And now everybody has\nCursor and Claude Code. So the designer is like, \"I don't need any of these bozos.\" The product manager says, \"I\ndon't need any of those bozos.\" Each of the engineers are like, \"I don't need any of these bozos.\" And they're all\u2014 It's like the start of \"The Dark Knight.\" And they're all right. It really is, it's\u2026 Exactly. And they're all right. It's like they're all\nwearing the Joker mask. Or, the Joker mask</p>\n<p>is Claude Code or Cursor. But the problem is, because I\nwas talking to one of my CEOs, this is a pretty scaled\ncompany, lots of revenue. And they use all these tools, they're not more efficient. And he is like, \"Why\naren't we more efficient?\" And it's two things. Number one, it's a real company, they have real customers. They can't just push things\nand hope for the best. But it's like you actually have an HR problem in that if you're building from scratch, granted you have nothing,\nyou have no tech debt, you don't really have to\nworry about customers, you don't have any,</p>\n<p>but you wouldn't have an\neight person EPD team. You would probably just\nhave each person... We have eight different product managers slash engineers slash whatever. Each one is a pod unto themselves. So that's one thing. I totally agree on the data moats where that has become more important. I'll tell you a story that you might like. I met this company, vLex. It's a 25-year-old company. This guy Alex bought up\nevery legal record in Spain, like probably going back to 1492. Buys the Ferdinand and Isabella...</p>\n<p>Here's the document, I'm going to take a picture of that, I'll sell it to every law firm. And he built like a $20 million a year SaaS business, bootstrapped for 25 years. And then it went to like a\nhundred million in one year. Now why is that? Because he used to sell this document or he used to sell a subscription to Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins and all these big law firms. And a paralegal would take that, they would turn it into a document.</p>\n<p><strong>[24:10]</strong></p>\n<p>They'd charge the client $10,000 and ChatGPT can't do that. GenAI can't do that. But you know who can do that is vLex. Another good example of this, of who has proprietary data? A lot of times, the data's free. This is the really cool thing. Or it's sitting, I wouldn't\ncall your data free, but it's not like for-sale data sets. Do you know domaintools.com? It's my favorite business. So DomainTools runs a cron job every day on\nevery single internet website. They do a WHOIS lookup</p>\n<p>every single day. And they build a historical record of that which no one has. So if you want to see who\nowned stripe.com in 1999, well, it was free in 1999. If you invented time machine,\ngo run that WHOIS query in your terminal but you can't do that. So you have to pay them. But all that data is free or FlightAware with ADS-B data. So you have a lot of these weird businesses. And of course this is not a new idea, like FactSet, Bloomberg... You have aggregators of data, but that becomes so much more valuable. Totally.</p>\n<p>Because your 10,000\ngeniuses cannot do that. 100%. You always experience this if you hire someone extraordinarily talented, like top of the class at MIT and you say, \"All right,\njoin the engineering team and go ship the code.\" And they ship something kind of crazy on the first day. And it's sort of slow. And it's like, you can have someone who is intellectually an absolute giant, but learning kind of how\na company does things the way it does. Learning the procedures and nuances</p>\n<p>of an organization takes time. It's part of what makes\nworking with interns or junior engineers fun. I think the learning curve\nis obviously immensely steep. And I think that the speed at which, with sufficient access to the data and the procedures of a company, they're going to get\nthere very, very fast. But these\nmoats are real, you know? Well, the other moat I would argue is the dark-mattered moat. Yes.\nAnd what I mean is you know, like the Milky Way, nobody could figure out\nwhy the mass is the mass because it's like all the observed stars and planets and everything else.</p>\n<p>It's, no, actually the vast\nmajority of the matter, or energy, because they're the same thing, is dark matter, dark energy. And what does that mean?\nNobody the hell knows. But it's just like, we don't know it. And for products, it's like you built, if I tell Claude, \"Go clone Ramp.\" Because this is the SaaSpocalypse that's happening right now. It's like, oh, of course. Well, I just went to the website and now I have a website\nthat looks like Ramp. No, no, no. There are like\nnine million edge cases. The tech debt sounds bad because it's a pejorative, debt = bad. But actually it's good because what you've\ndone is you've uncovered</p>\n<p>every single problem that can go wrong. The fact that, I mean, a great example, remember when the power\nwent out in San Francisco a month and a half ago? So we have this amazing\nthing called Waymo. Waymo had not figured out this corner case of what if the power goes out? It was a thundering herd\nproblem with the customer, or the human overrides, yeah. But they had no idea. And it's actually great\nthat that happened. You need these problems to happen.</p>\n<p><strong>[27:11]</strong></p>\n<p>For sure. And just because my background, I used to write shareware, this try-before-you-buy software. Shareware was a big thing. That's a blast from the past. It's a blast from the past. So there's a website that's part of CNET\u2014 That might come back, you know? Well, but it's freemium. This is where I'm going with this story and you'll like this. So Download.com was the preeminent site for downloading shareware. It was like... CNET was one of the most popular\nproperties in 1999, 2000. So, all of the top downloadable software products were there\u2014 Download.com sounds like a company that had a Super Bowl ad. They would've. I bet they did, actually.\nThey probably had two.</p>\n<p>I'd be shocked. They probably had five. Right between Pets.com and something else. So Download.com had all\nthe popular products and then this site called Elance shows up and Elance is now called Upwork. This connected you with work\nthat you would want done by very smart people, basically\nin the developing world. So I want a software product built. Here's everybody in Romania\nand Russia and India. I want translation, I want graphics. So what ended up happening is people would look at\nthe Download.com top list because before it was\na very cottage industry</p>\n<p>of who wrote shareware and\nit was very profitable. Like ID software shareware company, McAfee shareware company. Actually Cybersource started\noff processing payments for shareware companies. That's how they got McAfee. That's funny. Very interesting history to this we can talk about some other time, but basically what happened\nis people found Elance, like, \"Oh, I could pay anybody $500 to clone anything on this list. Everything on this list makes tens of millions of dollars a year. Let's go.\" And the cloning never worked. It functionally worked.</p>\n<p>Because if I say \"I'm\ngoing to clone Eric.\" I might not know that you have a pancreas. Right? I'm sure you do. I might not know that\nyou have two kidneys. So the problem is that cloning\njust, it goes skin deep and like that's the embedded\nadvantage of these companies. Do you then think the SaaSpocalypse is kind of irrational? I think it depends. I think some of it is very rational. Because if I want, if I have a feature that became a company, and I know this sounds like a very negative thing to say, but I want to get paged if\nmy server goes down. It's a very logical reason</p>\n<p>to build a company called PagerDuty. That now has a lot of stuff around it but I might just say, \"Hey,\nwhenever my servers...\" There are corner cases, there is the proverbial the\npower goes out in San Francisco, do something differently. That's very, very different than NetSuite, which is, I have a saying that I like, which is the best companies\nhave hostages, not customers, at least in enterprise software. Not for you because\nyou actually have INPS. But that they're much\nharder to go rip that out and a lot of it is like\nthe \"Goldilocks zone\" that you operate in.</p>\n<p>If you're too expensive, of course I'm going to\ntry to rip that thing out. If it's so cheap then I\nforgot nobody even used it. So you have to be in this Goldilocks zone, you have to have enough complexity. And ideally the front end is\ndifferent than the back end. So, Workday I think is... Nobody's going to get rid of Workday. And I actually credit\nDavid Ricardo with this. Like, comparative advantage. Sure, you could grow your own food.</p>\n<p><strong>[30:14]</strong></p>\n<p>You could plumb your own plumbing. But you're not going to do that. And somebody could do your own HR system. Yes. The one maybe pitch for Stripe and others that I would say here is, I do think that that is right. And there is a lot of complexity and local tax law for payments and things that make Workday an extraordinary business. There was this overarching\nmacro question of how does work get done? If you believe that.</p>\n<p>You know, work can\nget done through tokens and models. And presumably it doesn't go through payroll, probably goes through\na credit card or check to these types of companies. And so, the share of, it's almost this sort of simple math that if you X-rayed the\nP&L of most companies, the majority of it classically, at least for asset-light firms, is payroll. You're paying for people to do things and SaaS is maybe a small percentage of a company's income or\na company's cost base.</p>\n<p>Does suddenly that share\ngrow to high single digits, low double digits,\nsignificant double digits? And does the share actually move where, the payroll economy itself, even though maybe it grows,\nbecomes less relevant? I think this is the\nreally funny part of even as this has been going on, what do I know as a private company other than seeing our own payment data. But you start to see these companies beating their earnings</p>\n<p>in a way they never have before where the terminal value perhaps is falling out. But they're saying, \"Shareholders, we're reaccelerating.\" We haven't seen this since 2021. We're going faster and\nyou're going to have multiple progressive quarters of this actually occurring for\ncertain types of businesses. And so, it's a really\ninteresting time to... I very violently agree with your view is like yeah, it depends. But it's doing really well. That's my brilliant comment, it depends. Yeah, you mentioned... Very Howard Marks of you.</p>\n<p>As you're hearing from Eric, Ramp has become the default way a lot of American companies manage spend. Stablecoins allowed that\nfunctionality to work in many countries all at once. With Ramp's stablecoin-backed\ncorporate cards, businesses can fund a\nbalance with stablecoins, issue cards against\nthose balances instantly, and allow employees to spend\nanywhere cards are accepted without the business having to think about stablecoins all the time. Same card experience, same controls, just a much more global\nset of rails underneath. This is one of the many practical ways</p>\n<p>we're seeing businesses\non Stripe use stablecoins by launching card programs\nin many more countries and doing so in much less time than it would've taken otherwise. If you're thinking about\nusing stablecoins to expand, Stripe can help. You mentioned your spend data. What does the spend data that Ramp sees tell us about the economy?</p>\n<p><strong>[33:14]</strong></p>\n<p>I think it is stronger than many people\nunderstand in lots of ways. I mean first, I'll go\nback to one of the things that perplexed our team for a long time. Our economists on the team saw this data even as recently as last year were the Census Bureau would\ndo these periodic surveys. They'd go out and ask \"How much is your business using AI to produce goods or services?\" A very refined economic way</p>\n<p>of wording the questions. And they would come back with these pronouncements saying a single digit percent\nof businesses in the US have adopted AI. And we looked at our data and we support over 55,000 businesses. We lean a little bit towards\ntech but not heavily. It kind of resembles the\ndistribution of businesses you would see in the States. And well, the majority of\nbusinesses have used AI. You look at businesses\nwhether they're paying for\u2014 As in they subscribe\nto ChatGPT or Anthropic</p>\n<p>or something like that.\nExactly. Or, maybe a business that is a true agentic\u2026 Cognition or a Cursor, something like that where this is kind of\nvertical application. And so, one, there is\nthis disconnect between the use of tools if you look at how quickly businesses are adopting and responding to these new tools versus what maybe people\nreport on. Next: growth. I think it's been clear\nover the last few quarters is the US itself is reaccelerating, GDP growth is gone from\nmaybe the one to 2%,</p>\n<p>area to four to five and you could argue how much of this is, a little artificial with subsidies, but it's been pretty significant. But subsidized by what? Some of the Big Beautiful Bill as well as some of the tariffs. And where that's been reallocated, I think some people, I would argue on the whole maybe unfairly said this. I think that there's more durable growth inside of the businesses. But I would say overall business health is much stronger. And I think that the\nreally interesting thing</p>\n<p>and again some of this is\nspecific to the data that we see, but I think that businesses are generally getting more and more\nsavvy about finding tools that help them be more efficient. And I think what skews our data is maybe the savings we drive for people. Seems the way of explaining\nit is like people know the, Ben Franklin would say this phrase of \"a penny saved is a penny earned\" and this is awesome aphorism but the average American business has an 8% profit margin. And so mathematically speaking,\na penny saved is equivalent</p>\n<p>to 12 pennies of revenue earned. And so, if you save businesses a lot, you end up with these outcomes of the average Ramp bases\nmaterially outgrowing the regular US average. And we can clearly see this and demonstrate this for\nour own set of customers. I suspect these types of things are occurring at businesses adopting</p>\n<p><strong>[36:15]</strong></p>\n<p>these new sets of technologies, I would argue probably faster, very clearly, than what the US is maybe, the classic sources are seeing. So I think it's much healthier. When a business saves money\non Ramp, what happens? The CFO comes in and says, \"Oh my god, we're spending\u2014 Confetti.\n\"Way too much money, on confetti. We don't need this much confetti.\" Who's buying the confetti? \"We have huge stockpiles\nthat we don't need.\" What happens when a business saves 5%? What are they actually cutting? So there's two pieces of it primarily. One is like these hard-dollar cost savings</p>\n<p>and then some of this is time, and I'll start with the time\nbecause it's the squishy one, but I think that it's, in some cases, actually much more important. Oh sure, they save time on\ntheir expense reconciliation. That makes sense. So they're no longer\ngoing through line by line and therefore there's one person who is freed up\nto go do something else. Yeah. And I think one of the classic biases that people forget is people chronically undervalue their own time. As a principle of business, everyone has an hourly rate. Within a business, human\ntime is incredibly expensive.</p>\n<p>I think the lean companies got this right and eliminated the bottlenecks there. So, okay, that's one form. What else? Next, all right, when you start to have these fine-tuned kind of controls. This part has been I think probably the biggest lion's share of this. Let's go back to one of\nthe earlier conversations of why do people use checks, this horrible system and purchase orders. Well, one of the advantages of checks is unless you mail it to\nsomeone and you sign it, no money can leave your company. And what every person knows</p>\n<p>who's ever had a credit\ncard and gone to a gym once and had a good New Year's resolution. But is you go a couple times and you're like, \"Goddammit,\nthis gym is charging me.\" The difficulty of sending a\ncheck is a feature, not a bug. Yeah, exactly. But it's part of what Ramp was the first to build.\nOne-time use cards. Single-use cards, but also more than that, merchant blocking. So you can, whether it's on one card or 10,000 cards at once, build in a kill switch to say, \"Okay, we've signed this new\ndeal with this merchant. We are only on Uber,</p>\n<p>we are no longer taking Lyfts. And anytime someone goes and\ntries to go on merchant A or B, you can do this.\" Or you sign a new contract and you say, \"I'm going spend $10,000\nonly with Salesforce and on the 10,001th dollar\nthey try to charge you, it declines.\" And what gets to happen, you\nget to have a conversation with their sales team who really\nwants to make their budget. And if you look at this mathematically, for most companies that\ncome over a low end, maybe a very hygienic company that is giving out a few cards and the old world</p>\n<p>could durably cut their expenses about 2% a year by doing this. Some of these very\nlaissez-faire businesses are saving just 10%, just\nthrough these things. Next, you start ending up\nwith these more fine-tuned kind of controls where you can say under these circumstances I want to go and have\nkind of charges occur. Maybe you have an engineer\nstay till 8:00 PM at night,</p>\n<p><strong>[39:17]</strong></p>\n<p>you can go and buy a meal. But if you take an Uber on a\nSaturday, that should turn off. And so you have the cards, if it's like an Uber on\na Saturday auto-decline, but you can text and say\nactually it's for work. You send back a yes, it turns on. And so it's all these\nlittle tiny paper cuts that actually start to go into run. Next, it's vendor data. One of the unique assets of Ramp is anytime you spend money,\nyou upload a receipt, maybe you upload an invoice or an MSA. This takes us back to the Paribus days. We know across hundreds of\nmillions of purchases every year, not just that you spent\nmoney at a software vendor,</p>\n<p>but what did you spend per seat? And so if you're a customer on Ramp and you're about to go\nand pay this large bill on a random SaaS vendor, we can show you in real-time before you send the funds, you are paying 20% more\nthan the rest of the market. Here's kind of the cost curve of what others are paying. And actually by going and\nempowering your procurement team\u2014 Do you have enough data to do that? Because my AWS bill\nis not like your AWS bill. And so, don't you need to know how many instances we're running</p>\n<p>to know if this is a good deal or not? You can, but you can still\nkind of get down to the level of is there a bulk discount or not? And start to know of, is\nthere a negotiated aspect? There's other types of\nthings where I'd argue maybe a lot of classic software- as-a-service ends up in this way. It's like your pricing is\nreally dependent on, you know, did you sign that deal on January 1st or on December 31st when the sales team really needs to hit the quota. And you can actually see\ndown to the seat level, you're paying $30 per seat.</p>\n<p>It's a great time to be\nsigning a Salesforce contract. Exactly. And so you can actually get\ndown to the seat level and say, okay, you're about to auto-renew. The market price has actually\nmoved for the set of service. And so it can be very, very\nuseful to procurement teams to know where they\ncompare with the market. That was actually my question for you, which is, so if you remember Groupon\u2014 Yes.\nThe much beleaguered Groupon, but Groupon started off as a site called ThePoint.com/groupon because originally it was like,</p>\n<p>\"I don't like the fact that\nStarbucks uses paper cups. If I get 10,000 other\npeople to donate a dollar, we'll fly a plane in front\nof Howard Schultz's house,\" which also emits carbon, a bad example. But you only want, it's a\ncollective action thing. So, and then because I met Andrew Mason and Brad Keywell when they were first\nstarting this business, it was like eight people. It was ThePoint and downstairs there was a\npizza restaurant or something like, \"Oh, if get like 50 people to agree to buy pizza, maybe\nthey'll give us a lower price.\" The cause became discounts.</p>\n<p>Yes and then, but then the thing is Groupon wasn't known\nfor this \"it has to tip\" because they always had the demand. So they never had to worry about it because before it's\nlike you've got supply, you've got demand. I guess my question for you is, can you be the arbiter of pricing? Can you aggregate the demand? And the same way that like\nCostco, who shops at Costco? Every small restaurant shops at Costco. And Costco uses that\ncollective bargaining power,</p>\n<p><strong>[42:19]</strong></p>\n<p>if you will, to say, \"Hey Coca-Cola, give us a very, very low price.\" They take very, very little of that because right now I'm\nusing Ramp to buy stuff. Yes. But I would imagine if you could say, \"Hey, I have $100 billion.\" I didn't know it was that\nhigh, that's amazing. \"I have a hundred\nbillion dollars of spend. I can hopefully direct\nit this way or that way. Please give me a 20% discount.\" Can you do that? Or is that further in the funnel of the purchase process? There is this large swath of businesses that I've been fascinated by called group purchasing organizations.</p>\n<p>A lot of these came out of the healthcare world where it's a very small set of\u2014\nAPMs, yeah. Yeah, exactly, supplier. But if you can go and aggregate demand, you could say, okay, for\nthese type of purchases, you're going to offer this procedure at this account for\nthis type of equipment, you're going to give this\nlevel bulk kind of discount. And you've gone and you've done that and I think these are very popular now in the private equity world. Even when I look at Ramp data today, there are dozens of, and more and more every\nyear, of merchants where, you know, we were sending\nbillions of dollars. It is truly, it is the client's money,</p>\n<p>they are going where they're going. But we have a sense of actually, okay, where is this actually going? And can you go and say, you\nknow, across the Ramp buyer base over the next 12 months, this is how many dollars\nwill go towards you. Can we negotiate a discount? The other way which maybe starts to... Sometimes these businesses\nveer closer to advertising, but where it gets really interesting is we see the fastest-growing businesses. What are the businesses that people are getting really excited and are adopting really quickly?</p>\n<p>And we might have a signal of these are actually good\nbusinesses and good tools and actually most businesses\nshould move towards that. Could you go and actually start to say, \"Hey, your renewal is\ncoming up in 90 days. Have you considered this other business who has provided a 20%\ncomplimentary welcome lower price to you?\" And so, there's multiple\nforms that can take place. But the short version of it is, I think one, it's yes, I think you\ncan offer a bulk discount. But two, you end up\nalmost getting closer to,</p>\n<p>back to this other theme\nof can you start to go and maybe show businesses that directing their next marginal dollar will lead to this outcome. Well, it feels like there's\neven like a third thing. Which is, I would call it merchant-specific balance. So imagine that it's December 31st, I'm buying something at Whole Foods. And then I see an offer,\nnot donate a dollar to the, you know, whatever\ncharity they're pushing. But it's like, why don't you commit</p>\n<p>$2,000 of spend for 2026 for $1,800? And the nice thing there\nis that they lock in that spend for me. They actually collect it. I mean I know there's a stupid law and all this complicated stuff. But the key thing is it's\nalmost a risk management and a loyalty play for them at once. Because the problem is\nthat they don't know</p>\n<p><strong>[45:20]</strong></p>\n<p>how much celery to buy. They don't know how many... So, it kind goes back to the AR/AP thing that we were talking about earlier. You nailed it, yeah. Because the other thing\nis not just saying, \"Hey, I'm going to group bargain on behalf of all the different\ncustomers that I work with.\" But it's an ancillary\nthing, which is you might want to just pre-commit your\nspend to a particular vendor. And that vendor would love to\nhave that spend pre-committed, even if they're Amazon and their cost of capital is very low. Because they know they don't have to worry when they're planning their\nbudget for the next year. 100%. That you're going to churn in month nine.</p>\n<p>And that seems like another, like the closest that you can\nget to that is gift cards. Strangely enough which\nI'm sure you know well from your\u2014 It's gift cards for business.\nYeah because it's like you go to Costco, this is\nactually a big business at Costco. You go to Costco, they sell gift cards. We were just talking about this. So they sell gift cards. You can buy $100 of Starbucks\ngift cards for 80 bucks. Is Starbucks dumb? Like why are they, if they're worth $100? No, because they basically\nhave, in the ecosystem, money that is going to\nbe spent at Starbucks. And yeah, there's\nbreakage and other stuff, but it's actually a quite, it's quite a valuable value proposition</p>\n<p>for the receiving merchant because they know that\nyou're going to spend your money with them. But I want to go back\nto your previous idea where McDonald's every\nfive years or whatever does a big bake-off between Coke and Pepsi and they always renew with Coke and they have a long-time\u2026 Maybe a movie theater\nchain is better example. All the big chains, like they\ndon't serve Coke and Pepsi, they only serve one and\nthey do a big bake-off between the brands every five years. And you have lots of small businesses that are buying from Coke\nor buying from Pepsi. And so, it feels like you\ncould just do a bake-off between them saying Ramp is\ngoing to have a preferred vendor</p>\n<p>and you can obviously use a\nRamp card on either, it'll work, but we have preferred rates with Pepsi. Is that a thing Ramp should do? It's a really interesting question. The short is I think over\nthe long duration of time. Like I'm kind of bit of a crazy person. We should try everything\nis my actual answer. Claude Code.\nYeah, Claude Code. Let's go, let's do it, build it. Pepsi. Make money from Pepsi.\nGo and negotiate. The cost of a phone call, a negotiation has never been lower, but\u2026 And there's this almost\nphilosophical question of like,</p>\n<p>all right, where is the differentiation? What makes Ramp different? But isn't that increasingly the scale? It is, and I think that\nyou're right in that at the very beginning of the company, the answer was very easy of like, look, our cost of capital is\nnowhere close to a bank's. The interchange that we could\nmake is nowhere close to it. We have all the disadvantages of scale and kind of the only\nthing that we could do</p>\n<p>to compete with these people was we could\u2026 Everything was slow at the bank that I worked at before, it was hard to ship things. We need to move fast. We need to kind of have this\nemphasis around velocity to ship product and just\nkind of blitzkrieg faster than maybe others could respond. What it's evolved into and I think is today probably the largest point of\ndifferentiation at the meta level between Ramp and maybe the\nfinancial service providers</p>\n<p><strong>[48:25]</strong></p>\n<p>that we compete with is they sell money and we sell time. They'll sell you a lower, like a loan at a lower cost of capital, rewards at wherever they set it. We will sell your expenses, done. And so, are you naturally\nskeptical of this idea because it's selling money\nrather than selling time? I wouldn't say I'm naturally skeptical. I would say that\u2014 It's okay. We're not precious. We have lots more ideas. No, no, no. It's good. There is this question of, I think back to our\nroots, like, I don't know. How do you build a\nproduct that is 10 times better than other folks?</p>\n<p>And I think when you get really large, actually just a line drive is good and a 2x or a 3x is better\nkind of thing is actually good. But how do you find these sets of things that other your product\noffering is so different than what you can find elsewhere? And I think that we can conceivably, and I know this, you can negotiate with the large logistics companies. A deal with FedEx that would be better than\nwhat most companies are paying and I think that that's interesting. Then you have all the sublevels\nof how do you get people to know about the offer,\nto sign in to the offer, to deal with all these sub things.</p>\n<p>Or you could just go and\nspend that next marginal hour to go and say like, let's just automate all of accounting for these customers. Let's go and start doing financial\nwork for these customers. No financial institution\nis able to compete on that kind of vector. And so, I would say it in the fullness of time,\nwe want to do both. Like I think that you want to save people the maximum amount of time, the maximum amount of money that you can, but I think part of what\nmakes us so different in this kind of world that we operate in is we have this obsession of</p>\n<p>sources of drag of the things\nthat slow down purchases that lead you to overspend\nversus other companies. But just to push on that, I feel like the\ndifferentiation for companies often has to change as time goes on because they start in one\ncompetitive equilibrium. And then as time goes on, they're in another competitive equilibrium because it's dynamic. That's fair.\nAnd it feels to me that Ramp got its start with\nvery fast product velocity and having this great product experience.</p>\n<p>And as you grow up, you\ncan just build a scale into the product and scale\u2026 Scale-derived product advantages. Not just like we're big, but like Costco, the advantage comes from the scale and they really passed\nit on to the customer. And it feels like there could be a second stage to this rocket where you get going with\nfaster product velocity. But then there's actually\na pretty different set of product differentiations\nas you scale up. I think it's true. I think it's well said and there's this almost question of like, in every line of business\nthat we're building,</p>\n<p>where are we in the S-curve? How far are we\u2026 Is this a product that is serving these tinkerers, early adopters? Are we in the early\nmajority, are we in the late where we need to shift the\nbusiness to kind of harvesting</p>\n<p><strong>[51:25]</strong></p>\n<p>contribution, optimize\nprice, not quantity in it or towards the end? And the thing which is so shocking and I think maybe as part\nof why I love this business and I think even too, I think about Stripe and many of the great businesses and payments that have been built. I believe today Ramp powers\nmore than 2% of all corporate and small business card\ntransactions in the United States. Which is amazing for a business that, the product, you couldn't even\nsign up for it six years ago.</p>\n<p>And yet that's a really\nfancy way of saying 98% of spend is not on us. On Ramp yeah. And let's say we do it again. We grew faster last year than we did the year before. I feel very good about the way this year is starting off and maybe it's closer to four. 96% is still big. 92% is still big. It is so large. And by the way, there's more ways to buy things than just cards. You think about bill payments.</p>\n<p>And so, I think that\nthere is an aspect of, for most people, there's\nso much drudgery around... I think people are doing\nartisanal expense reports. You know, it's fun to be like a hipster and spend an hour making coffee, but like, it's a little crazy that\u2014 This is the blue bottle\nof expense reports. You know but unfortunately\nyou're in Concur and you have like this spinning wheel. It's a pour-over expense report. It's a pour, we love it that way. Single origin. You try it. It's the experience. You're the Nespresso. It's much more efficient.</p>\n<p>That's right. But like, what I would\nsay is this aspect of time is most people have not experienced this thing you know, is just a fact of life for building a business that's been hard doesn't need to be hard. Doing your books doesn't need to be hard. And so, I still think in some sense in where we are on the\nS-curves of our business, I lean that way. But you're totally right\nwhen you're at this level where in the not too distant future\u2026 I mean, you're there\nprocessing trillions of dollars</p>\n<p>per year in economic activity. And we aspire to be there in\nthe not too distant future. Sounds like you'll be there pretty soon. We're working our hardest. Exponential growth is a powerful thing. Yes, it's definitely given me good things to think about and work towards. So I was thinking about when we met, when you were running Paribus. And it kind of feels like one of the first or second or third order effects\nof AI is the marginal cost of arguing has gone down to zero. I'm serious.</p>\n<p>It's true.\nIt's just like, I mean, my wife got into an\nargument with some company and it's like she used\nChatGPT to argue with them, they used it to argue back with her. And it's like, I just saw the future. This is incredible. And like, we won, which is great.\nYour agent will talk to my agent, yeah. But you think about this from a chargeback where it's like, \"Hey, this price went down.\" I mean this is how we, I remember like, this is such a good idea. It's like the price went down, you have these breakage models\nthat the card networks had.</p>\n<p><strong>[54:27]</strong></p>\n<p>And Best Buy has to write you a check or Visa has to write you a check because that TV fell by 20%. But nobody does that. And now everybody's going to do that. Or it's like you do a chargeback for $5, it's just not worth it. It's like, I thought it was Pepsi that\nI was buying at McDonald's. It was Coke. Chargeback, right? Nobody's going to dispute that\nbecause the cost is too high, but now the cost goes to zero. So I'm just... What do you think, I mean, it's hard to, picture five years from now what the actual full effects of this are. But if you kind of think about that</p>\n<p>as the macro abstraction of it's like marginal cost of arguing goes to zero. What changes? I think to be really explicit, I think what's happening\nis the marginal cost of time, of knowledge.\nYes. That is a much better abstraction. Is what's going down so rapidly. And I think about our customer base. Most of our customers don't\nhave a single software engineer, let alone a software engineer\nfor their finance team. And if what we are very good at doing is selling functionally sets of work, maybe it's embedded in a\nfinancial operating platform,</p>\n<p>but expenses done, accounting done, some type of knowledge work done, and you can deliver that. That is immense high-leverage\nvalue for these customers. Let's say it costs $5 before, they didn't do it, now\nthey can get $5 of value. But maybe the cost of\u2026\nIt's a software type cost, maybe it's pennies of tokens\nto actually go and do that. That is a great business to be in because it's very high customer value. We can capture just a small amount of that and build this business.</p>\n<p>And when you go back to kind of the original insight of Ramp, we entered into this industry\nwhere it was very profitable, but not only was it misaligned, but people were fighting\nover like basis points. Every last dollar that went into rewards could have meant like tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in\nprofit for the business, for them. But if you think about for a customer, let's say that in order to\nmake one extra basis point as a business, you\nwould try to incent them</p>\n<p>to spend a hundred more dollars. For that customer and let's\nsay they buy something that gym membership they didn't need, or that subscription keeps going, they have lost $100,\nit's gone out the door and maybe they go to the\ngym, maybe they don't. But that is out of their bank account. And if you just try to say, I'm going to have a\nbetter rewards program, sure, maybe you can get that customer a dollar or $1.10 back or some amount. That pales in comparison\nto helping them just not spend that $100,\ncancel the subscription. The economic leverage of\nthat activity is much higher.</p>\n<p>You sold your last business\nParibus to Capital One. Capital One is one of the biggest founder-run financial firms that people in Silicon\nValley don't talk about. What should we all be... And has been extraordinarily successful. What should we all be\nlearning from Capital One in their success? Actually, I should say, how did they?</p>\n<p><strong>[57:28]</strong></p>\n<p>What product really broke out for them? Just what is Capital One success? I think there's a lot that makes them amazing as a company. Both the founders are excellent. Rich Fairbank, Nigel Morris. I think it's worth people\nreading up on their stories. It was founded in '90s, is that right? So, not quite. From a legal standpoint\u2014 I'm very wooly on my Capital One history. I think that legally the\nincorporation in some sense for Capital One, it was,\nI think it was in 1994, but the actual start\ntraces back to the '80s.</p>\n<p>At the time Rich and Nigel\nhad met, they were consultants and they had this insight that the business of credit cards was\u2026 While it was lucrative, was not\nserving most of the country. The way you could kind of think about credit cards back then, you know Diners Club, maybe\nothers have heard of it. It was was a way for rich business people to get together and have lunch. And like they put the card down</p>\n<p>and the restaurant would pick up the tab and they could go and pay\nthe restaurant back later. And they had kind of navigated that and the simplification is if you had a very high credit score, you could get one of these cards with the benefits that it had. And if you didn't have a\ncredit score that met that, you could have a debit card. And that was basically it. It was a very linear cutoff. And what Rich and Nigel\u2026 The\ninsight that they had had is there must be some curve.</p>\n<p>We should be able to test this. Maybe we give people cards that have above an 800 credit score\nor something like that then. But what about 790? There might be people there\nthat can go and pay for this. If and the way we could go\nand take on the cost of this, maybe we charge them a\nsomewhat higher interest rate until they prove their efficacy. If 790 works, let's go to 780. So it's kind of the BNPL of its day. There is a population who\nare, for whatever reason, just below the threshold where banks are giving them good access to credit</p>\n<p>where you can actually very\nprofitably lend to them. This is right. Exactly. And so, they, in the '80s,\nwere functionally pitching all these different banks to say, \"We should go on this exploration. We'll even run this for you. Let us go and run this.\" And they went door to door\nto door to door to door\u2014 The banks didn't buy it. They didn't buy it. And then finally, there was a\nbank in Virginia, Signet Bank, that said, \"Fine, we'll let you run it. You can come join. We'll give you this group</p>\n<p>and some resources to go build this.\" So they built this as this\ndivision inside of it. And it started to work. As this was going on, the computer revolution was taking off and it was sort of an unfortunate acronym, but they called it IBS. Irritable something something. No, it's Information-Based Strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>[60:29]</strong></p>\n<p>And they said, \"We could use\ndifferent pockets of data and run these.\" It was before there was big data, there was this kind of data\nof we could go and test. You know, maybe this person has a balance of $8,000 at this bank. We could send them an\noffer at this interest rate or this kind of you don't need to pay back interest for six months or 12 months. And they could start to go and see the mathematical\nreturn against this. And this division started really working and it got so profitable it became a problem for the business and they convinced them to spin it out.</p>\n<p>And so in 1994, that is\nthe founding as people know Capital One today. But it actually was I\nthink almost a decade in building to actually go and do this. I think that there was a lot\nthat they got really right. One, I think that they took much more of a first-principles\nview of the business. Whereas others said, \"This\nis a profitable product. I'm going to do it like the other person and use scale and\ndistribution advantages.\" They said, \"Well, let's think about the product nature itself.\" There's different, everyone's\nmaking money on interchange.</p>\n<p>Maybe there's lending could work and you could kind of\nhave different strategies for different types of populations. They did this so large where I think at one point\nthey were the largest customer of the US Postal Service. They would send out so many offers I think until Amazon took them over. There was a period of\ntime that they did this. So it's incredibly experimental. They kind of carved the path and showed how do you go\nfrom credit facilities for fintech founders, eventually maybe you become a bank or buy a bank and carve that path. So there's some tactical lessons. I also think they've done a great job</p>\n<p>of building a great and durable brand. One of the things that Capital\nOne has done very, very well I think has focused on like, what is the consistent visual message? What is the aesthetic\nand how do you stand out in this busy and different world? And so, there's a lot of pieces to what's made that company work, but\u2014 And they've also remained focused, which a lot of banks haven't. I would say so. Well, I think that is\na rewrite of history. They were doing like cell-phone financing,</p>\n<p>healthcare financing. They were a part of this thing. They have come back to focus\nafter wandering in the woods. They had some JV, it was like America One, I think it was called,\nto compete with Amazon. They were actually the most experimental business ever in a lot of ways. In, I think it was\nHibernia Bank in Louisiana. And this was after Hurricane Katrina. I think it was maybe during it or just after they were able to buy. And it was like, it was an\nexistential question for them. And I think that many\npeople worried about,</p>\n<p>you knew this like, well\ntoo from the BNPL businesses where if you're kind of\na lending-based business, and it's fine when interest rates are low, but if there's a crisis and people don't want to lend to you, it can just break your business. And so they had these kind of scares and they said we need a\nstable kind of cost base. Eventually they bought a bank, which was in a lot of ways very good.</p>\n<p><strong>[63:29]</strong></p>\n<p>They had kind of the deposits\nas this durable, stable, low cost of, or consistent capital base. But the flip side of buying it was they had to reconcile their culture of like crazy experimentation\nof trying everything to we're a regulated bank now. We got to be bank people. And it's more than just an attitude thing. If you are a nationally chartered bank\u2014 It's real strictures, yeah. You know, look, it's to a level of, let's say the bank fails on Monday night.</p>\n<p>There is personnel. These guys in windbreakers\nin your office the next day. And they've probably been working there for some time before. You know, and so it's... I think there was a change. In some sense, there is experimentation I think within certain constraints would be how I would describe the Capital One post buying\na bank versus before would be my read of it. But when you look at them\nin the '90s and 2000s,</p>\n<p>it was like them and in some ways, like name the high flying tech company. They were right up there in\nterms of share price growth. They started re-achieving it\nI think in the late 2010s. But it's a fascinating company. I mean, I think the talent pool. So at Affirm, our first like\nreally good risk person, but this is true for\nevery fintech company. It's just like, actually\nthis is kind of cool. Billy Alvarado, our first\nCOO grew up at Capital One. I had played the piano and my teacher was taught by somebody who was taught by somebody.</p>\n<p>There was actually a chart,\nyou can look this up. Czerny and Beethoven taught everybody who ever taught anybody. So like Lang Lang or Yuja Wang, like pick any famous pianist today. They can always trace their lineage 100% of the time to Czerny,\nCarl Czerny or Beethoven. Capital One is like the Czerny. Our Head of Risk Srinath\nSrinivasan, he's amazing, came from Capital. We had the same boss\n10 years apart actually, in some sense. And all the heads of risk\nfor all modern fintechs</p>\n<p>came from Capital One. Well, because it's one\nof these things where you know that you don't want\nto just hire for intercept, you want to hire for slope. And this is the problem is like you find, not to pick on Bank of America or Chase or somebody,\nbut it's like, all right, this person clearly knows\nhow to do their job. The bank that they work in\nis worth a lot of money. But they don't necessarily have, how do I put this delicately, the slope. They won't know what that means because they don't know what slope means. But seriously, the guy that we hired just so\u2026 He was very, very smart. And that was the key\nthing about Capital One</p>\n<p>is that they didn't hire banking people, they just hired smart people. And it became known as the\nplace where smart people went. And actually the fact that\ncompanies would poach people from Capital One actually\nadded to the alert. It's like, I want to work at McKinsey because at the end of McKinsey, I'm going to get a better job\nsomewhere else. Capital One job market. Capital One actually had, it did have that imprimatur. And I think part of it is</p>\n<p><strong>[66:29]</strong></p>\n<p>it's the only founder-led institution. Last question, Eric. We're talking about banking here. You have a treasury product. In five years, where do businesses keep their money? Is it with, I mean statistically mostly, you mentioned 2% on Ramp, it's even higher today\nin traditional banks like a Chase or a Bank of America. There's also neobanks, you know, I mean kind of bank-like\nentities like Mercury or Revolut or Monzo or things like that. There are companies like Ramp where you started in spend cards,</p>\n<p>but maybe moving more into treasury. How do you think that\nshakes out as a market? So, as a macro point, I think there is an\nincredible amount of money made by institutions who\nare enjoying the profit pool and sharing very little\nwith their end customers. You know, if you think\nabout the implications of like the federal overnight funds rate. This is basically saying, hey, if you want to go and\u2014 Just it's insane that there's\nso little yield sharing in the current market.</p>\n<p>It's crazy. I think that the national\naverage for businesses, right, these are sophisticated\nentities with personnel. They're supposed to be able to manage and put their funds in some\nplace that's more high yield. I think the national average on checking accounts is 0.07% in the US. And so I'm guessing you don't believe that Bank of America and JP\nMorgan and all these folks will wake up more altruistic one day. And so, what is the competitive process by which you think we'll get there? I think that new businesses, whether it's they have their own charter</p>\n<p>or they work with banks too that, this is not a monopoly. Like they have, everyone has competitors and it is a market that evolves. I think that that rate will go up, that the easier it is for people to, whether it's to create\ndepository institutions, create accounts at these institutions, or create stores of value maybe even outside of these systems, maybe in a stable currency. And so, I think that rate goes up. I think part of what's driven\nthe extremely rapid growth of Ramp Treasury is it's just</p>\n<p>a vastly better deal for customers. Maybe you keep three months of just walking around money\nin your checking account, but if you know the funds\nyou're going to receive and what you're paying out, well, we can move funds on the day payroll is coming due into that account and then every other day make\nsure the funds are earning the highest rate possible. And so, I think from a macro perspective, these things tend to go up in\nterms of the relative yield. I think there's another\nquestion of slack in the system. If you have more and more...</p>\n<p>Money can think, right? If the dollars in your company have some level of intelligence like it's able to kind of determine when can it be spent,\nunder what circumstances? It's increasingly recorded in real time</p>\n<p><strong>[69:33]</strong></p>\n<p>and there's some reasoning around this, some ability to kind of opine of where should the\nnext marginal dollar go? And you have systems that are able to think infinitely about these things even at 3:00 AM in the morning when most of your team is asleep. Well, once you determine, like maybe you'll determine\nI should keep the funds in some level in like a 2%\nor a 4% yielding account. But I think more of those\ndollars will go in flight actually to go spend to,\nif you have a business that makes an 8% profit margin a year, that's a lot higher than what you can earn</p>\n<p>in the overnight rate. And so in some sense, I think\nyou have the dual effect. Smarter capital allocation. I think more dollars will be put to work. I agree with Alex's macro point of if you kind of understand counterparties, you understand more information. I think that one, the cost\nof financing should go down and I think more dollars should be in the system in some sense. It's actually a waste for everyone to have your dollars just\nsitting in a bank account. Who does that benefit? But it goes back to your time point. And it's like the reason why I got mad at Chase a while ago,</p>\n<p>and I still have a Chase account. And like why is that? It's like I have a life insurance policy. I don't remember the login for it. It's just too much work. I wrote, this is a true story. Isn't this an issue if you die? Yeah, I mean. Well, but they'll pay my wife. I just don't know how to log in and change the bank account. So, they'll send her a nice\nletter I'm sure, some flowers. But, you know, why... Well actually, this is a true story. I wrote a check for\nsomebody's bar mitzvah. Mazel tov. Has not been deposited. Do I want to be the schmuck\nwho has the bounced check? No, I don't.</p>\n<p>So it's like I have to\u2014 This kid is keeping you at Chase. Well, great to see you. You too.\nEric, thank you. Thanks for the Guinness. It was a great time.</p>"}
